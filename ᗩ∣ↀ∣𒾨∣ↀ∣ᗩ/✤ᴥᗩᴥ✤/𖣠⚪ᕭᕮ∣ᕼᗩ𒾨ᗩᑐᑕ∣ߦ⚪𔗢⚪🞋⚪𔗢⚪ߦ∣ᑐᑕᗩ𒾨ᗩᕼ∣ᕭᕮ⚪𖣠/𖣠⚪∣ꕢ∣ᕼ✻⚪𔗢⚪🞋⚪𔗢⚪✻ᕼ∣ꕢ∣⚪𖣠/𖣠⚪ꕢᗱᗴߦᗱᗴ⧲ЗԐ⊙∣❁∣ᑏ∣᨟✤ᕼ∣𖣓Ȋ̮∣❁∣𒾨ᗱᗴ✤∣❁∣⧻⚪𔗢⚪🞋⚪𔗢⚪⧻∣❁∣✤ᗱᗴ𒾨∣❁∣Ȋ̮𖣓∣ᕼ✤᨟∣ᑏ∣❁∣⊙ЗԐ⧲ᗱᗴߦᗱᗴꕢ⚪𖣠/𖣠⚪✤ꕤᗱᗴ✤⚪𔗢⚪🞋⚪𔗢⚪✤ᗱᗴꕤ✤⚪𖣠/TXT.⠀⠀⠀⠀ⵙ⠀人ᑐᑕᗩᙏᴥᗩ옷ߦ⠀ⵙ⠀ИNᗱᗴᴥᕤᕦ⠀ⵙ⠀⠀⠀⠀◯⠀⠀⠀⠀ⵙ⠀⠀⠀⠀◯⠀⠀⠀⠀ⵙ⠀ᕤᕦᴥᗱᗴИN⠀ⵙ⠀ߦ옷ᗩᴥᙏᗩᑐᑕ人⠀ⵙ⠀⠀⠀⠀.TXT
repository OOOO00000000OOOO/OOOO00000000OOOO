THE GREEN PHARMACY
NY JAMES A. DUKE, PN.D.
"A DAZZLING BLEND OF HEALING, BOTANY, RESEARCH AND WISDOM. JIM
DUKE'S BOOK IS NOT ONLY WELL-RESEARCHED AND WELL-WRITTEN, IT IS FUN TO
READ. IF YOU ARE BEWILDERED BY ALL THE BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED
ON HERBAL HEALING, THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY!"
—MARK J. PLOTKIN, PH.D., ETHNOBOTANIST AND AUTHOR OF
TALES OF A SHAMAN'S APPRENTICE
"JIM DUKE WAS THE FIRST TO PIONEER THE CONCEPT OF FOOD AS DRUGS AND
BACK IT UP WITH FIRST-CLASS RESEARCH. NOW JIM HAS WRITTEN THE ULTIMATE
GUIDE, THE GREEN PHARMACY. IN OUR HOME, WE'VE FOLLOWED JIM'S RECIPES
FOR YEARS. THE GREEN PHARMACY ALLOWS YOU TO DO THE SAME. IT'S EASY TO
USE AND A HIGHLY RELIABLE HANDBOOK."
—BOB ARNOT, M.D., AUTHOR OF PERFECT WEIGHT CONTROL
"AMERICA'S 'HERBAL LAUREATE' HAS DONE IT AGAIN! JIM DUKE HAS
BROUGHT HIS ENERGY, ENTHUSIASM, EXPERTISE AND GENIUS TO THE PAGES OF THE
GREEN PHARMACY. FASCINATING READING FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN HEALTH
CARE AND HERBS."
—MICHAEL BALICK, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF ECONOMIC BOTANY AT THE
NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN
"[DR. DUKE] PUTS SO MUCH OF HIS OWN PERSONALITY INTO HIS WRITING THAT
THE READER FEELS AS IF SHE IS PARTICIPATING IN A FRIENDLY, INFORMATIVE AND
ENTERTAINING CONVERSATION. I THINK THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF HIS SUCCESS. THE
DEPTH OF HIS KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IS AMAZING—BUT, TO ME, EVEN
MORE IMPRESSIVE IS HIS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS
IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD, EASILY UNDERSTOOD AND SYMPATHETIC STYLE. WHAT
OTHER REFERENCE BOOK ON HEALTH CARE COULD BE SO HARD TO PUT DOWN? I READ
RIGHT THROUGH THE BOOK, FROM COVER TO COVER, AND LEARNED SOMETHING NEW
ON EVERY PAGE!"
—NANCY J. THIRNER, PROFESSOR IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES PROGRAM AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA
"THE GREEN PHARMACY IS A TOUR DE FORCE BY THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTHORITY ON THE HERBAL HEALING TRADITIONS. DR. DUKE'S NEW BOOK PROVIDES
A TREASURE HOUSE OF PRACTICAL ADVICE FOR THE NEWCOMER AND PEARLS OF
WISDOM FOR THE HERBAL PRACTITIONER. EVEN AFTER 25 YEARS OF STUDYING AND
USING BOTANICAL MEDICINES, I STILL LEARNED OF A USEFUL BOTANICAL ON ALMOST
EVERY PAGE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
—JOSEPH E. PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY, SEATTLE,
AUTHOR OF TOTAL WELLNESS AND CO-AUTHOR OF ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
NATURAL MEDICINE
"JIM DUKE, BOTANIST, MUSICIAN AND POET EXTRAORDINAIRE, RELATES IN HIS
INIMITABLE FOLKSY FASHION EVERY TRADITIONAL TALE AND BACKROOM BELIEF I
EVER HEARD—AND MANY THAT WERE BRAND NEW TO ME—REGARDING THE POSSIBLE USE OF HERBS FOR HEALING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THE BOOK IS
ARRANGED ALPHABETICALLY BY CONDITIONS REQUIRING TREATMENT AND QUOTES A
BROAD RANGE OF AUTHORITIES RANGING FROM DIET DOCTORS AND WORKING HERBALISTS TO THE GERMAN COMMISSION E. BUT THE DUKE'S OWN EXPERIENCES AND
BELIEFS, LIBERALLY SPRINKLED ON ALMOST EVERY PAGE, MAKE THE GREEN PHARMACY A FABULOUS READ—FULL OF FOLKLORE, FANTASY AND FUN."

T TAKES A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE TO MAKE A GOOD BOOK. IF THIS PROVES TO BE A GOOD
BOOK, AND I HOPE IT WILL, CREDITS ARE DUE TO MANY. FIRST OF ALL, FD LIKE TO THANK
THE STAFF AT RODALE PRESS, ESPECIALLY MY EDITOR, ALICE FEINSTEIN. SHE WAS THERE ALL
THE WAY, ALL THE TIME, TO HELP AND ADVISE ME AS I PLOWED THROUGH NEW LITERARY CROSSROADS. SHE STEERED ME TO A WRITER AND EDITOR I HAVE LONG ADMIRED, MICHAEL
CASTLEMAN, WHO WAS ABLE TO TAKE MY SCIENTIFIC JARGON AND TRANSLATE IT TO THE GENTLE
LANGUAGE YOU'LL READ IN THIS BOOK. IT'S INTERESTING FOR ME TO COMPARE THE STUFFY STUFF I
WROTE TO THE LAYMANESE GENERATED BY ALICE AND MICHAEL.
CLOSER TO HOME, THERE'S MY INCREDIBLE "RIGHT-HAND MAN," JUDI DUCELLIER. FOR 20
YEARS NOW, SHE HAS BEEN AN INDISPENSABLE AND PATIENT HELPER—FIRST AS SECRETARY,
THEN AS PROGRAM ASSISTANT AND CO-AUTHOR OF ONE OF MY BOOKS. AT HOME, THERE'S MY
WIFE, PEGGY, WHO'S GROWN WITH ME AS WE WHEELED THROUGH A RICH AND INTERESTING LIFE.
PEGGY DID THE ILLUSTRATIONS FOR THIS BOOK.
AS WITH SO MUCH IN LIFE, I'M INDEBTED TO SO MANY PEOPLE BESIDES THE FOUR MENTIONED ABOVE FOR HELPING ME SOLVE MY NITTY-GRITTY PROBLEMS. BUT I'M GOING TO STOP
RIGHT HERE, LEST I RUN THE RISK OF MAKING MANY PEOPLE UNHAPPY BY FAILING TO INCLUDE
THEM IN WHAT COULD EASILY BE A LIST THAT GOES ON FOR PAGES.
THERE ARE MORE THAN A HUNDRED DISEASES AND HUNDREDS OF HERBAL REMEDIES INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK, AND FVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FROM MAINE
TO PERU AS I'VE GATHERED THIS INFORMATION THROUGH THE YEARS. FVE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED ALL THE PARTICIPANTS IN MY FIELD CLASSES. I PROBABLY ENJOY MY CLASSES MORE THAN
THE PARTICIPANTS DO, BECAUSE THEY CONTINUALLY ADD TO MY STORE OF ANECDOTES WITH ALL
THE INTERESTING TIDBITS AND STORIES THEY PASS MY WAY. FLL WAGER THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED READERS RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES IN THESE PAGES, AND I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL
OF THEM.
FINALLY, IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY TEACHERS. MY GRADE SCHOOL
TEACHER, MISS HOME, AND MY HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER, MISS BEDDINGFIELD, ENCOURAGED
AND CATALYZED MY INTEREST IN THE OUTDOORS. MY MAJOR PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
NORTH CAROLINA, DR. A. E. RADFORD, TAUGHT ME THE FLORA OF THE CAROLINAS. C. RITCHIE
BELL TOOK ME TO MEXICO, GUATEMALA AND COSTA RICA AND PASSED ME ON, AS A POSTDOC, TO THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN. THERE, DR. EDGAR ANDERSON, DR. HUGH CUTLER,
DR. FRITZ WENT AND DR. R. E. WOODSON, JR., PUT SOME POLISH ON ME. EACH OF MY
TEACHERS CONTRIBUTED IN SOME WAY TO THIS BOOK, AND I THANK THEM FOR THEIR PATIENCE
AND GOOD WORK.
XIV
INTRODUCTION
S
INCE THE FIRST EDITION OF THE GREEN PHARMACY, I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS
LETTERS AND E-MAILS FROM READERS. MANY HAVE WRITTEN NOT ONLY TO THANK ME
FOR THE BOOK AND TO ASK ADVICE BUT ALSO TO TELL ME HOW THEY'VE USED HERBAL REMEDIES. THEIR STORIES ADD TO THE "ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE"—PLANT MEDICINE REALLY DOES
HELP PEOPLE IN HUNDREDS OF WAYS.
NOW THAT THE GREEN PHARMACY HAS ALSO BEEN TRANSLATED INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, I HOPE THAT THE GOOD NEWS WILL BE CARRIED EVEN FURTHER. IN TIME,
PERHAPS THIS INFORMATION WILL BE AS READILY USED BY DOCTORS AND PHARMACISTS AS IT
IS BY READERS. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF "GREEN PHARMACEUTICALS."
OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY REASONS BEHIND THE CURRENT WAVE OF INTEREST IN
HERBAL MEDICINES. FEAR OF SYNTHETIC PHARMACEUTICALS IS JUST ONE FACTOR. WE ALL
KNOW THAT SYNTHETIC MEDICINES—THE HARDCORE PHARMACEUTICALS—OFTEN HAVE DRAMATIC ACTIVITIES. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY CAN HAVE EVEN MORE DRAMATIC SIDE EFFECTS AS WELL. IN ONE DECADE, OVER HALF THE DRUGS APPROVED AS SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS
BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) HAD TO BE RECALLED AND RELABELED BECAUSE OF UNANTICIPATED SIDE EFFECTS.
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER REASON FOR THE SURGE OF INTEREST IN GREEN PHARMACEUTICALS.
ALL LIVING HERBS CONTAIN THOUSANDS OF CHEMICALS, AND WHEN YOU SELECT HERBAL MEDICINE, YOU ARE GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THE COMBINATIONS OF THOSE CHEMICALS. WHEN
YOU TAKE A SINGLE, MONOCHEMICAL, SYNTHETIC COMPOUND, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WILL
PROBABLY HELP IF IT HAS BEEN WELL-PROVEN AND IF YOUR DIAGNOSIS IS CORRECT. BUT ONLY
RARELY CAN IT ADDRESS RELATED, MINOR PROBLEMS—OF WHICH THERE CAN BE DOZENS.
AN HERBAL REMEDY IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO HELP IF YOU HAVE BEEN MISDIAGNOSED
OR IF YOU HAVE RELATED PROBLEMS. THOUSANDS OF "BUFFERED REACTIONS" ARE GOING ON IN
EACH OF OUR CELLS AS THOSE CELLS TRY TO KEEP US IN A STATE OF OPTIMAL HEALTH. WITH
HERBAL MEDICINE, YOU HELP YOUR CELLS MAINTAIN THAT STATE OF OPTIMAL EQUILIBRIUM.
PLANT FOOD AND HERBAL MEDICINE HELP IN ANOTHER WAY AS WELL: BY PROVIDING NUTRIENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO LIFE. RESEARCH HAS NOW SHOWN THAT MANY OF US ARE DEFICIENT IN SEVERAL NUTRIENTS ESSENTIAL TO OPTIMAL HEALTH, IF NOT ESSENTIAL TO LIFE ITSELF.
MANY OF THESE IMPORTANT, NATURAL INGREDIENTS ARE FOUND IN HERBS, BUT NOT IN SYNTHETIC PHARMACEUTICALS.
WHEN SYNTHETIC DRUGS ARE MADE FROM PLANTS, WE TEND TO ISOLATE ONE OR ANOTHER
CHEMICAL AND THROW AWAY THE REST OF THE PLANT AND ITS MEDICINAL POTENTIAL. THE
XV
INTRODUCTION
FAVA BEAN, FOR INSTANCE, CONTAINS INGREDIENTS THAT COULD BE EXTRACTED AND USED AS
"MAGIC-BULLET" PHARMACEUTICALS—SUCH AS L-DOPA, WHICH IS USED IN THE TREATMENT
OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE.
BUT WHY THROW AWAY THE REST OF THE BEAN TO MAKE A PROPRIETARY MONOCHEMICAL MEDICINE THAT CAN BE PATENTED BY A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY? WE SHOULD, INSTEAD, BE STUDYING THE SYNERGISTIC ENERGIES OF ALL THOSE PHYTOCHEMICALS AND
DISCOVERING HOW THEY WORK SO WELL TOGETHER. THOSE ARE THE STUDIES THAT WILL LEAD
US TO A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MANY HEALING QUALITIES OF MEDICINAL PLANTS.
AMONG THE READERS' LETTERS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF QUERIES ABOUT THE
MEDICINES THAT I RECOMMEND FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY. NATURALLY, MY OWN FIRST
CHOICE WILL ALWAYS BE GREEN PHARMACEUTICALS. PEERING INTO MY "MEDICINE CHEST,"
I SEE THAT MORE THAN 95 PERCENT OF THE MEDICINES I TAKE REGULARLY COME FROM THE
GREEN PHARMACY, AND I TAKE MOST OF THEM FOR PREVENTIVE REASONS. IN FACT, OVER THE
COURSE OF ONE YEAR, I TOOK FEWER THAN A DOZEN PHARMACEUTICALS—ALL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES FOR A PAINFUL KNEE. THE REST WERE HERBALS.
EVERY DAY, I TAKE CELERY OR CELERY SEED CONCENTRATE FOR THE PREVENTION OF GOUT.
IT CONTAINS NEARLY TWO DOZEN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS.
I ALSO TAKE GARLIC. SINCE SOME HISTORY OF COLON CANCER RUNS IN MY FAMILY, I USE
THE GARLIC TO HELP PREVENT CANCER. IT ALSO HELPS PREVENT COLDS AND FLU. FOR THE SAME
REASONS, I BOOST MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH ECHINACEA.
AMONG MY OTHER "CHOSEN" HERBS ARE SAW PALMETTO TO PREVENT OR SLOW DETERIORATION OF THE PROSTATE, BILBERRY TO GUARD AGAINST VISION LOSS, AND MILK THISDE, A
MEASURE AGAINST DETERIORATION OF THE LIVER. GINKGO ALSO OCCUPIES AN IMPORTANT
PLACE IN MY MEDICINE CHEST. IT HELPS PREVENT MEMORY LOSS, AND IT MIGHT EVEN SLOW
THE ADVANCE OF ALZHEIMER'S. (NO SIGNS OF THAT YET, BUT I'LL BE CAREFUL ALL THE SAME.)
I ALSO INCLUDE KAVA KAVA, ON OCCASION, TO HELP RELAX DURING STRESSFUL TIMES AND
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT TO HELP MY MOOD WHEN THE WINTER BLUES BEGIN TO SET IN. AMONG
THEIR OTHER BENEFITS, THESE HERBS HAVE A PREVENTIVE SIDE SINCE STRESS AND MILD DEPRESSION TAKE THEIR TOLL ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.
FINALLY, THERE'S EVENING PRIMROSE, WITH ITS GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID. COMBINED
WITH HAWTHORN AND GINKGO, THIS HERB CAN HELP PREVENT HEART PROBLEMS OR PROSTATITIS. AND I HAVE LICORICE IN MY MEDICINE CHEST TO HELP PREVENT ULCERS.
ALL THOSE HERBS—AND SCORES MORE—ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THIS BOOK. IN
THE PAGES AHEAD, YOU'LL LEARN HOW THESE HERBS CAN PREVENT OR HEAL AN ENORMOUS
VARIETY OF HEALTH CONDITIONS, RANGING FROM ALLERGIES AND ALTITUDE SICKNESS TO WARTS,
WORMS, WRINKLES AND YEAST INFECTIONS. YOU PROBABLY WON'T NEED ALL OF THEM. BUT
PERHAPS YOU'LL DECIDE, AS HAVE SO MANY OTHER READERS, WHICH OF THESE MANY HERBS
YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO YOUR PERSONAL MEDICINE CHEST.
AS I NOTED IN THE FIRST EDITION OF THE GREEN PHARMACY, THIS BOOK IS THE CULMINATION OF MANY DECADES OF WORK WITH MEDICINAL PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND
XVI
INTRODUCTION
MANY YEARS OF PLANT-HUNTING, FROM CHINA TO COSTA RICA, FROM PERU TO PENNSYLVANIA, FROM THE HILLS OF VIRGINIA TO THE UPPER REACHES OF THE AMAZON.
FOR MOST OF MY 35-YEAR CAREER, I WORKED FOR THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) AS A BOTANIST SPECIALIZING IN MEDICINAL PLANTS. TECHNICALLY, PM WHAT
IS KNOWN AS AN ETHNOBOTANIST, WHICH SIMPLY MEANS THAT I'VE STUDIED HOW PLANTS
ARE USED AS FOOD AND MEDICINE IN MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES. DURING MY CAREER, PVE
PERSONALLY SEEN MEDICINAL HERBS SUCCESSFULLY TREAT CONDITIONS THAT HIGH-TECH PHARMACEUTICALS COULD SCARCELY TOUCH.
IN PART ONE OF THIS BOOK, "YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY,'* YOU'LL FIND MY
ADVICE ABOUT FINDING, PREPARING AND EVEN GROWING HERBS. YOU'LL ALSO FIND MY ADVICE AND SAFETY CAUTIONS ABOUT USING THEM. THESE ARE BASED ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AS WELL AS AN EXTENSIVE DATABASE OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE VARIOUS
CHEMICALS AND COMPOUNDS FOUND IN PLANTS.
IN PART TWO, "CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL," I HAVE APPLIED A RATING SYSTEM
OF SORTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE HERBS AND HERBAL REMEDIES THAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST
EFFECTIVE FOR EACH OF THE DISEASES AND HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HERBS HAVE A THREE-LEAF ^^^. RATING. FOR ALTERNATE REMEDIES, HOWEVER,
BE SURE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HERBS WITH TWO-LEAF V^, AND ONE-LEAF V RATINGS. (I
COULD HAVE USED STARS, OF COURSE, BUT LEAVES SEEM A LOT MORE APPROPRIATE IN A BOOK
CALLED THE GREEN PHARMACY)
YOU'LL ALSO FIND THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK THAT I GIVE MANY SUBJECTIVE OPINIONS AS
WELL AS SOME PERSONAL ANECDOTES ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES WITH MEDICINAL PLANTS AND
NATURAL HEALING. SINCE THESE EXPERIENCES REALLY COME FROM A LIFETIME OF INTEREST, I
HOPE YOU'LL ALSO READ THE PERSONAL POSTSCRIPT ON PAGE 465.
BUT FIRST, WELCOME TO THIS EDITION OF THE GREEN PHARMACY.

ENTERING? THE GREEN
PHARMACY
I
F YOU'RE READING THIS BOOK, YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT AN HERB IS... OR DO
YOU? THE TERM HERB SHOULD BE EASY TO DEFINE, BUT ACTUALLY, IT'S SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT.
THE CLASSIC BOTANICAL DEFINITION IS THAT AN HERB IS A NONWOODY PLANT THAT
DIES DOWN TO ITS ROOTS EACH WINTER. CLEARLY, THIS DEFINITION WAS CONCOCTED BY
BOTANISTS IN A COLD CLIMATE, SPECIFICALLY THAT OF NORTHERN EUROPE. ACCORDING TO
THIS DEFINITION, THERE ARE NO HERBS IN THE AMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST, ONE OF THE
WORLD'S MOST BOTANICALLY DIVERSE, HERB-RICH HABITATS, BECAUSE THERE IS NO WINTER.
THE CLASSIC DEFINITION ALSO EXCLUDES WOODY TREES AND SHRUBS, INCLUDING
GINKGO AND HAWTHORN, TWO OF THE BIGGEST-SELLING MEDICINAL "HERBS" IN EUROPE.
THAT'S WHY SOME PEOPLE PREFER THE TERM BOTANICALS (AND BOTANICAL MEDICINE): IT
INCLUDES TREES AND SHRUBS AS WELL AS HERBS.
USING A BROADER DEFINITION, SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER AN HERB TO BE SIMPLY A
USEFUL PLANT. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS DEFINITION IS THAT IN ONE VERY IMPORTANT
SENSE, ALL GREEN PLANTS ARE USEFUL, EVEN THOSE THAT ARE NOT FOOD AND HAVE NO
PLACE IN MEDICINE OR COMMERCE. ALL GREEN PLANTS PERFORM PHOTOSYNTHESIS, COMBINING SUNLIGHT, CARBON DIOXIDE AND WATER AND RELEASING THE OXYGEN WE ALL
BREATHE. I'D SAY THAT'S PRETTY USEFUL.
FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE GREEN PHARMACY, I DEFINE AN HERB SIMPLY AS A
MEDICINAL PLANT. IT CAN BE WOODY OR NONWOODY, FROM A COLD CLIMATE OR A TROPICAL
ONE. IT CAN BE A WILD OR TAME FOOD, A WEED, A CULINARY SPICE OR WHATEVER. IT
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE GREEN. PLENTY OF BARKS, ROOTS AND PLANT PARTS THAT ARE
NOT GREEN ARE MEDICINAL AND THEREFORE PART OF THE GREEN PHARMACY. AND THERE
ARE A LOT OF MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT GREEN AND THAT DO DESERVE MORE ATTENTION THAN THEY'LL GET IN THIS BOOK.
THE GREEN PHARMACY CHALLENGE
MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM IN THE
WORLD—AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT ALL THE DOCTORS AND GOVERNMENT HEALTH EXPERTS KEEP
TRYING TO TELL US. BUT ANYONE WHO HAS EVER GOTTEN THE RUN-AROUND FROM A DOCTOR
OR HAD TO DEAL WITH A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY KNOWS THAT IF WHAT WE HAVE IS
1
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
THE BEST, THEN THE BEST STILL LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED.
MOST AMERICANS ASSUME THAT THE PHARMACEUTICALS THEIR DOCTORS PRESCRIBE
ARE UNQUESTIONABLY BETTER THAN THE HERBAL MEDICINES THAT FEW DOCTORS AND RELATIVELY FEW AMERICANS KNOW MUCH ABOUT. IT DELIGHTS ME TO NO END THAT THIS PICTURE IS CHANGING RAPIDLY.
I'VE BEEN A BOTANIST SPECIALIZING IN MEDICINAL PLANTS FOR MOST OF MY 30-YEAR
CAREER, AND I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN MEDICINAL HERBS SUCCESSFULLY TREAT CONDITIONS
THAT HIGH-TECH PHARMACEUTICALS COULD NOT TOUCH.
THE REASON HERBS ARE NOT MORE POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES IS THAT THE DRUG
COMPANIES CAN'T PATENT THEM. THE DRUG COMPANIES MAKE THEIR MONEY BY PULLING
THE MEDICINALLY ACTIVE MOLECULES OUT OF HERBS AND THEN TINKERING WITH THEM A
LITDE UNTIL THEY'RE CHEMICALLY UNIQUE. THE COMPANIES CAN THEN PATENT THEIR NEW
MOLECULES, GIVE THEM BRAND NAMES AND SELL THEM BACK TO US FOR A LOT MORE
MONEY THAN THEIR ORIGINAL HERBAL SOURCES COST.
HERBS ARE GOODM EAICINE
OF COURSE, THE DRUG COMPANIES ALWAYS SAY THAT THEIR UNIQUE MOLECULES ARE
BETTER, STRONGER, MORE TARGETED AND SAFER THAN HERBS. I'LL READILY AGREE THAT THEY
ARE STRONGER. IN FACT, THEY'RE OFTEN TOO STRONG AND HAVE BAD SIDE EFFECTS THAT THEIR
HERBAL PRECURSORS MIGHT NOT HAVE.
AS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS BEING BETTER, THAT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO SAY. IN SOME
STUDIES, HERBAL PRODUCTS CLEARLY PERFORM BETTER. GINGER, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN
SHOWN TO BE SUPERIOR TO PHARMACEUTICAL DIMENHYDRINATE (DRAMAMINE) AS A PREVENTIVE THERAPY FOR MOTION SICKNESS.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT PHARMACEUTICALS ARE BAD. I AM SAYING THAT WE NEED MORE
RESEARCH THAT TESTS HERBS AGAINST PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS. UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE
SIMPLY WON'T KNOW WHICH IS BETTER. THAT LEADS ME TO THE RATHER SHOCKING CONCLUSION THAT AMERICANS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GETTING THE BEST MEDICINE. THE
GREEN PHARMACY WITH ITS HERBAL THERAPIES MAY, IN MANY CASES, PROVE TO BE MORE
ECONOMICAL, MORE EFFECTIVE AND SAFER—ALL WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS—THAN THE
PHARMACEUTICALS.
OUR CHALLENGE IS TO TRANSCEND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE MADE BY DOCTORS,
THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE NARROW AND RESTRICTIVE DRUG APPROVAL PROCESS USED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OUR CHALLENGE IS
TO THINK GREEN—NOT THE MERCENARY, MONETARY GREEN OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS
BUT THE CLEANSING, EMPOWERING GREEN OF CHLOROPHYLL, THE GREEN THAT FEEDS, FUELS,
OXYGENATES AND MEDICATES OUR PLANET.
ECONOMICS DRIVES THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BUT WHAT DRIVES THE
7
PUTTING SAFETY FIRST
GREEN PHARMACY AND THE GREEN LIFESTYLE IN GENERAL IS ECOLOGY, THE IDEA THAT WE'RE
CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE PLANET AND THAT WE ALL THRIVE OR FALL TOGETHER.
PUTTING SAFETY FIRST
I
'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT HERBAL MEDICINE IS NOT RISK-FREE. TO BENEFIT
FROM USING HERBS, YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME BASIC BACKGROUND INFORMATION.
THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE HERBS YOU USE AND IN ANY HERBAL PRACTITIONER YOU CONSULT. THIS IS NO DIFIFERENT FROM CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE, WHERE
YOU NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOUR PHYSICIAN AND ANY PHARMACEUTICAL YOU
TAKE.
AS A RULE, HOWEVER, RATIONAL HERBAL MEDICINE IS SAFER THAN CONVENTIONAL
MEDICINE BECAUSE THE MEDICINES ARE MORE DILUTE AND SIDE EFFECTS TEND TO BE
LESS SEVERE.
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING HERBAL MEDICINES. YOU
ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS CAN GO WRONG. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT YOU CAN USE TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
FIRST OF ALL, GET THE RIGHT STUFF. UNLESS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF AN HERB'S
IDENTITY, DON'T TAKE IT. THIS RULE APPLIES MAINLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PICKING HERBS
IN THE WILD, OF COURSE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EAT POISONOUS OR DANGEROUS
PLANTS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY MISIDENTIFIED AN HERB AND TOOK SOMETHING OTHER
THAN WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TAKING. THE CLASSIC KILLER IS POISON HEMLOCK,
WHICH LOOKS RATHER LIKE WILD PARSLEY OR WILD PARSNIP.
THE UNIVERSE OF HERBS
WHILE THERE ARE SOME 300,000 HIGHER PLANT SPECIES THAT ARE ALL CHEMICALLY
DISTINCT, FEWER THAN 10 PERCENT OF THEM HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY SCREENED FOR THEIR
MEDICINAL AND TOXIC CONSTITUENTS. A REALLY GOOD HERBALIST MIGHT KNOW 1,000 TO
2,000 SPECIES, RARELY MORE.
THIS MEANS THAT EXPERIENCED AS WELL AS INEXPERIENCED HERBALISTS CAN MAKE
MISTAKES. NOT TOO LONG AGO, WHILE GATHERING HERBS FOR A WEEKEND CLASS IN THE
BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, YOURS TRULY GOT ALL EXCITED AT THE DISCOVERY OF SOME
"WILD GINSENG." LATER, ON CLOSER EXAMINATION, I WAS CHAGRINED TO DISCOVER THAT
THE SUPPOSED GINSENG WAS VIRGINIA CREEPER.

YOU R GUID E T O TH E GREE N PHARMAC Y
HERBS TO SHUN WHILE PREGNANT
AS A GENERAL RULE, YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE HERBS WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT UNLESS YOU DISCUSS YOUR SELECTIONS WITH YOUR OBSTETRICIAN.
THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR THIS. QUITE A FEW HERBS CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF MISCARRIAGE. MAINE HERBALIST DEB SOULE, AUTHOR OF THE FEMINIST HERBAL THE ROOTS OF
HEALING, ADVISES PREGNANT WOMEN TO AVOID THE FOLLOWING HERBS: BARBERRY ROOT BARK,
CASCARA SAGRADA, FEVERFEW, JUNIPER BERRIES, MUGWORT, PENNYROYAL, POKEROOT, RUE,
SENNA, SOUTHERNWOOD, TANSY, THUJA AND WORMWOOD. THAT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD ADVICE TO
ME, AND I WOULD ADD A FEW MORE TO THIS LIST: BALSAM PEAR, CHERVIL, CHINESE ANGELICA, HERNANDIA, HYPTIS, MAYAPPLE AND MOUNTAIN MINT. LATELY I'VE ALSO SEEN CAUTION FLAGS ABOUT EVENING PRIMROSE AND ST.-JOHNVWORT, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THE
RATIONALE BEHIND THESE CAVEATS.
IT'S ALSO A GOOD IDEA NOT TO BINGE ON CELERY OR PARSLEY. EATING A LITTLE OF THESE
HEALTHY VEGETABLES WON'T DO ANY HARM, BUT EATING A LOT COULD CONCEIVABLY CAUSE A
PROBLEM.
YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR CONSUMPTION OF CAFFEINE AS WELL. ONE STUDY SHOWED WHAT
THE RESEARCHERS CALLED A "STRONG ASSOCIATION OF CAFFEINE INTAKE DURING PREGNANCY AND
FETAL LOSS." AS LITTLE AS 163 MILLIGRAMS OF CAFFEINE PER DAY—THE AMOUNT IN ONE TO
TWO CUPS OF BREWED COFFEE—MIGHT DOUBLE THE RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION.
IN ADDITION, HERE ARE A FEW MORE "DON'TS" DURING PREGNANCY: DON'T SMOKE,
DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL, AND AGAIN, DON'T TAKE ANY DRUGS, INCLUDING OVER-THE-COUNTER
PRODUCTS, EXCEPT ON THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN.
L —— -. J
OF COURSE, HERBALISTS ARE NOT ALONE IN MAKING THE OCCASIONAL ERROR. PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACISTS MAKE THEM AS WELL. AND I PERSONALLY FEEL SAFER CONSULTING A WELL-INFORMED HERBALIST THAN I DO CONSULTING MOST DOCTORS. AS FOR THE
PERILS OF PHARMACEUTICALS, READ THE FINE PRINT ON LABELS OR IN THE ADVERTISEMENTS.
AS FOR THE IDENTITIES OF COMMERCIALLY PACKAGED HERBAL PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT ARE CHEMICALLY STANDARDIZED, YOU CAN USUALLY TRUST THE LABELS. BUT
EVEN WITH STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS, AS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS, THERE IS A VERY SMALL
BUT STILL REAL CHANCE FOR ERROR.
WATCHING OUT TOR PROBLEMS
WHATEVER HERB YOU'RE TAKING, I RECOMMEND THAT YOU LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU
CAN ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT FROM IT. IF ANYTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS, STOP TAKING
WHATEVER IT IS AND CHECK WITH AN EXPERT YOU TRUST.
4
PUTTING SAFETY FIRST
IN ADDITION, HERE'S SOME FURTHER ADVICE FOR ANYONE USING HERBAL MEDICINE.
MAKE SURE OF THE DIAGNOSIS. HERBAL DEVOTEES SOMETIMES GET THE IDEA
THAT THEY CAN DIAGNOSE ILLNESS AS WELL AS COME UP WITH HERBS TO TREAT IT. BUT DIAGNOSIS IS A SEPARATE ART AND ONE THAT IS BEST LEFT TO PHYSICIANS. I DISCOURAGE
SELF-DIAGNOSIS.
DIAGNOSING ILLNESS IS NOT EASY, AND SOMETIMES EVEN GOOD DOCTORS MAKE
MISTAKES. BUT PHYSICIANS' DIAGNOSTIC BATTING AVERAGE IS USUALLY BETTER THAN THAT
OF ANYONE WHO HAS NOT HAD MEDICAL TRAINING. ONCE YOU'RE CONFIDENT OF A DIAGNOSIS, THEN YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN HOW TO TREAT IT: DRUGS, HERBS,
SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO OR ANY OF THE FOREGOING PLUS DIET, EXERCISE AND
LIFESTYLE CHANGES. SOME HOLISTIC PHYSICIANS WILL STRESS DIET AND LIFESTYLE MORE
THAN DRUGS FOR SOME AILMENTS.
WATCH OUT FOR SIDE EFFECTS. I'M CONVINCED THAT ALL MEDICINES, NATURAL
OR SYNTHETIC, HAVE SIDE EFFECTS. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE AN ACTIVE PLANT CHEMICAL
(PHYTOCHEMICAL)—OR AN HERBAL MIXTURE CONTAINING THOUSANDS OF THEM—HAVING
JUST ONE TARGETED CHEMICAL REACTION IN OUR BODY. OF COURSE WE HAVE OTHER REACTIONS, UNRELATED TO THE ILLNESS, THAT COULD APPROPRIATELY BE TERMED SIDE EFFECTS—SOME DESIRABLE AND SOME UNDESIRABLE. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO WATCH
YOURSELF WHEN TAKING ANY NEW HERB FOR THE FIRST TIME.
IF YOU HAVE AN UNPLEASANT REACTION TO AN HERB, SUCH AS DIZZINESS, NAUSEA OR
HEADACHE, CUT BACK ON YOUR DOSAGE OR STOP TAKING THE HERB. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY.
IF THE HERB DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT, DON'T TAKE IT.
BE ALERT FOR ALLERGIC REACTIONS. PEOPLE CAN BE ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING.
EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO KNOWN ALLERGIES, YOU MIGHT BE ALLERGIC TO A NEW HERB THAT
YOU TRY. BE CAREFUL. AGAIN, LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. IF YOU DEVELOP ANY UNUSUAL
SYMPTOMS, STOP TAKING THE HERB AND CONSULT AN ALLERGIST OR PHYSICIAN.
IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTY BREATHING WITHIN 30 MINUTES OR SO OF TRYING
A NEW HERB, FOOD OR DRUG, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. YOU MAY BE HAVING AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION, THE MOST SEVERE FORM OF ALLERGIC REACTION, WHICH CAN PROVE
RAPIDLY FATAL UNLESS TREATED PROMPTLY.
ANAPHYLACTIC REACTIONS TO HERBS ARE RARE, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU NEED
TO BE UNDULY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT TRYING NEW THINGS. JUST BE CAREFUL AND UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBLE RISKS.
BEWARE OF INTERACTIONS. PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINES SOMETIMES INTERACT
BADLY WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH CERTAIN FOODS. THE SAME GOES FOR HERBAL MEDICINES, ALTHOUGH MANY HERBAL REFERENCE BOOKS NEGLECT TO MENTION THIS. ALWAYS
BE PARTICULARLY CAREFUL WHEN TAKING MORE THAN ONE DRUG OR HERB OR A COMBINATION OF A DRUG AND AN HERB. BAD INTERACTIONS ARE ALWAYS POSSIBLE. IF YOU SUSPECT A BAD INTERACTION, CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN OR PHARMACIST.
5
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
HERE'S ONE INTERACTION THAT YOU SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY AWARE OF: ANTIDEPRESSANTS KNOWN AS MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) INHIBITORS INTERACT BADLY WITH
WINE, CHEESE AND MANY OTHER FOODS. IF YOU TAKE A PHARMACEUTICAL MAO INHIBITOR, YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THESE FOODS.
THE ANTIDEPRESSANT HERB ST.-JOHN'S-WORT IS ALSO AN MAO INHIBITOR, SO THE
SAME FOOD RESTRICTIONS APPLY. IF YOU TAKE ST.-JOHN'S-WORT REGULARLY, CONSULT A
PHYSICIAN, PHARMACIST OR CONSUMER DRUG GUIDE ABOUT WHICH FOODS TO AVOID.
OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION. TOO MANY PEOPLE LISTEN TO BOTH THEIR
PHYSICIANS AND THEIR HERBALISTS AND DO WHAT BOTH ADVISE. USUALLY THERE'S NO
PROBLEM WITH THIS, SUCH AS WHEN A PHYSICIAN GIVES YOU SLEEPING PILLS FOR INSOMNIA, FOR EXAMPLE, AND AN HERBALIST RECOMMENDS A HOT BATH BEFORE BED WITH
A BLEND OF SEDATIVE AROMATHERAPY OILS.
BUT JUST AS TOO MANY COOKS CAN SPOIL THE BROTH, TOO MANY HEALTH PRACTITIONERS CAN ALSO BE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING. LET'S SAY YOUR PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBES AN MAO INHIBITOR FOR DEPRESSION, AND YOUR HERBALIST RECOMMENDS
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT, ALSO AN MAO INHIBITOR. YOU MAY WIND UP TAKING TOO MUCH. OR
LET'S SAY YOUR PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBES HALF AN ASPIRIN A DAY TO PREVENT HEART ATTACK, AND YOUR HERBALIST TELLS YOU TO DRINK A DAILY CUP OF TEA MADE FROM WILLOW
BARK OR WINTERGREEN. THE TEAS CONTAIN THE HERBAL EQUIVALENT OF ASPIRIN, AND YOU
MIGHT WIND UP TAKING MORE THAN YOU NEED, WITH MORE ANTI-CLOTTING ACTION THAN
YOU WANT.
TO AVOID THE TOO-MANY-COOKS PROBLEM, BE SURE TO TELL YOUR PHYSICIAN AND
YOUR HERBALIST ABOUT ALL THE MEDICINES YOU'RE TAKING AS WELL AS ANY UNUSUAL
FOODS YOU MIGHT BE EATING.
STOPPING
AND HARVESTING
THE GREEN PHARMACY
A
RE YOU INTERESTED IN HERBAL MEDICINES, BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW
TO GET STARTED? NEVER FEAR—THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK WILL HELP YOU,
WHETHER YOU'RE AN HERBAL NEOPHYTE JUST TAKING THE FIRST STEPS OR SOMEONE WHO
ALREADY USES HERBS ON A REGULAR BASIS.
THE CHAPTERS IN PART 2 OF THIS BOOK WILL TELL YOU WHICH HERBS YOU NEED TO
6
SHOPPIN G AND HARVESTIN G TH E GREE N PHARMAC Y
PREVENT AND TREAT SPECIFIC DISEASES. BUT BEFORE YOU EVER USE YOUR FIRST HERB, YOU
NEED TO KNOW HOW TO OBTAIN THEM.
THERE ARE, IN FACT, SEVERAL WAYS TO GET THE HERBS THAT I DISCUSS IN THE GREEN
PHARMACY. MANY YOU CAN BUY, BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT YOU MAY WANT TO PLANT,
HARVEST AND PROCESS YOURSELF.
IT'S QUICKER, EASIER AND SOMETIMES SAFER AND SURER TO SIMPLY BUY HERBAL
MEDICINES, BUT IN DOING SO, YOU FORGO THE EXERCISE AND MISS THE SPIRITUAL POWER
OF PLANTING, NURTURING, HARVESTING, PROCESSING AND PREPARING YOUR OWN GREEN
MEDICINES. PM AN AVID GARDENER. IF YOU ARE, TOO, YOU KNOW THE JOY IT BRINGS. BUT
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GO GREEN ON ANY LEVEL THAT SUITS YOU.
BUYING STAN JA RAIZED MEDICINAL HERTS
IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO BUY WHAT ARE KNOWN AS STANDARDIZED HERBAL
PRODUCTS AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB SHOP. IN FACT, THESE HERBAL PREPARATIONS
ARE GAINING IN POPULARITY SO RAPIDLY THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU'LL EVEN BE
ABLE TO FIND MANY OF THEM AT YOUR LOCAL DRUGSTORE.
STANDARDIZED MEANS THAT THE HERBAL PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED A BIT TO
GUARANTEE A KNOWN MINIMUM LEVEL OF ONE OR MORE OF THE MAJOR ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE THE BEST QUALITY YOU CAN PURCHASE. STANDARDIZATION
LARGELY COMPENSATES FOR THE NATURAL VARIABILITY YOU FIND IN BULK HERBS—THE
KIND AVAILABLE IN BINS OR JARS AND MEASURED OUT ACCORDING TO WEIGHT—AND IT
TAKES THE UNCERTAINTY OUT OF HERBAL PREPARATIONS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH
OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS YOU'RE GETTING.
UNFORTUNATELY, STANDARDIZATION MAKES HERBS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE BULK
HERB WOULD BE. EVEN SO, THESE "EXPENSIVE" STANDARDIZED HERBAL EXTRACTS ARE
STILL ONLY ABOUT A TENTH AS COSDY, ON AVERAGE, AS THE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT TREAT
THE SAME CONDITIONS, SO YOU'RE STILL WAY AHEAD WHEN YOU TAKE THE STANDARDIZED
GREEN ROUTE.
STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS DO VARY SOMEWHAT, BECAUSE THE LONGER THESE HERBAL
MEDICINES ARE STORED, THE LESS POTENT THEY BECOME. BUT THEN, PHARMACEUTICALS
ARE NOT PERFECT EITHER.
YOU CAN USUALLY FIND STANDARDIZED HERBAL EXTRACTS QUITE EASILY WHEREVER
HERBAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD. IF YOU DON'T SEE THEM, ASK FOR THEM. IF AN HERBAL
PRODUCT IS STANDARDIZED, IT WILL SAY SO ON THE LABEL.
WHA T TK E LATELS WON' T TELL YOU
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LABELS OF HERBAL PREPARATIONS OFTEN DON'T SAY MUCH ELSE.
THAT'S BECAUSE AN HERB MUST BE APPROVED AS A "DRUG" IN THE EYES OF THE FOOD
7
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) IN ORDER TO SPECIFY ITS MEDICAL OR THERAPEUTIC
USE. HERB MARKETERS MUST SPEND ON THE ORDER OF $200 MILLION PROVING TO THE
AGENCY'S SATISFACTION THAT THE HERB IN QUESTION IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO
JUSTIFY A MEDICINAL CLAIM. OF COURSE, ONLY THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES HAVE THIS
KIND OF MONEY, AND WHO IN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD SPEND MILLIONS TO PROVE THE
BENEFITS OF A PLANT NO ONE CAN PATENT?
IN THE SAME WAY, MANUFACTURERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM LABELING HERB PRODUCTS TO SPECIFY POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS. THAT'S BECAUSE THE FDA VIEWS THIS INFORMATION AS MEDICINAL CLAIMS. WITHOUT CLEAR LABELING, CONSUMERS ARE LEFT LARGELY
UNINFORMED.
ONE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK, OF COURSE, IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO USE HERBS SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. NEVERTHELESS,
I SINCERELY WISH THE FDA WOULD ALLOW GOOD INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED ON HERB
LABELS. ANYONE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION WHEN THEY BUY AN HERBAL
MEDICINE. I HOPE THAT IF ENOUGH OF US PESTER THE FDA LONG ENOUGH, PERHAPS
ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUY STANDARDIZED HERBS THAT ARE WELL-LABELED FOR
CONSUMERS.
HERE ARE A DOZEN VERY IMPORTANT MEDICINAL HERBS THAT I'D SUGGEST BUYING
AS STANDARDIZED PRODUCTS. (IF FOR ANY REASON YOU CAN'T BUY THE STANDARDIZED
PRODUCTS, IT'S CERTAINLY FINE TO USE THESE—WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GINKGO—AS
BULK HERBS.)
CALENDULA. BUY IT AS A SALVE TO TREAT BRUISES, CUTS AND SCRAPES.
CAMOMILE. A TINCTURE PROVIDES A RELIABLE SEDATIVE AND CAN BE USED TO
MAKE A STOMACH-SETDING TEA.
ECHINACEA. THE FLOWERS AND ROOTS STIMULATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO HELP
FIGHT DISEASE.
EVENING PRIMROSE. THIS FLOWER PRODUCES A VALUABLE SEED OIL THAT'S TOO
DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT AT HOME.
GINKGO. THIS HERB COMES FROM A HUGE TREE WHOSE LEAVES MUST BE
PROCESSED INTO A CONCENTRATED EXTRACT TO BE MEDICALLY USEFUL.
GINSENG. THE MEDICINAL ROOTS OF THIS PLANT DO NOT MATURE FOR AT LEAST FIVE
YEARS. IT IS TOO COMPLICATED TO GROW AND PROCESS THIS PLANT YOURSELF. (AT PRESENT, THE DEER ARE HARVESTING MY OWN GINSENG PATCH.)
HAWTHORN. THIS SLOW-GROWING SHRUB IS USEFUL FOR TREATING HEART PROBLEMS.
IT'S A POWERFUL MEDICINE THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN ONLY UNDER A DOCTOR'S SUPERVISION.
KAVA KAVA. THIS HERB IS A SAFE, MILD TRANQUILIZER THAT GROWS ONLY IN TROPICAL FORESTS.
LICORICE. HERE'S AN ANTI-ULCER HERB THAT IS SIMPLY TOO HARD TO GROW, AT
LEAST WHERE I COME FROM. (THIS FACT COMES FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS TRIED SEVERAL
8
SHOPPING AND HARVESTING THE GREEN PHARMACY
TIMES TO GROW LICORICE BUT HAS NEVER BEEN SUCCESSFUL.)
MILK THISTLE. THE PRICKLY LEAVES OF THIS HERB MAKE IT TOO PAINFUL TO HARVEST YOURSELF.
RED PEPPER. A PLANT THAT GROWS IN TROPICAL CLIMATES, RED PEPPER CONTAINS
A POTENT, PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUND—CAPSAICIN—THAT OFTEN SHOWS UP IN STANDARDIZED PRODUCTS.
TEATREE. A TROPICAL PLANT THAT WILL NOT GROW IN MOST OF THE UNITED STATES,
TEATREE IS AN EXCELLENT, WIDELY USED ANTISEPTIC.
BUYING BULK HERBS
I USE BULK HERBS FREQUENTLY, PICKING THEM BY THE HANDFUL IN MY SIX-ACRE
HERBAL VINEYARD, MY HOME OF 25 YEARS IN FULTON, MARYLAND. ALONG WITH MAKING
TEAS, I ALSO JUICE THEM, AND I FREQUENTLY ADD THEM TO FOODS AND BEVERAGES.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE INTO GARDENING TO GET BULK HERBS, HOWEVER. MANY
HEALTH FOOD STORES AND HERB SHOPS HAVE ROWS OF BINS OF DRIED BULK HERBS THAT SELL
FOR A REASONABLE PRICE.
THERE'S A DOWNSIDE, HOWEVER. WHETHER YOU BUY HERBS OR GROW THEM YOURSELF, YOU CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN OF THE LEVELS OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN BULK PLANT
MATERIAL. THIS IS THE MAIN SHORTCOMING OF BULK HERBAL MEDICINES COMPARED WITH
STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS AND PHARMACEUTICALS.
THE PAYOFF, TO MY WAY OF THINKING, IS THAT USING BULK HERBS GIVES YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIMENT A LITTLE MORE AND BECOME MORE INTIMATE WITH THE
PLANT. THIS PRODUCES A SPIRITUAL CONNECTION OF THE KIND AMERICAN INDIANS HAVE
LONG CELEBRATED. I BELIEVE THAT THIS SPIRITUAL CONNECTION IS THERAPEUTIC. IT ALWAYS
HAS BEEN FOR ME.
BUT WHAT ABOUT SAFETY?
NOT TO WORRY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS DISCUSSED IN THIS
BOOK ARE SAFE EVEN IN LARGE DOSES. AND IF YOU NEED TO USE SPECIAL CAUTION WITH A
PARTICULAR HERB OR WHEN TREATING A PARTICULAR HEALTH CONDITION, I LET YOU KNOW IN
THAT CHAPTER. SO USING BULK HERBS DOESN'T REALLY PRESENT MUCH OF A SAFETY ISSUE.
THE ONE CONCERN IS THAT WITH SOME BATCHES YOU MIGHT NOT GET ENOUGH POTENCY—
ENOUGH OF THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS—TO GIVE YOU THE THERAPEUTIC RESULTS YOU NEED.
THE VARIABILITY FACTOR
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SURE OF THE POTENCY OF BULK HERBS? THERE ARE MANY
REASONS.
GENETICS. DIFFERENT STRAINS OF AN HERB CAN HAVE GENETIC DIFFERENCES IN POTENCY. FOR EXAMPLE, LEVELS OF SANGUINARINE, A BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUND
9
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
FOUND IN THE ANTISEPTIC BLOODROOT PLANT, SANGUINARIA, MAY VARY TENFOLD BASED
ON THE GENETICS OF DIFFERENT PLANTS. AND VARIATIONS OF A THOUSANDFOLD OR TEN
THOUSANDFOLD MAY OCCUR EVEN WITHIN A GIVEN SPECIES OF THYME.
GROWING CONDITIONS. THESE AFFECT THE OVERALL HEALTH AND VIGOR OF THE
PLANT. PLANTS GROWN IN POOR SOIL UNDER STRESSFUL CLIMATE CONDITIONS MAY NOT
HAVE THE SAME POTENCY AS PLANTS GROWN IN RICH SOIL UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS.
(SURPRISINGLY, STRESSED PLANTS OFTEN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MEDICINAL COMPOUNDS.)
TIMING AND METHOD OF HARVESTING. THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE IN TASTE,
TEXTURE AND SUCCULENCE BETWEEN IMMATURE PEACHES AND RIPE PEACHES. HERBS
DON'T RIPEN AS FRUITS DO, BUT THE CONCENTRATIONS OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS VARY CONSIDERABLY DURING THEIR LIFE CYCLES. FOR OPTIMAL POTENCY, GINSENG ROOTS SHOULD
NOT BE HARVESTED BEFORE THEY ARE AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OLD, BUT SOME GROWERS HARVEST EARLIER TO RUSH THE ROOTS TO MARKET. THOSE ROOTS WON'T NECESSARILY CONTAIN
OPTIMAL LEVELS OF THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS.
DRYING. FRESH HERBS ARE MOST APPEALING. JUST THINK OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRESH MINT AND DRIED MINT. BOTH SMELL AND TASTE MINTY, BUT THE FRESH LEAF
IS MUCH MORE AROMATIC, MEANING THAT IT CONTAINS MORE OF ITS MEDICINAL OIL.
WHENEVER YOU SMELL AN HERB, IT LOSES A TINY BIT OF ITS ESSENCE AND POWER BECAUSE ITS POTENCY IS CONTAINED IN THE AROMATIC MOLECULES THAT LAND ON THE SMELL
RECEPTORS IN YOUR NOSE. ONCE THEY LEAVE THE PLANT, THEY'RE GONE.
OF COURSE, HERBS DON'T STAY FRESH FOR VERY LONG. THAT'S WHY THE CONVENTION
AMONG HERBALISTS IS TO DEVELOP RECIPES USING DRIED HERBS, WHICH CAN BE STORED
FAIRLY EASILY FOR MANY MONTHS. BUT THE LONGER YOU STORE THE HERBS, THE LESS POTENT THEY BECOME. LIGHT, OXYGEN AND HEAT TRIGGER CHEMICAL CHANGES THAT MAKE
THEM LOSE POTENCY—GO STALE—OVER TIME. THAT'S WHY MOST HERBALISTS RECOMMEND STORING DRIED HERBS IN AIRTIGHT, DARK GLASS CONTAINERS AND KEEPING THEM
COOL. CAREFUL STORAGE GREATLY EXTENDS SHELF LIFE.
PACKAGING. IN GENERAL, THE BEST WAY TO BE SURE OF PRESERVING AN HERBAL
MEDICINE'S POTENCY IS TO BUY AN ALCOHOL TINCTURE OR A GLYCERIN EXTRACT. THESE
CAN REMAIN POTENT FOR A YEAR OR SO. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR HERBS IN TEA
BAGS, POWDERED HERBS OR HERBAL CAPSULES, UNLESS THEY ARE GUARDED BY ADDED
ANTIOXIDANTS. THEY ARE QUICKER TO SUFFER DAMAGE FROM LIGHT, OXYGEN AND HEAT.
AAAINGF SOME SPICE
IN ADDITION TO THE MANY HERBS THAT YOU CAN BUY IN BULK OR STANDARDIZED
FORM, THERE ARE MANY SPICES THAT DOUBLE AS MEDICINES. YOU PROBABLY ALREADY
HAVE SOME OF THEM IN YOUR SPICE RACK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CAPSICUM, GARLIC,
10
SHOPPING AND HARVESTING THE GREEN PHARMACY
GINGER AND TURMERIC, THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS AND, AGAIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GARLIC, MOST ARE TROPICAL PLANTS
THAT DON'T GROW WELL HERE. SO YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO BUY THEM IN BULK OR POWDERED FORM.
ALLSPICE. THIS TROPICAL HERB HAS A COMPLEX AROMA AND IS USEFUL FOR INDIGESTION.
CARDAMOM. AN EXPENSIVE SPICE, CARDAMOM CAN BE A MILD STIMULANT.
CINNAMON. THIS COMMON, TASTY SPICE HAS POTENT ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION AND
CAN SETTLE AN UPSET STOMACH.
CLOVES. CLOVES HAVE PROVEN PAIN-RELIEVING AND ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES.
GARLIC. DESERVEDLY CALLED RUSSIAN PENICILLIN, THIS PUNGENT BULB IS USEFUL
IN PREVENTING OUR MAJOR KILLERS—HEART DISEASE AND CANCER.
GINGER. THE WORLD'S BEST NAUSEA PREVENTIVE, GINGER IS ALSO USEFUL IN
TREATING ARTHRITIS.
RED PEPPER. THIS NATIVE AMERICAN SPICE WORKS ON PAIN BY THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.
SESAME. THE SEEDS OF THIS PLANT ARE A GREAT SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND
OTHER THERAPEUTIC CHEMICALS.
TURMERIC. THIS YELLOW SPICE SHOWS GREAT PROMISE IN TREATING ARTHRITIS AND
DIABETES.
IN PEARCN OF WILD MEDICINALS
FORAGING FOR WILD HERBS IS KNOWN IN BOTANICAL LINGO AS WILDCRAFTING. WHEN
YOU'RE WILDCRAFTING, OF COURSE, YOU AREN'T DEALING WITH STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS. BUT
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXERCISE OF WILDCRAFTING, PLUS
THE SPIRITUAL CONNECTION TO THE PLANT AND THE FOREST WHERE IT GROWS, PROVIDES A
THERAPEUTIC POWER THAT MORE THAN COMPENSATES FOR THE LOSS OF EXACTNESS.
AS A BOTANIST, WILDCRAFTING IS EASY FOR ME. I KNOW MY PLANTS WELL AND HAVE
BEEN FORAGING IN THE WILD FOR MORE THAN 60 YEARS. OF COURSE, PICKING WILD MEDICINAL HERBS CAN BE HAZARDOUS, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY IT UNLESS YOU CAN POSITIVELY IDENTIFY THE PLANTS YOU'RE SELECTING. (I RECALL ONE ELDERLY COUPLE OUT WEST
WHO MISTOOK FOXGLOVE FOR COMFREY. UNFORTUNATELY, FOXGLOVE IS THE SOURCE OF THE
HEART-STIMULATING DRUG DIGITALIS, AND IT HAD FATAL CONSEQUENCES.)
I ADVISE ANYONE WHO IS NOT REALLY FAMILIAR WITH FIELD BOTANY TO STEER CLEAR OF
THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF HARVESTING WILD PLANTS. BUT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
DOING, IN JUST ABOUT ANY PART OF THE UNITED STATES YOU CAN HARVEST A BOUNTY OF
USEFUL MEDICINAL HERBS JUST BY STEPPING OUT YOUR FRONT DOOR.
11
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HERBS AT FIRST, YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF FUN
FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT THEM. MOST METROPOLITAN AREAS HAVE BOTANICAL ORGANIZATIONS—MUSEUM GROUPS, SCOUT GROUPS, HIKING CLUBS OR UNIVERSITY EXTENSION
DEPARTMENTS—THAT OFFER CLASSES IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF LOCAL EDIBLE AND MEDICINAL PLANTS. TAKE IT FROM A LONG-TIME FORAGER: HIKING IS MUCH MORE FUN WHEN
YOU CAN MUNCH YOUR WAY ALONG THE TRAIL.
GROWING YOUR OWN, INDOORS
LIKE WILDCRAFTING, GROWING YOUR OWN HERBS GIVES YOU NONSTANDARDIZED BULK
PLANT MATERIAL. BUT IT ALSO GIVES YOU AN EVEN DEEPER SPIRITUAL CONNECTION TO
YOUR MEDICINES THAN FORAGING, SO I'M ALL FOR IT.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU GROW, GARDENING IS A THERAPEUTIC, SELF-EMPOWERING
HOBBY. AND FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT MIND-BODY MEDICINE, FM CONFIDENT THAT
SELF-GROWN HERBAL MEDICINES SHOULD WORK BETTER THAN ANYTHING STORE-BOUGHT OR
FORAGED.
I LOVE MY HERBAL VINEYARD, BUT YOU DON'T NEED AN ESTATE—OR EVEN A
YARD—TO GROW MEDICINAL HERBS. ALL YOU NEED IS A KITCHEN WINDOWSILL WHERE
YOU CAN GROW A POTTED ALOE PLANT—YOUR INSTANT, HERBAL EMERGENCY KIT IN CASE
OF ACCIDENTAL BURNS. (JUST SNIP OFF A LEAF, SLIT IT OPEN AND APPLY THE YELLOW-GREEN
INNER LEAF GEL TO THE BURN.)
THERE ARE MANY OTHER HERBS THAT YOU CAN RAISE ON A WINDOWSILL OR ON YOUR
BACK PORCH. IF YOU'RE A CITY DWELLER, YOU CAN FIND SPACE IN A ROOF GARDEN, COURTYARD, BALCONY OR FIRE ESCAPE. QUITE A FEW MEDICINAL-CULINARY SPECIES THAT ARE
NATIVE TO SEMI-ARID CLIMATES WILL ALSO FLOURISH ON SUNNY KITCHEN WINDOWSILLS.
HERE ARE SOME TO CONSIDER.
BASIL. THIS INSECT-REPELLING HERB IS RECOMMENDED FOR TREATING BAD BREATH
AND HEADACHE.
CHIVES* ALONG WITH THEIR COUSINS GARLIC, LEEKS AND ONIONS, CHIVES HELP
PREVENT CANCER AND TREAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
DILL. THIS HERB IS DESERVEDLY FAMOUS AS A REMEDY FOR COLIC AND GAS.
FENNEL. THIS HERB IS GOOD FOR TREATING UPSET STOMACH AND INDIGESTION.
HYSSOP. MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE, HYSSOP CONTAINS SEVERAL ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS AND IS USEFUL IN TREATING HERPES. (IT'S ALSO UNDER REVIEW AS AN AIDS
THERAPY.)
LAVENDER. SOME VARIETIES OF THIS LOVELY HERB ARE LOADED WITH SEDATIVE
COMPOUNDS THAT CAN PENETRATE THE SKIN. TOSS A HANDFUL INTO YOUR BATHWATER IF
YOU WANT A NICE-SMELLING WAY TO RELAX.
PARSLEY. BEST KNOWN AS A GREAT SOURCE OF CHLOROPHYLL FOR COMBATING BAD
12
SHOPPIN G AND HARVESTIN G TH E GREE N PHARMAC Y
BREATH, PARSLEY IS RICH IN ZINC, WHICH IS GOOD FOR MEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. (YET
MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF PARSLEY SERVED IN RESTAURANTS IS THROWN AWAY.)
PEPPERMINT. THIS IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF COOLING, SOOTHING, STOMACH-SETDING MENTHOL.
ROSEMARY. RICH IN ANTIOXIDANTS, THIS TASTY CULINARY SPICE MAY HELP PREVENT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
SAGE. SAGE SHARES MUCH OF THE MEDICINAL POTENTIAL OF ROSEMARY.
SAVORY. EUROPEANS ADD THIS HERB TO BEAN DISHES TO REDUCE FLATULENCE.
THYME. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SOURCES OF THYMOL, AN ANTISEPTIC, STOMACHSOOTHING COMPOUND THAT HELPS PREVENT THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT CAUSE HEART ATTACK.
GROWING AN OUTDOOR HERB GARAEN
IN MY HERBAL VINEYARD, I HAVE SOME 200 SPECIES OF HERBS, MOST OF THEM
MEDICINAL. DURING THE GROWING SEASON, ONE OF MY GREAT PLEASURES IN LIFE IS TO
STROLL THE GROUNDS AND CHECK ON ALL THE PLANTS.
ALMOST HOURLY, WHEN I'M SPENDING THE DAY AT THE COMPUTER, I TAKE BREAKS
AND VISIT MY HERB GARDEN. WHEN I HARVEST A HANDFUL OF THIS OR THAT, I OFTEN SELECT MINTS TO MAKE UP ONE OF MY AROMATIC BEVERAGES, USUALLY HOT MINT TEA ON A
COOL MORNING OR ICED MINT TEA ON A HOT AFTERNOON.
GROWING AND LOVING THESE HERBS IS ONE OF THE MOST HEALTHFUL ACTIVITIES I ENGAGE IN, AND I HEARTILY RECOMMEND IT.
IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER BOOK TO TELL YOU HOW TO GROW ALL THE HERBS I DISCUSS IN
THE GREEN PHARMACY. BUT IF YOU DO HAVE GARDEN SPACE, HERE ARE THE PERENNIAL
MEDICINAL HERBS THAT I RECOMMEND. THEY FLOURISH IN MY OWN GARDEN, AND I
THINK THEY'LL DO WELL FOR ANYONE WHO GARDENS IN A TEMPERATE CLIMATE MORE OR
LESS LIKE MARYLAND'S.
CHASTEBERRY. A PERENNIAL FLOWERING SHRUB, THIS IS A GREAT HERB FOR TREATING
WOMEN'S PROBLEMS.
GOLDENSEAL. AN ANTIBIOTIC HERB, GOLDENSEAL GROWS BEST WHEN PLANTED IN A
SHADY AREA.
LEMON BALM. ALSO KNOWN AS MEHSSA, THIS WEEDY ANTIVIRAL MINT HAS SEDATIVE PROPERTIES. ALTHOUGH IT SOMETIMES LOOKS LIKE IT HAS DIED AWAY, IT ALWAYS
COMES BACK.
MOUNTAIN MINT. AN INSECT-REPELLING HERB THAT SHOULD BE MORE POPULAR
AMONG GARDENERS THAN IT IS.
OREGANO. ANOTHER WEEDY MINT—A GREAT SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS.
SELF-HEAL. THE REPUTATION OF THIS MINT AS A PANACEA IS ONLY SLIGHTLY EXAGGERATED.
13
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
SPEARMINT. THIS HERB IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS PEPPERMINT FOR SETTLING THE
STOMACH.
ST.-JOHNVWORT. SIMPLY THE BEST HERBAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.
TANSY. THIS HERB CONTAINS SOME OF THE SAME ANTI-MIGRAINE COMPOUNDS AS
FEVERFEW.
VALERIAN. THE ROOTS CONTAIN A GREAT ANXIETY-RELIEVING SEDATIVE. BUT BE
WARNED—THE TEA SMELLS LIKE DIRTY GYM SOCKS.
WILD YAM. MANY HERBALISTS RECOMMEND THIS HERB FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH.
WILLOW. THE WILLOW TREE'S EASY-PEELING BARK CONTAINS THE HERBAL VERSION
OF ASPIRIN.
HARVESTING ANA STORING HERBS
OKAY, SO YOU'VE GOT A BIG PEPPERMINT PATCH, OR WHATEVER, GROWING IN YOUR
GARDEN OR ON YOUR WINDOWSILL. NOW WHAT?
FIRST YOU MUST HARVEST YOUR HERBS. YOU CAN SNIP OFF LEAVES AND USE THEM
AS NEEDED. TAKING A CUE FROM THE AMERICAN INDIANS, THE ROMANTICS AMONG US
LIKE TO THANK THE HERB FOR SERVING US AND APOLOGIZE FOR MUTILATING IT.
DOWN IN PANAMA AND PERU, I LISTENED AS INDIAN SHAMANS SANG LONG CHANTS
TO THE HERBS THEY WERE ABOUT TO HARVEST, OFTEN WHILE FACING THE EAST. WHEN I'M
NOT IN A HURRY, I REMEMBER THAT THE PLANTS, TOO, HAVE LIVES, AND THAT THEIR LIVES
SUSTAIN OURS.
IN FACT, THE MORE WE CLIP THE LEAVES OF MEDICINAL PLANTS, THE MORE MEDICINAL THEY BECOME. THIS MAKES SENSE BOTANICALLY BECAUSE HERBS' MEDICINAL CONSTITUENTS ARE BASICALLY PART OF THE PLANT'S SELF-PROTECTION SYSTEM. HARVESTING THE
LEAVES MAKES THE PLANT RESPOND AS IF IT'S UNDER ATTACK (WHICH IT IS), SO IT PRODUCES MORE OF WHAT PROTECTS IT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INFECTIONS, INSECT INFESTATIONS AND LEAF-PLUCKING, AMONG OTHER ATTACKS ON THE PLANT, INCREASE THE
LEVELS OF SOME OF THE SAME CHEMICALS THAT WE VIEW AS MEDICINES.
COLLECTION TIMES
ALTHOUGH SOME HERBALISTS ARGUE FOR HARVESTING HERBS EARLY IN THE MORNING
WHILE THERE IS STILL DEW ON THEM, I DISAGREE. THAT DILUTES THE HERB WITH WATER,
MEANING THAT IT HAS PROPORTIONATELY MORE WATER AND LESS CHEMICAL UNTIL IT'S
DRIED. IN MY VIEW, YOU GET THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF PLANT CHEMICALS AND
THE LEAST WATER WHEN YOU COLLECT LEAVES DURING A HOT, DRY DAY, BUT BEFORE THE
LEAVES HAVE WILTED.
14
SHOPPIN G AND HARVESTIN G TH E GREE N PHARMAC Y
ROOTS ARE BEST COLLECTED IN SPRING OR FALL. BARK MAY BE COLLECTED IN SPRING,
ESPECIALLY IF THE COMPOUNDS YOU SEEK ARE IN THE LIVING BARK. IF YOU'RE COLLECTING
SEEDS FOR FOOD, I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE DRIED OUT AND
HARDENED. BUT IF YOU'RE HARVESTING THEM TO PLANT NEXT YEAR RATHER THAN TO USE
IMMEDIATELY, YOU MAY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'VE DRIED OUT.
FEEL FREE TO USE HERBS FRESH, ESPECIALLY IN COOKING. FRESH CULINARY HERBS
AND SPICES ALMOST ALWAYS TASTE BEST. YOU CAN ALSO FREEZE THEM, DRY THEM OR USE
THEM TO MAKE TINCTURES. (WHEN HARVESTING FRESH CULINARY HERBS, I GENERALLY USE
A PLASTIC BAG TO HELP RETAIN THE MOISTURE.)
PRESERVIN G THE GOOD S
IF YOU INTEND TO PRESERVE YOUR HERBS FOR FUTURE USE, IT'S CHEAPER TO DRY THEM.
COLLECT THEM IN A BROWN PAPER BAG RATHER THAN A PLASTIC BAG, AND WRITE THE
NAME OF THE PLANT AND THE COLLECTION DATE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BAG.
IF YOU DON'T STUFF IT TOO TIGHTLY, MANY HERBS CAN BE DRIED RIGHT IN THE BAG. I
ALWAYS MAKE A RUN THROUGH MY HERB GARDEN WITH PAPER BAGS BEFORE THE LAST
KILLING FROST, COLLECTING HERBS FOR MY WINTER MEDICINES, SOUPS AND TEAS.
CHECK YOUR BROWN-BAGGED HERBS AFTER ABOUT A WEEK, AND IF THEY ARE NOT
CLEARLY DRYING—BECOMING PAPERY AND CRUMBLY—SPREAD THEM OUT ON NEWSPAPERS OR CLEAN WOOD OR SCREEN IN A DRY, SHADED AREA SO THAT THEY CAN DRY BEFORE
MILDEW ATTACKS.
WHEN IT COMES TO SUCCESS IN DRYING, A GREAT DEAL DEPENDS ON YOUR LOCAL
WEATHER CONDITIONS. IN ARID WEATHER, HERBS MAY DRY TOO RAPIDLY, ESPECIALLY IN
DIRECT SUNLIGHT. IN HUMID AND ESPECIALLY IN FOGGY WEATHER, YOU MAY HAVE TO
APPLY HEAT BY BAKING THE HERBS IN AN OVEN TO GET THE MOISTURE OUT.
ONCE DRIED, HERBS CAN BE KEPT IN PAPER BAGS OR STUFFED INTO PLASTIC BAGS.
YOU CAN ALSO USE GLASS JARS WITH LIDS.
LIGHT, HEAT AND OXYGEN ARE THE ENEMIES OF HERB POTENCY, SO STORE YOUR
HERBS IN A COOL, DARK PLACE, LIKE A CELLAR OR CUPBOARD FAR FROM ANY HEAT SOURCE.
TO MINIMIZE THE OXYGEN AROUND STORED HERBS, FILL YOUR CONTAINERS AS FULL AS POSSIBLE AND MOVE THE HERBS TO SMALLER CONTAINERS AS YOU USE THEM.

USING
THE GREEN
T
HERE ARE MANY EASY WAYS TO USE MEDICINAL HERBS. WHETHER YOU USE
THEM AS FOODS, INTRODUCE THEM AS SEASONINGS OR MAKE TEAS, YOU'LL GET
THE BENEFIT OF THEIR HEALING PROPERTIES.
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST TAKING VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS. IN FACT, I
SUGGEST THEM FOR MANY OF THE CONDITIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS BOOK. BUT AN OUNCE
OF FRUIT OR VEGETABLES HAS MANY MORE USEFUL CONSTITUENTS THAN A POUND OF PURIFIED SUPPLEMENTS.
MY FAVORITE WAY TO USE HERBS IS SIMPLY AS FOODS OR MIXED INTO FOODS. IN THE
UNITED STATES, WE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOODS AND DRUGS, BUT IN MANY
CASES THERE IS NO REAL DIFFERENCE. IS GARLIC, FOR EXAMPLE, A FOOD OR A DRUG? THE
CORRECT ANSWER IS THAT IT'S BOTH. THE SAME GOES FOR ALL OF THE CULINARY SPICES AND
MANY OF THE HERBS DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK.
MAKING MEALS TKAT HEAL
WHEN IT COMES TO MEALS THAT HEAL, I THINK IT'S HARD TO BEAT A BIG MIXED
GREEN SALAD, A BOWL OF VEGETABLE SOUP (MINESTRONE, WHICH I OFTEN CALL MEDISTRONE) AND A FRUIT SALAD TOPPED WITH SOME HERBS SUCH AS MINT, BASIL OR CINNAMON.
IN THE EARLY 1990S, I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM OF THE
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH). THE IDEA WAS TO IDENTIFY MEDICINAL CHEMICALS, SUCH AS PLANT ESTROGENS (PHYTOESTROGENS), WHICH APPEAR TO REDUCE THE RISK
OF BREAST CANCER, IN PLANTS AND TO BREED OR AUGMENT THESE CHEMICALS IN FOOD
PLANTS.
WHILE THE PEOPLE I WORKED WITH IN THE DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM WERE ALL
VERY BRIGHT, CHARMING AND WELL-INTENTIONED, WE HAD SOME DIFFERENCES OF
OPINION. THEY WANTED TO PUMP PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS) INTO FOODS,
WHILE I KEPT SAYING THAT THE BENEFICIAL CHEMICALS WERE ALREADY THERE—IF YOU
KNEW WHERE TO LOOK. FOR EXAMPLE, PHYTOESTROGENS ABOUND IN MOST BEANS. IF YOU
WANT TO TAKE A BIG STEP TOWARD PREVENTING BREAST CANCER, EAT BEAN SOUP OR A
BEAN SALAD A FEW TIMES A WEEK, TRY SOME MEXICAN FOOD WITH REFRIED BEANS OR
ADD TOFU TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

T H E MOR E SERVINGS, TH E BETTE R
MANY OF THOSE IN THE DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM ENDORSED THE STRIVE FOR FIVE
PROGRAM PROMOTED BY THE NIH TO ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO EAT FIVE SERVINGS A
DAY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AS
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION INCREASES, RISK OF ALL THE MAJOR CANCERS DECREASES. IN FACT, THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE, DIABETES AND MANY OTHER DISEASES
DECLINES AS WELL. BASED ON THIS RESEARCH, THE NIH FIGURED THAT IT WAS PRUDENT TO
RECOMMEND AT LEAST FIVE SERVINGS A DAY OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES.
UNFORTUNATELY, FEW AMERICANS GET THEIR FIVE A DAY. AND EVEN THAT GOAL IS
SHORTSIGHTED, IN MY OPINION. I PERSONALLY THINK PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE FOR AT LEAST
TEN A DAY—FIVE FRUITS AND FIVE VEGGIES, SEASONED WITH FIVE DIFFERENT HERBS AND
GARNISHED WITH FIVE DIFFERENT NUTS.
AS HIPPOCRATES SUPPOSEDLY SAID, "LET YOUR FOOD BE YOUR MEDICINE." AMEN
TO THAT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ADD LOTS OF MEDICINAL SPICES.
TO ENCOURAGE AS MANY SERVINGS OF HEALING FOODS AS POSSIBLE, I'VE SCATTERED
SEVERAL RECIPES THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK. BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER PRETEND TO
BE A GREAT COOK: I RARELY MEASURE INGREDIENTS AT HOME, AND I ALMOST NEVER COOK
THE SAME DISH EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. I GO WITH A LITTLE OF THIS AND A HANDFUL OF
THAT, TRUSTING MY TASTE BUDS AND THE WISDOM OF USING AS BROAD A RANGE OF FRUITS,
VEGETABLES AND HERBS AS POSSIBLE. MY "RECIPES" MAY SEEM IMPRECISE AT TIMES,
BUT THE OBJECTIVE IS TO GET YOU TO EXPERIMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THESE
TASTY HERBS. WHAT PLEASES YOUR PALATE MAY NOT PLEASE MINE, AND VICE VERSA.
H OW TO MAKE A HEALING TEA
YOU CAN MAKE A GOOD TEA WITH DRIED HERBS. YOU CAN EVEN POP OPEN CAPSULES OF POWDERED HERBS AND USE THE CONTENTS TO MAKE TEA. BUT WHENEVER POSSIBLE, I USE FRESH HERBS, AT LEAST IN SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL.
WHY? SIMPLY BECAUSE FRESH HERBS ARE MORE FUN AND MORE FLAVORFUL.
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRESH HERBS AND DRIED HERBS IS THEIR WATER
CONTENT. LEAF FOR LEAF, HERBS RETAIN THEIR SUPPLY OF MEDICINAL PHYTOCHEMICALS
EVEN AFTER THEY'VE BEEN DRIED FOR A WHILE. BUT PHYTOCHEMICALS ARE MORE CONCENTRATED IN DRIED HERBS BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN LESS WATER. WHILE FRESH HERBS
ARE ABOUT 80 PERCENT WATER, DRIED ARE ONLY ABOUT 20 PERCENT. SO OUNCE FOR
OUNCE, THE DRIED HERB IS MORE POTENT, AND WHEN YOU ADD IT TO WATER, MORE OF THE
PHYTOCHEMICALS ARE INFUSED IN THE TEA.
HERBAL TEA RECIPES USUALLY ASSUME THAT YOU'RE STARTING WITH DRIED HERB MATERIAL. IF YOU HAVE FRESH HERBS ON HAND, YOU'LL NEED TO USE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS
THE RECIPE CALLS FOR IF YOU WANT TO GET THE SAME POTENCY.
17
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
TO INRUSE OR DECOCT?
THERE ARE REALLY TWO TYPES OF TEAS—INFUSIONS AND DECOCTIONS. AN INFUSION IS
SIMILAR TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS TEA. BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
BEVERAGE TEAS AND MEDICINAL HERB INFUSIONS. WITH A BEVERAGE TEA, YOU MIGHT
DUNK A TEA BAG IN HOT WATER A FEW TIMES AND THEN DRINK IT. IF YOU'RE PREPARING AN
HERB INFUSION, THE TEA SHOULD STEEP FOR 10 TO 20 MINUTES TO ALLOW THE THERAPEUTIC
PHYTOCHEMICALS TO PASS OUT OF THE HERB AND INTO THE WATER.
TO MAKE A GOOD CUP OF MEDICINAL TEA, HERE'S A GOOD RULE OF THUMB. START WITH
BOILING WATER AND STEEP YOUR MEDICINAL HERBS UNTIL THE WATER IS COOL. IF YOU LIKE
TO DRINK IT HOT, REHEAT THE TEA GENTLY.
DECOCTIONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, INVOLVE PUTTING HERBAL MATERIAL IN THE WATER,
THEN BOILING OR SIMMERING FOR 10 TO 20 MINUTES. INFUSIONS WORK BEST FOR LEAF AND
FLOWER MATERIAL BECAUSE THEY USUALLY YIELD THEIR PHYTOCHEMICALS MORE EASILY.
THE DECOCTION METHOD, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS TYPICALLY USED FOR ROOT AND TWIG MATERIAL BECAUSE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT MEDICINAL PHYTOCHEMICALS FROM THEM.
THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, I INCLUDE SUGGESTIONS FOR AMOUNTS OF HERBS TO BE USED
IN INFUSIONS AND DECOCTIONS. BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I MAKE MY OWN HERB TEAS
THE SAME WAY I COOK—A LITTLE OF THIS, A HANDFUL OF THAT. IN SUMMER I CRUISE MY
GARDEN, GRABBING WHICHEVER AROMATIC HERBS I PASS—SOMETIMES MORE THAN A
DOZEN—TAKING BIGGER PORTIONS OF THE DELICATE-SMELLING HERBS AND SMALLER PORTIONS OF THE COARSE-SCENTED HERBS LIKE DITTANY, HORSEBALM AND THYME. LIKE MY
SOUPS AND SALADS, NO TWO OF MY HERB TEAS ARE EXACDY THE SAME.
SUGGESTIONS AND SAFETY
WHAT I'M LEADING UP TO IS THIS: USE THE SUGGESTIONS IN THIS BOOK AS JUST
THAT—SUGGESTIONS. I'VE CONCENTRATED MOSTLY ON HERBS THAT ARE SAFE EVEN IN
AMOUNTS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN THOSE SUGGESTED IN THE RECIPES, SO DON'T FEEL
CONCERNED IF YOU USE A BIT MORE OR LESS THAN THE RECIPE SUGGESTS. (WHEN EXACT
DOSAGES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, I NOTE THAT. AND WHENEVER ANY PRECAUTIONS
ARE NEEDED, I NOTE THAT AS WELL.)
IF THERE IS NO RECIPE FOR A SPECIFIC HERB, TRY MAKING AN INFUSION OR DECOCTION
WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF PLANT MATERIAL. THEN TINKER WITH THE AMOUNTS TO SUIT
YOUR PERSONAL NEEDS. YOU CAN'T EXPECT ALL MEDICINAL TEAS TO TASTE GOOD; SOME OF
THEM ARE QUITE BITTER. BUT IF YOU LIKE THE TASTE AND WANT A STRONGER TEA, IT'S OKAY
TO USE A LITTLE MORE OF THE HERB NEXT TIME AROUND. I MASK UNPLEASANT TASTES WITH
POWDERED OR REAL LEMONADE. THE ACIDITY MAY EVEN EXTRACT MORE OF CERTAIN MEDICINAL CHEMICALS.
18
USING THE GREEN PHARMACY
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THESE HERBS ARE MEDICINE. YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW YOUR BODY RESPONDS TO THE HERB AND ADJUST YOUR DOSE ACCORDINGLY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO RELAX AND END UP FEELING OVERLY
SEDATED, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'LL WANT TO MAKE A WEAKER TEA THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
USING THAT PARTICULAR HERB. OUR PERSONAL CHEMISTRIES MAY BE JUST AS VARIABLE AS
THE HERBS'.
AS FOR FREQUENCY, I TYPICALLY SUGGEST ONE TO THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY. AGAIN,
THESE ARE MERELY SUGGESTIONS. IN GENERAL, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND MUCH MORE
THAN FOUR CUPS OF MOST HERBAL TEAS PER DAY.
TINCTURES ANA VINEGARS
CLASSICALLY, A TINCTURE IS MADE BY STEEPING HERB MATERIAL IN DRINKABLE ALCOHOL, SUCH AS ETHYL ALCOHOL (ETHANOL). MY PERSONAL FAVORITE WHEN I'M CREATING
MY OWN TINCTURES IS CHEAP VODKA. IT WORKS JUST FINE.
THE ALCOHOL EXTRACTS A GREAT DEAL OF THE MEDICINAL ESSENCE OF THE HERB.
TINCTURES HAVE LONGER SHELF LIVES THAN DRIED HERBS OR CAPSULES.
YOU CAN BUY READY-MADE TINCTURES AT MOST PLACES THAT SELL HERBS. YOU CAN
ALSO MAKE YOUR OWN QUITE EASILY.
TO MAKE A TINCTURE, YOU CAN USE ANYTHING FROM 40-PROOF ALCOHOL TO ALMOST
200-PROOF, WHICH TRANSLATES AS ANYTHING FROM 20 PERCENT ALCOHOL TO ALMOST PURE
ALCOHOL. MOST HERBALISTS SUGGEST TWO OUNCES OF DRIED HERB (OR A LOOSE HANDFUL OF
FRESH HERB) PER PINT OF ALCOHOL. ALLOW YOUR HERB-ALCOHOL MIXTURE TO STAND FOR
ABOUT A WEEK, SHAKING IT OCCASIONALLY. THEN STRAIN IT. DISCARD THE PLANT MATERIAL (PREFERABLY IN THE COMPOST PILE) AND STORE THE TINCTURE IN A BOTTLE WITH A
DROPPER LID.
TINCTURE DOSAGES CAN RUN ANYWHERE FROM 5 TO 50 DROPS OR FROM A FRACTION OF
A DROPPERFUL TO SEVERAL DROPPERFULS. SOMETIMES THEY'RE EVEN MEASURED IN TEASPOONS OR TABLESPOONS. I USUALLY ADD TINCTURES TO BEVERAGE HERBAL TEAS OR TO
JUICES.
ONE ADVANTAGE OF BUYING A TINCTURE IS THAT APPROPRIATE DOSAGES ARE GENERALLY INDICATED ON THE LABEL.
WHILE ALCOHOL IS A GREAT PRESERVATIVE, WE WANT TO PICKLE THE HERB, NOT THE
CONSUMER. ONE NONALCOHOLIC OPTION THAT'S OFTEN AVAILABLE THESE DAYS IS GLYCERIDES, TINCTURES THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED USING GLYCERIN RATHER THAN ALCOHOL.
THESE ARE NICE OPTIONS FOR INFANTS OR FOR RECOVERING ALCOHOLICS WHO WISH TO
AVOID ALCOHOL IN ANY FORM.
HERBAL VINEGARS ARE ANOTHER GOOD OPTION, AND YOU CAN EVEN MAKE YOUR
OWN. TO DO THIS, SIMPLY STEEP YOUR HERBS IN VINEGAR RATHER THAN ALCOHOL. THE
19
YOUR GUIDE TO THE GREEN PHARMACY
SAME RATIOS MIGHT BE USED: ONE PINT OF VINEGAR FOR EVERY ONE TO TWO OUNCES OF
DRIED HERB OR LOOSE HANDFUL OF FRESH HERB.
YOU CAN USE MANY HERBAL VINEGARS STRAIGHT AS SALAD DRESSINGS, WHICH CAN
BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT. HERBAL VINEGARS CAN ALSO
BE ADDED TO SOUPS OR COOKED VEGETABLES.
USING POULTICES ANA COMPRESSES
A POULTICE IS A WAD OF CHOPPED, FRESH (OR DRIED BUT REMOISTENED) PLANT MATERIAL THAT IS APPLIED DIRECTLY TO A WOUND OR INFECTION ON THE SKIN AND USUALLY
HELD IN PLACE BY A WET DRESSING THAT IS COVERED BY A BANDAGE.
IT'S BEST TO SOFTEN THE HERB FIRST TO COAX OUT MORE OF THE MEDICINAL PHYTOCHEMICALS. YOU CAN DO THIS BY BOILING, STEAMING, CHEWING OR POUNDING IT. THEN
SHAPE THE MATERIAL INTO A SMALL, COIN-SIZE WAD THAT CAN LIE FLAT AGAINST THE WOUND.
MANY HERBALISTS RECOMMEND MIXING ONE PART HERB WITH THREE PARTS WATER, ALCOHOL
OR VINEGAR THICKENED WITH FLOUR TO MAKE THE POULTICE EASIER TO HANDLE AND APPLY.
IN A PINCH, YOU CAN SIMPLY BALL UP SOME WHOLE LEAF AND USE THAT.
POULTICES WORK PRIMARILY AT THE APPLICATION SITE, TYPICALLY PREVENTING INFECTION AND HASTENING THE HEALING OF WOUNDS. BUT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS MANY
COMPOUNDS IN POULTICE PLANTS THAT PASS THROUGH THE SKIN AND HAVE INTERNAL
BENEFITS AS WELL.
COMPRESSES ARE CLEAN CLOTHS THAT HAVE BEEN DIPPED IN AN HERBAL SOLUTION—AN INFUSION, DECOCTION, TINCTURE OR VINEGAR. COMPRESSES CAN BE USED IN
TWO WAYS. YOU MIGHT HOLD A POULTICE IN PLACE WITH A COMPRESS, IN WHICH CASE IT
DOUBLES AS A BANDAGE. OR YOU MIGHT APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE SKIN. THIS TYPE OF
COMPRESS IS ALSO KNOWN AS A FOMENTATION.
SOOTNIRIGF SALVES
MANY COMMERCIAL SALVES CONTAIN HERBS, AND PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET IS TO
BUY A SALVE RATHER THAN MAKE IT. MAKING YOUR OWN SALVES IS A PRETTY MESSY BUSINESS, BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY GO THAT ROUTE IF YOU CHOOSE. MAKING SALVES INVOLVES
MIXING MEDICINAL HERBS WITH WATER, BEESWAX, ANIMAL FAT (LARD OR LANOLIN), VEGETABLE FAT (CORN OIL, CRISCO, MARGARINE OR OLIVE OR SAFFLOWER OIL) AND OTHER INGREDIENTS TO CREATE SPREADABLE LOTIONS.
I CONFESS THAT I'VE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK MIXING UP SALVES. MINE TEND TO BE
EITHER TOO RUNNY OR TOO DRY. BUT OTHER HERBALISTS ARE MUCH BETTER AT IT.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY MAKING A SALVE, START WITH PULVERIZED HERB AND COVER IT
WITH WATER. BOIL OR SIMMER FOR 15 TO 30 MINUTES, THEN LET IT COOL. ADD SOME OIL,
20
USIN G TH E GREE N PHARMAC Y
THEN GENTLY HEAT THE OILY MIXTURE UNTIL THE WATER HAS EVAPORATED, PERHAPS 15
TO 30 MINUTES.
FINALLY, ADD BEESWAX AND/OR A FAT TO GIVE YOUR SALVE THE PROPER CONSISTENCY.
COOL BEFORE USING. A WELL-PREPARED SALVE CAN KEEP FOR UP TO A YEAR. SALVES CAN
BE USED LIKE POULTICES, EXCEPT THAT YOU OFTEN DON'T NEED THE BANDAGE.
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT MAKE SALVES FROM SCRATCH, YOU CAN ALSO SIMPLY ADD
PULVERIZED, SIMMERED HERB MATERIAL TO ANY OF THE COMMERCIAL SKIN OINTMENTS
SOLD IN DRUGSTORES.
HEALING WITH AROMATHERAPY
AROMATHERAPY IS THE TREATMENT OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITH THE AROMATIC ESSENTIAL OILS OF FRAGRANT HERBS. AROMATHERAPISTS OFTEN USE ESSENTIAL OILS FROM THE
MINT FAMILY, WHICH INCLUDES SUCH AROMATHERAPEUTIC SUPERSTARS AS LAVENDER (A
TRANQUILIZER) AND ROSEMARY (A STIMULANT).
THE ESSENTIAL OILS USED IN AROMATHERAPY, WHICH COME IN LITTLE VIALS, ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED. YOU CAN SIMPLY SNIFF DIRECTLY FROM THE VIAL, OR YOU CAN
USE THE OIL FOR MASSAGE.
SINCE THE OILS ARE SO CONCENTRATED, THEY CAN BE IRRITATING TO THE SKIN. IF
YOU'RE USING AN OIL FOR MASSAGE, FIRST DILUTE IT BY ADDING A FEW DROPS TO VEGETABLE OIL OR MASSAGE LOTION. IF YOU DOUBT THAT ESSENTIAL OILS CAN PASS THROUGH
YOUR SKIN, HERE'S AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU TO TRY: MASSAGE A FEW DROPS OF DILUTED
LAVENDER OIL INTO YOUR SKIN. WITHIN A SHORT TIME, YOUR FRIENDS MAY NOTICE THAT
YOU HAVE LAVENDER BREATH WHEN YOU EXHALE.
ANOTHER NICE WAY TO USE ESSENTIAL OILS IS TO ADD A FEW DROPS TO YOUR BATH.
(YOU CAN ALSO USE A HANDFUL OF FRESH OR DRIED HERBS IF YOU CHOOSE.) SINCE MANY
OF THE FRAGRANT COMPOUNDS ARE READILY ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN, THIS IS A PARTICULARLY PLEASANT WAY TO GET YOUR MEDICINE. IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA, FOR EXAMPLE,
I SUGGEST ADDING SEDATIVE LAVENDER AND LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA) TO
YOUR BATH. I BET YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP MORE EASILY AND SLEEP MORE SOUNDLY.
WHATEVER YOU DO, THOUGH, DO NOT INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS. MANY ARE QUITE
TOXIC, AND AS LITTLE AS A HALF-TEASPOON CAN KILL YOU. (A FEW ESSENTIAL OILS CAN BE
TAKEN IN DILUTED FORM, BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN EXPERIMENT WITH
ON YOUR OWN. AN EXPERIENCED HERBAL PRACTITIONER MAY OCCASIONALLY RECOMMEND
INGESTING DILUTED ESSENTIAL OILS.)

AGING
A
S I WRITE THIS, I'M ENTERING THE LATTER HALF OF MY SIXTIES, AND I CONFESS
THAT AGING FRIGHTENS ME.
I WATCHED UNCOMFORTABLY AS MY 101-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER LANGUISHED ALMOST IMMOBILIZED IN THE LAST DECADE OF HER LIFE. I WENT THROUGH THE SAME ANGUISH WITH MY 98-YEAR-OLD MOTHER. I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND MY LAST DECADE
BEDRIDDEN!
AGE FACTORS
BEING A BOTANIST, I HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN HERBS THAT CAN HOLD BACK
THE AGING PROCESS. BUT FM FORCED TO ADMIT THAT I THINK LIFESTYLE CHANGES ARE A
WHOLE LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN HERBS—AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN HORMONE
SUPPLEMENTATION—IN HELPING YOU STAY YOUTHFUL. SO BEFORE I DISCUSS THE MOST
HELPFUL HERBS, I WANT TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC ABOUT THOSE LIFESTYLE CHANGES. THEY
SHOULD FORM THE FOUNDATION OF ANY ANTI-AGING HERBAL TREATMENTS THAT YOU DECIDE
TO TRY.
NOT BEING A DOCTOR, I DON'T PRESCRIBE, BUT I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO SUGGEST THE
FOLLOWING TO MY 30-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER SO SHE COULD HOLD ON MORE TENACIOUSLY TO
HER VIBRANT YOUTH. COME TO THINK OF IT, THIS IS GOOD ADVICE FOR MEN AND WOMEN OF
ANY AGE WHO ARE TRYING TO HOLD BACK THE CLOCK.
DRINK TWO ANTIOXIDANT HERB TEAS A DAY. ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES
THAT NEUTRALIZE FREE RADICALS, NATURALLY OCCURRING OXYGEN MOLECULES THAT DAMAGE
THE BODY AND ARE THOUGHT TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE AGING PROCESS. MOST
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ANTIOXIDANTS, AS DO MANY
HERBS. IF YOU'RE A HEAVY COFFEE DRINKER, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER REPLACING TWO CUPS OF
COFFEE A DAY WITH HERB TEA. GOOD RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT OREGANO, ROSEMARY, BEE
BALM, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA), PEPPERMINT, SAGE, SPEARMINT, SAVORY
AND THYME CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF ANTIOXIDANTS.
EAT AT LEAST ONE BIG SALAD A DAY. YOU CAN USE BOTH WILD GREENS—THINGS
LIKE PURSLANE, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THEM—AND A VARIETY OF DOMESTIC SALAD VEGETABLES, SUCH AS SPINACH AND CHICORY. GREEN LEAVES ARE CHOCK-FULL OF ANTIOXIDANT NUTRIENTS THAT HELP PROTECT YOU FROM HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND OTHER
DEGENERATIVE DISEASES THAT TEND TO COME ON AS WE AGE. USUALLY, THE GREENER THE
LEAF, THE MORE ANTIOXIDANTS IT CONTAINS, SO FILL UP ON THOSE DARK, LEAFY GREENS.
EAT ONE OR TWO BRAZIL NUTS A DAY. THE AVERAGE BRAZIL NUT CONTAINS MORE
7A
AGIN G
THAN THE DAILY VALUE OF THE ANTIOXIDANT MINERAL SELENIUM—70 MICROGRAMS.
EAT A HANDFUL OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS A DAY, ALONG WITH A SPRINKLING OF
OTHER NUTS. AMONG NUTS AND SEEDS, SUNFLOWER SEEDS ARE ONE OF THE BETTER
SOURCES OF VITAMIN E. THEY'RE ALSO CHEAP.
ONE CAUTION, HOWEVER: IF YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR WAISTLINE, DON'T EAT MORE
THAN AN OUNCE OF NUTS A DAY. NUTS ARE HIGH IN FAT.
EAT AT LEAST ONE BROCCOLI SPEAR, CARROT AND CELERY STALK A DAY.
THEY'RE ALL HIGH IN FIBER. BROCCOLI AND CARROTS ARE ALSO HIGH IN BETA-CAROTENE,
THE POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT THAT THE BODY TRANSFORMS INTO VITAMIN A. CELERY IS
HIGH IN APIGENIN, A CHEMICAL THAT EXPANDS (DILATES) THE BLOOD VESSELS AND MAY
HELP PREVENT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
DRINK A FRUIT SMOOTHIE EVERY DAY. TAKE ANY FRUITS THAT APPEAL TO YOU—
APPLES, ORANGES, BANANAS, GRAPEFRUIT, MELONS OR BERRIES—AND RUN THEM THROUGH
A BLENDER. DON'T USE A JUICER, WHICH EXTRACTS JUST THE JUICE BY SEPARATING IT FROM
THE FIBER. LEAVE THE FIBER IN THERE; IT'S GREAT FOR THE DIGESTIVE TRACT. IF YOU LIKE,
ADD SOME NONFAT YOGURT AND CINNAMON. OR MAKE MY STRIVE-FOR-FIVEADE BY
BLENDING ONE DICED APPLE, TWO DICED CARROTS AND DICED SECTIONS OF ONE LIME AND
ONE GRAPEFRUIT WITH SOME WATER AND A LITDE STEVIA. (STEVIA IS AVAILABLE IN MANY
HEALTH FOOD STORES. YOU CAN OPEN A TEA BAG AND USE A PINCH OF THE HERB IN PLACE
OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.)
REPLACE ONE MEAT COURSE A DAY WITH A VEGETARIAN DISH. ONE OF MY
FAVORITES IS GUACAMOLE—MASHED AVOCADO. YOU CAN LACE YOUR GUACAMOLE WITH
ONION, HOT CHILI PEPPERS, GARLIC AND LEMON JUICE AND SPRINKLE IT WITH CHOPPED
NUTS SUCH AS HAZELNUTS, MACADAMIAS, PISTACHIOS, CASHEWS, PEANUTS OR BRAZIL
NUTS. ALL OF THESE NUTS ARE RICH IN MONOUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS, BENEFICIAL FATS
THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART, AMONG OTHER THINGS. (ANYONE WHO IS CARRYING EXTRA
POUNDS, HOWEVER, SHOULD FORGO THE NUTS, WHICH ARE HIGH IN CALORIES.)
USE OLIVE OIL. CORN OIL AND OTHER VEGETABLE OILS ARE POLYUNSATURATED OILS.
OLIVE OIL IS A MONOUNSATURATED OIL. THERE IS A COMPLEX CHEMICAL EXPLANATION
FOR HOW THESE DIFFER, BUT ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THERE'S GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT MONOUNSATURATED OILS ARE A LOT BETTER FOR YOU. IN SALAD DRESSINGS, REPLACE POLYUNSATURATED OILS WITH OLIVE OIL.
EAT A WIDE VARIETY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. ALSO EAT A GOOD SELECTION
OF HERBS, LEGUMES, NUTS AND SPICES. THESE ARE THE FOODS THAT OUR ANCESTORS CONSUMED BACK IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE INVENTION OF BURGERS, HOT DOGS, PIZZA, ICE
CREAM AND ALL THE JUNK WE EAT TODAY. THEY ATE MORE NUTRITIOUSLY THAN WE DO.
MAKE LOVE REGULARLY WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE. THERE'S NO EXPLANATION
NEEDED HERE EXCEPT THAT IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VIGOROUS HALF-HOUR WALK, WELL-PROTECTED FROM SUNLIGHT (ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION).
USE THE TIME TO UNWIND AND COMMUNE WITH THE NATURAL WORLD. CONTEMPLATE THE
MIRACULOUS ECOSYSTEM AROUND YOU AND CONSIDER WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES YOU—
AND IT—TICK. RESPECT, DON'T FEAR, THE MYSTERY OF IT ALL.
I ALSO RECOMMEND SOME LIFESTYLE DON'TS TO GO WITH THE DO'S.
DON'T SMOKE. THIS GOES WITHOUT SAYING.
DON'T DRINK ALCOHOL. IF YOU DO IMBIBE, DON'T HAVE MORE THAN TWO DRINKS
A DAY, AND DON'T DRINK EVERY DAY. GIVE YOUR LIVER A SABBATICAL EVERY NOW AND
THEN. A FEW WEEKS OUT OF EVERY YEAR, DON'T DRINK ANY ALCOHOL OR TAKE ANY MEDICATIONS (OTHER THAN THOSE YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY). YOUR
LIVER HAS TO WORK HARD TO CLEAR ALCOHOL, MEDICATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS FROM YOUR BODY; IT WILL APPRECIATE GETTING A BREATHER.
DON'T SUNBATHE—EVER. YOU PROBABLY GET ENOUGH SUN TO PRODUCE A
HEALTHY AMOUNT OF VITAMIN D WITH MODERATE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES THAT DON'T INVOLVE
ACTIVELY SEEKING THE SUN.
DON'T TAKE LIFE OR DEATH TOO SERIOUSLY. THAT CAN AGE OR KILL YOU.
DON'T BE A DIETARY FADDIST. IT'S NEVER A GOOD IDEA TO BASE YOUR DIET ON
JUST A COUPLE OF FOODS, EVEN FRUITS OR CARROTS. VARY YOUR DIET, YOUR FOOD SOURCES,
YOUR MODE OF PREPARATION AND EVEN THE COMPANY YOU KEEP WHEN YOU DINE.
DON'T LET INDUSTRY OUTVOTE THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS. IF YOU DO, WE'LL ALL
PAY THE PRICE EVENTUALLY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR AGING
I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE LIFESTYLE CHANGES ARE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN
HERBS. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SEVERAL HERBS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT FOR
HOLDING BACK THE RAVAGES OF AGE.
VVV GINKGO (GINKGO BUOBA). THIS IS THE MOST INTRIGUING HERB FOR COUNTERACTING THE NEUROLOGICAL SLINGS AND ARROWS OF AGING. THERE'S GOOD EUROPEAN
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT IT HELPS IMPROVE BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN. SOME STUDIES
SUGGEST THAT GINKGO HELPS PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER FORMS OF
DEMENTIA BECOME MORE ALERT AND SOCIABLE, THINK MORE CLEARLY, FEEL BETTER AND
REMEMBER MORE. IN EUROPE, MANY OLDER PEOPLE REGULARLY TAKE A STANDARDIZED
EXTRACT OF THIS HERB TO HELP KEEP THEM MENTALLY FIT.
GINKGO'S ABILITY TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO OFFER
A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AGING. IT IMPROVES ALERTNESS, MEMORY
AND THE ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE, IT ELEVATES MOOD, AND IT RELIEVES TINNITUS (RINGING
IN THE EARS), DIZZINESS AND ANXIETY.
HUGE, STATELY GINKGO TREES GROW ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT TAKES BAR26
AGIN G
GINKGO
FOR MEDICINAL
PURPOSES, THE
LEAVES OF THE
GINKGO TREE ARE
MADE INTO
STANDARDIZED
EXTRACTS.
RELS OF LEAVES TO PRODUCE A FEW DAYS' WORTH OF USABLE EXTRACT.
THE BEST WAY TO USE THIS HERB IS TO BUY A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT OR CAPSULES AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB OUTLET. STILL, I
CONFESS TO BLENDING A FEW LEAVES INTO MY FRUIT SMOOTHIES
WITH NO OBVIOUS ILL EFFECTS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO
ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY
CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
VV AMERICAN GINSENG (PANAX QUINQUEFOLIUS)
AND ASIAN GINSENG (P, GINSENG). THE CHINESE AND KOREANS REVERE GINSENG AS THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. THEY REGARD
THIS HERB AS A TONIC FOR THE ELDERLY BECAUSE IT TONES THE SKIN
AND MUSCLES, HELPS IMPROVE APPETITE AND DIGESTION AND RESTORES DEPLETED SEXUAL ENERGY.
WHILE ON A TRIP TO CHINA IN 1978 FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING GINSENG, I HAD ONE ELDERLY CHINESE
MAN TELL ME NOT TO WASTE THIS HERB ON YOUNG PEOPLE. HE
SAID I SHOULD SAVE IT FOR OLD AGE, WHEN IT WOULD MAKE ME
FEEL YOUNG AGAIN. I'M ALMOST READY. THE HOUSE IS PAID OFF, AND I HAVE FIVE
SPECIES OF GINSENG GROWING ON MY SIX-ACRE FARMETTE.
GINSENG IS SLOWLY GAINING SUPPORTERS AMONG AMERICAN PHYSICIANS. ONE
BIG BOOSTER IS ANDREW WEIL, M.D., HERB ADVOCATE, PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE. HE FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDS GINSENG TO HELP STRENGTHEN PEOPLE
WHO ARE WEAKENED BY OLD AGE OR CHRONIC ILLNESS.
V \ ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS HERB IS NATIVE TO
OUR OWN GREAT PLAINS, AND IT'S AMERICA'S BEST HERBAL IMMUNE BOOSTER. I'VE BEEN
VERY IMPRESSED WITH GERMAN RESEARCH SHOWING THAT ITS ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION
HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT COLDS, FLU AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER VIRAL, BACTERIAL AND
FUNGAL INFECTIONS.
W EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THE SEEDS OF THIS LOVELY
NIGHT-FLOWERING BLOSSOM CONTAIN AN OIL RICH IN GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA), A
SUBSTANCE THAT HAS EXCITED A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH INTEREST IN THE PAST FEW
YEARS. GLA SEEMS TO HELP ALLEVIATE SEVERAL CONDITIONS: PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME
(PMS); ECZEMA, A CHRONIC SKIN CONDITION THAT CAUSES ITCHY, RED, SCALY PATCHES;
DIABETIC POLYNEUROPATHY, A TYPE OF NERVE DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES; AND
PERHAPS EVEN ALCOHOLISM AND OBESITY. IT ALSO SHOWS PROMISE AGAINST AMERICA'S
BIGGEST KILLERS, HEART DISEASE AND CANCER.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). BESIDES BEING A POTENT ANTIBIOTIC AND
27
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ANTIVIRAL HERB, GARLIC REDUCES HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AND LOWERS HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE.
I ALSO READ A FASCINATING JAPANESE STUDY SUGGESTING THAT GARLIC HELPED SLOW
PHYSIOLOGICAL AGING AND AGE-RELATED MEMORY LOSS IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. I
DON'T HANG MY HAT ON A SINGLE STUDY—ESPECIALLY NOT AN ANIMAL STUDY—BUT
SINCE I'M RECOMMENDING GARLIC ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I'D MENTION THIS ONE.
W GOTU KOLA (CENTEUA ASIATICA). GOTU KOLA IS WIDELY USED IN INDIA TO
IMPROVE MEMORY AND EXTEND LONGEVITY. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, ADD A FRESH LEAF OR
TWO OR A TEASPOON OR SO OF DRIED HERB TO BEVERAGE TEAS. YOU CAN ALSO ADD A FEW
FRESH LEAVES TO SALADS.
VV MILK THISTLE (SILYBUM MARIANUM). THIS IS MY FAVORITE LIVER
PROTECTOR. THE LIVER PROCESSES DRUGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS, SO IT'S UNDER CONSTANT ASSAULT IN THE MODEM WORLD. ANYONE WHO DRINKS ALCOHOL, TAKES DRUGS (LEGAL
OR ILLICIT) OR COMES IN CONTACT WITH ANY POLLUTANTS MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THIS HERB.
VV PEPPERMINT {MENTHA PIPERITA). THANK GOODNESS FOR PEPPERMINT'S
ABILITY TO RELIEVE INDIGESTION AND GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS. IT ALSO CONTAINS ANTIOXIDANTS THAT HELP PREVENT CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND OTHER DISEASES ASSOCIATED WITH AGING.
VV PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). EXCEPTIONALLY RICH IN ANTIOXIDANTS,
PURSLANE IS THE TOP HERB THAT POPS UP IN MY DATABASE WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR COMBINATIONS OF THE ANTIOXIDANT VITAMINS A, C AND E. IT'S ALSO RICH IN THE COMPOUND
GLUTATHIONE, WHICH IS BOTH A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT AND AN IMMUNE
SYSTEM BOOSTER.
SPEAKING OF GLUTATHIONE, OTHER VEGETABLES RICH IN
THIS ANTI-AGING COMPOUND INCLUDE ASPARAGUS, BROCCOLI,
CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER, POTATOES AND TOMATOES. FRUITS WITH
THIS ANTIOXIDANT INCLUDE AVOCADOS, GRAPEFRUIT, ORANGES,
PEACHES AND WATERMELON.
^ ^ THYME (THYMUS VULGARIS). THYME IS ANOTHER
GOOD SOURCE OF BENEFICIAL ANTI-AGING CHEMICALS. YOU CAN
EVEN BENEFIT FROM SOAKING IN IT. I WOULD REGULARLY ADD A
HANDFUL OF THE DRIED HERB TO HOT BATHS IF I WERE A TUB TYPE
INSTEAD OF A SHOWER TYPE. THYME'S AROMATIC OIL HELPS
SOOTHE MY BACK SPASMS.
VV WILLOW (SALIX) VARIOUS SPECIES). THE BARK OF
THIS TREE WAS THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF ASPIRIN. IT CAN BE
MADE INTO A TEA THAT RELIEVES HEADACHE, TOOTHACHE,
ARTHRITIS AND OTHER PAINFUL CONDITIONS. IT ALSO HELPS PREVENT HEART ATTACK, STROKE AND COLORECTAL CANCER.
THYME
BEST
KNOWN AS A
FOOD
FLAVORING,
THYME CONTAINS
CHEMICALS WITH
HEATING PROPERTIES.
28
ALLERGIES
V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). THIS POPULAR HERB IS A MILD TRANQUILIZER WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CONSTITUENTS THAT MIGHT HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS.
V HORSETAIL (EQUISETUM ARVENSE). WITH AGE AND DECLINING HORMONAL
ACTIVITY, LEVELS OF THE MINERAL SILICON DECREASE IN THE ARTERIES AND SKIN. SILICON
ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN THE REPAIR OF BONE, CARTILAGE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUES. HORSETAIL, A GOOD HERBAL SOURCE OF SILICON, IS A LONGTIME FOLK REMEDY FOR FRACTURES,
TORN LIGAMENTS AND RELATED INJURIES. I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS HERB, BUT SINCE I'M
NOT YET CONVINCED THAT IT HAS ALL THE ANTI-AGING VALUE THAT SOME SOURCES SUGGEST, I TAKE IT ONLY RARELY. IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT, YOU CAN DO SO IN CONSULTATION
WITH A HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER.
ALLERGIES
I
F YOU'VE EVER HAD A SNEEZING FIT IN THE MIDST OF HOUSECLEANING, YOU PROBABLY BLAMED IT ON ALL THAT STIRRED-UP DUST. BUT AN ALLERGIST OR IMMUNOLOGIST WOULD DISAGREE. IT'S NOT THE DUST THAT CAUSES THE SNEEZING, THEY'VE FOUND.
IT'S YOUR BODY'S REACTION, AND THE CHEMICALS IT RELEASES, THAT PROMPT YOUR
SNEEZING. IT'S TRUE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE SENSITIVE THAN OTHERS TO THE DUST,
DUST MITES AND MOLD SPORES THAT FLOAT THROUGH THE AIR. BUT THAT JUST MEANS THAT
THEIR BODIES GO A LITTLE OVERBOARD IN THE PROCESS OF REACTING TO THE FREE-FLOATING
INVADERS.
STRESS, DUST AND ANNOYANCE
ALLERGIES ARE ABNORMAL REACTIONS TO EVERYDAY SUBSTANCES. THEY ARE CAUSED
BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM'S OVERREACTION TO HISTAMINE, A CHEMICAL THAT THE BODY
RELEASES TO FIGHT MICROBIAL INVADERS. BUT IN ALLERGIES, THE INVADERS ARE NOT
VIRUSES OR BACTERIA. THEY ARE HARMLESS SUBSTANCES: POLLENS, DUST, MOLD SPORES
OR HARMLESS MICROSCOPIC BUGS CALLED DUST MITES THAT LIVE IN CARPETS, CLOTHING
AND BEDDING.
HAY FEVER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ALLERGIES, IS TRIGGERED BY POLLENS. RAGWEED POLLEN REPORTEDLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF CASES OF HAY FEVER IN
THE UNITED STATES. SOME 25 TO 30 MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER FROM HAY FEVER
EVERY YEAR. ANOTHER 12 MILLION ARE ALLERGIC TO THINGS OTHER THAN POLLEN (BEE
STINGS OR CERTAIN FOODS OR DRUGS).

ALLERGY EMERGENCY
WRITING ABOUT HERBAL TREATMENTS FOR ALLERGIES REMINDS ME OF A WOMAN I MET IN THE EARLY
1970S. SHE WAS AN ATTRACTIVE, ENERGETIC YOUNG LADY FROM THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. SHE CAME OUT TO MY OFFICE IN BELTSVILLE, MARYLAND, ONE DECEMBER
TO BORROW A LENGTHY REPORT THAT I'D PREPARED ON THE POPPY PLANT. WE DISCUSSED COLLABORATING ON A REVISED VERSION OF THE REPORT AND THEN PARTED, ASSUMING THAT WE'D TALK
AGAIN AFTER CHRISTMAS. BUT I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.
THIS WOMAN, I LATER LEARNED, DIED FROM A VERY RARE ALLERGIC REACTION TO PEANUTS. (ON
AVERAGE, TWO PEOPLE EACH YEAR ARE KNOWN TO DIE FROM THIS ALLERGY.) KNOWING THAT SHE WAS
DEATHLY ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS, THE WOMAN HAD ALWAYS SHUNNED THEM. BUT, I WAS TOLD, SHE INADVERTENTLY ATE ONE CHRISTMAS COOKIE THAT CONTAINED POWDERED PEANUTS, AND THAT WAS
ENOUGH TO KILL HER.
SUCH FATAL REACTIONS ARE NOT WHAT MOST OF US REFER TO WHEN WE SAY "ALLERGY." MORE
OFTEN, ALLERGIC REACTIONS ARE MERELY ANNOYING. THEY INVOLVE THINGS LIKE SNEEZING, ITCHING,
WATERY EYES AND HIVES.
ALLERGIC REACTIONS THAT ARE LIFE-THREATENING, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE IN A CLASS BY
THEMSELVES. THE MEDICAL NAME FOR THIS KIND OF ALLERGIC REACTION IS ANAPHYLAXIS.
IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION IS A FIRECRACKER, THEN ANAPHYLAXIS IS A STICK OF DYNAMITE.
EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT AN ANAPHYLATIC ALLERGIC REACTION IS, BECAUSE A
PERSON WHO IS HAVING THIS KIND OF REACTION MUST RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR.
ANAPHYLAXIS DEVELOPS SUDDENLY SHORTLY AFTER INGESTION OF A SUBSTANCE THAT A
PERSON IS EXTREMELY ALLERGIC TO. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DIFFICULTY BREATHING, COLLAPSE AND
CONVULSIONS. IF THESE DEVELOP, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, AND SAY "SUSPECTED ANAPHYLAXIS."
IN FACT, IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE SEVERELY ALLERGIC, YOU MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS INJECTABLE
EPINEPHRINE WITH YOUR DOCTOR. SHE MIGHT AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO
HAVE THIS EMERGENCY TREATMENT ON HAND.
. • ; J
STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR ALLERGIES INVOLVES TAKING DECONGESTANTS
AND ANTIHISTAMINES. DECONGESTANTS OPEN CLOGGED NASAL PASSAGES AND HAVE
DRYING ACTION. ANTIHISTAMINES SUPPRESS THE BODY'S RELEASE OF HISTAMINE.
IN SEVERE CASES, DOCTORS PRESCRIBE IMMUNOTHERAPY, POPULARLY KNOWN AS ALLERGY SHOTS. THE SHOTS CONTAIN TINY QUANTITIES OF THE SUBSTANCES (ALLERGENS) TO
WHICH THE PERSON IS SENSITIVE. OVER TIME, WITH EXPOSURE TO SLOWLY INCREASING
AMOUNTS OF ALLERGEN, THE BODY BECOMES DESENSITIZED AND STOPS REACTING WITH
ALLERGY SYMPTOMS.
30
ALLERGIES
DECONGESTANTS, ANTIHISTAMINES AND ALLERGY SHOTS WORK WELL FOR SOME
PEOPLE, BUT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THEM. THESE APPROACHES TREAT ONLY THE SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIES, NOT THE CAUSE, WHICH IS A CONFUSED IMMUNE SYSTEM.
DECONGESTANTS CAN CAUSE INSOMNIA AND RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE. ANTIHISTAMINES MAY CAUSE DROWSINESS. BOTH MAY LOSE EFFECTIVENESS AFTER A WHILE. THEY
ALSO INTERFERE WITH—AND ACCORDING TO SOME EXPERTS, WEAKEN—THE IMMUNE
SYSTEM. ALLERGY SHOTS DON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE, AND WHEN THEY DO, THEY OFTEN
INVOLVE YEARS OF TREATMENT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ALLERGIES
YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT I PREFER "GREENER," MORE NATURAL APPROACHES. SOME OF THESE APPROACHES HELP WITH ALLERGY SYMPTOMS. HERE ARE THE
HELPFUL HERBS.
^ ^ GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A, CEPA). THESE MAY BE BENEFICIAL BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF COMPOUNDS SUCH AS QUERCETIN
FOUND IN THESE PLANTS. THESE COMPOUNDS RETARD INFLAMMATORY REACTIONS. IF YOU
HAVE ALLERGIES, I'D SUGGEST ADDING GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF THESE FOODS TO YOUR
MENU.
W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). THE LEAF EXTRACT OF THE STATELY GINKGO TREE
CONTAINS SEVERAL UNIQUE SUBSTANCES (GINKGOLIDES) THAT INTERFERE WITH THE ACTION
OF A CHEMICAL THAT THE BODY PRODUCES—PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR, OR PAF. PAF
PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TRIGGERING ALLERGIES, ASTHMA AND INFLAMMATION. MY OWN ALLERGIES HAVE NEVER BEEN SEVERE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME REACH FOR GINKGO, BUT IF THEY
GOT BAD, I WOULD PROBABLY TRY IT. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO
MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
W STINGING NETTLE (VRTICA DIOICA). SOME GOOD RESEARCH SHOWS THAT
NETTLE PREPARATIONS MAY EFFECTIVELY TREAT ALLERGIC NASAL SYMPTOMS. EVERY SPRING,
VISITORS TO MY HERB GARDEN DIG UP ROOTS FROM MY NETTLE PATCH TO TREAT THEIR HAY
FEVER. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT NETTLE DOES, IN FACT, HELP RELIEVE ALLERGY
SYMPTOMS. FOR CENTURIES, CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE USED THIS HERB TO
TREAT NASAL AND RESPIRATORY TROUBLES: COUGHS, RUNNY NOSE, CHEST CONGESTION,
ASTHMA, WHOOPING COUGH AND EVEN TUBERCULOSIS. AT A COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
WORKSHOP ON BOTANICAL MEDICINE FOR PHYSICIANS, HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL,
M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND
AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, SAID THAT HE KNEW OF NOTHING SO
DRAMATIC AS THE ALLERGY (HAY FEVER) RELIEF AFFORDED BY FREEZE-DRIED NETTLE
LEAVES.
31
CHOOSIN G TH E HERBS THA T HEA L
V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). AROMATHERAPISTS, ESPECIALLY IN
EUROPE, RECOMMEND MASSAGING WITH CAMOMILE PREPARATIONS TO TREAT SKIN ALLERGIES SUCH AS HIVES AND ITCHING. THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO ME. THERE ARE
COMPOUNDS IN THIS HERB THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-ALLERGIC PROPERTIES. YOU CAN BUY CAMOMILE ESSENTIAL OIL AND CREAMS CONTAINING
CAMOMILE AT MANY NATURAL FOOD STORES.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE OIL AND HERBAL PRODUCTS
CAUTIOUSLY, HOWEVER. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME
PEOPLE, IT MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. (DOCUMENTED CASES ARE EXTREMELY
RARE.) THE FIRST TIME YOU USE CAMOMILE, WATCH YOUR REACTION. IF IT SEEMS TO HELP,
GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE ITCHING WORSE, SIMPLY DISCONTINUE USE. (FOR OTHER HERBS THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE THE ITCH ASSOCIATED WITH SKIN
ALLERGIES, SEE HIVES ON PAGE 261.)
"V FEVERFEW (TANACETUM PARTHENIUM). FEVERFEW IS BEST KNOWN THESE
DAYS FOR ITS PROVEN EFFECTIVENESS IN TREATING MIGRAINE HEADACHES. BUT THIS HERB
MAY ALSO HELP RELIEVE ALLERGIES. IF YOU USE IT, TAKE CAPSULES OR SOME OTHER COMMERCIAL PREPARATION. I'VE TASTED THE LEAVES, AND THE EXPERIENCE IS NOT PLEASANT.
IF I DEVELOPED SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING ALLERGY SYMPTOMS AND HAD NO OTHER MEDICATION, I WOULD LIKELY USE FEVERFEW.
PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD NOT TAKE FEVERFEW BECAUSE OF A REMOTE POSSIBILITY
THAT IT MIGHT TRIGGER MISCARRIAGE. AND WOMEN WHO ARE NURSING SHOULD NOT USE IT
BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PASSING THE HERB TO INFANTS VIA MILK. FINALLY, LONGTERM USERS OFTEN REPORT A MILD TRANQUILIZING OR SEDATIVE EFFECT, WHICH MAY BE
WELCOME OR UNWELCOME, DEPENDING ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT.
V HORSERADISH (AMORACIA RUSTIC ANA). THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A BITE OF
FRESH HORSERADISH (OR A SPOONFUL OF PREPARED HORSERADISH DRESSING) TO CLEAR THE
SINUSES. OR IF YOU LIKE JAPANESE FOOD, TRY JAPANESE HORSERADISH, CALLED WASABI.
THIS RECOMMENDATION COMES FROM THE GOOD BOOK, NATURAL HEALTH SECRETS FROM
AROUND THE WORLD BY GLENN W. GEELHOED, M.D., PROFESSOR OF SURGERY AT GEORGE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND ROBERT D. WILLIX, M.D., A CARDIAC SURGEON AND SPORTS MEDICINE SPECIALIST IN BOCA RATON, FLORIDA. THEY REPORT THAT "A DAILY DOSAGE IS NECESSARY ONLY UNTIL THE SYMPTOMS OF YOUR ALLERGY
SUBSIDE. THEREAFTER, YOU NEED ONLY A FEW TEASPOONS OF HORSERADISH EACH MONTH
TO PREVENT ANOTHER ALLERGY ATTACK."
I ENJOY HORSERADISH AS A SPICE, SO I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO TRY IT FOR ALLERGY
RELIEF. YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WHILE HORSERADISH IS HOT, WASABI IS EVEN HOTTER.
IF YOU DON'T ENJOY HOT, SPICY FOOD, YOU'D BEST OPT FOR A DIFFERENT TREATMENT.
V VITAMIN C. NOT TOO LONG AGO, C. LEIGH BROADHURST, PH.D., STOPPED BY
MY OFFICE TO TALK ABOUT ALLERGIES. DR. BROADHURST IS GEOCHEMIST WITH EXPERTISE IN
32
ALTITUD E SICKNES S
NUTRITIONAL MEDICINE. AT THE TIME OF OUR CONVERSATION, HE WAS WORKING FOR THE
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
TO PREVENT AND TREAT ALLERGIES, DR. BROADHURST RECOMMENDS TAKING 1,000
MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C WITH BIOFLAVONOIDS THREE TIMES A DAY. THIS SOUNDS FINE
TO ME. ONE REVIEW OF SOME 40 VITAMIN C STUDIES SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO TOOK
VITAMIN C REGULARLY HAD FEWER ALLERGY PROBLEMS, RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS AND
ASTHMA ATTACKS. VITAMIN C IS A POWERFUL NATURAL ANTIHISTAMINE WITH NO KNOWN
SIDE EFFECTS, EXCEPT DIARRHEA. SOME PEOPLE DEVELOP DIARRHEA AFTER TAKING AS
LITTLE AS 1,200 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C A DAY, BUT THIS IS RARE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO
TRY THIS THERAPY, CUT BACK ON THE AMOUNT OF VITAMIN C IF YOU DEVELOP DIARRHEA.
DON'T CONFINE YOURSELF TO SUPPLEMENTS, EITHER. PLANTS THAT ARE RICH IN
VITAMIN C INCLUDE CHINESE BITTER MELON, BELL PEPPERS, CAYENNE PEPPER, POKEWEED SHOOTS, GUAVA AND WATERCRESS.
ALTITUDE SICKNESS
I
CELEBRATED MY 65TH BIRTHDAY CLIMBING MACHU PICCHU, THE FAMOUS
9,000-FOOT MOUNTAIN IN PERU. AND JUST THE DAY BEFORE THAT, I HAD
CLIMBED ITS STEEPER SISTER PEAK, HUAINU PICCHU. TWO DAYS OF TOUGH CLIMBING
NEARLY TWO MILES ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND I COULD HAVE SUFFERED A BAD BOUT OF ALTITUDE SICKNESS, WHAT PEOPLE IN THE ANDES CALL SOROCHE.
BUT BEFORE BOTH CLIMBS I KNEW THAT I MIGHT DEVELOP THE SYMPTOMS OF ALTITUDE SICKNESS—HEADACHE, THIRST, DIZZINESS, WEAKNESS, HEART PALPITATIONS AND
SHORTNESS OF BREATH. SO I DID WHAT PERUVIAN MOUNTAIN HIKERS HAVE DONE FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS: I HAD A CUP OF MATE DE COCA, OR COCA TEA.
THIS TEA IS PERFECTLY LEGAL IN PERU AND BOLIVIA BUT NOT IN THE UNITED STATES,
BECAUSE THE COCA LEAF (ERYTHROXYLUM COCA) IS THE SOURCE OF COCAINE. COCAINE IS
A HIGHLY PROCESSED DERIVATIVE OF COCA, AND COCA TEA CONTAINS ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF
IT. BUT THERE'S ENOUGH TO ACT AS A STIMULANT, WHICH IS WHY MANY PERUVIANS DRINK
COCA TEA THE WAY MANY OF US DRINK COFFEE. IN FACT, HOTELS IN CUSCO AND LA PAZ
OFFER MATE DE COCA AS A REINVIGORATING REFRESHMENT TO NEW ARRIVALS FROM THE LOWLANDS. AND THEY'RE WELL-AWARE THAT COCA TEA HELPS RELIEVE ALTITUDE SICKNESS.
FOR NATIVE ANDEANS, THE STRAIGHT, UNBREWED COCA LEAF IS THE CLASSICAL ANDEAN ENERGIZER. ON ONE ECOTOUR TO PERU, 27 OF OUR 35 PARTICIPANTS, MYSELF IN33
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ELUDED, EXPERIMENTED WITH CHEWING COCA LEAVES. SOME OF US TRULY SEEMED TO
BE ENERGIZED. SEVERAL PEOPLE COMMENTED THAT I CLIMBED THOSE MOUNTAINS LIKE A
MOUNTAIN GOAT.
OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TRYING TO GET COCA HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES. THE ASSOCIATION WITH COCAINE HAS PERMANENTLY TAINTED ITS LEGALITY AND
REPUTATION, AND GETTING RELIEF FROM ALTITUDE SICKNESS IS NOT WORTH THE PRISON SENTENCE. BUT ANYWHERE THAT COCA IS LEGAL, IT WOULD BE MY TOP THREE-STAR RECOMMENDATION FOR RELIEF OF SOROCHE. I'VE NEVER SUFFERED ANY ILL EFFECTS FROM COCA
TEA, NOR HAVE I SEEN PERUVIANS BECOME GANGSTERS FROM CHEWING COCA LEAVES.
IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SIPPING COCA-COLA OR PEPSI-COLA
TO RELIEVE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. THE COCAINE CAME OUT OF THESE BEVERAGES MANY
YEARS AGO, AND THEY NOW CONTAIN DECOCAINIZED COCA LEAVES. COCA LEAVES STILL
CONTAIN MORE THAN A DOZEN COMPOUNDS THAT ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO COCAINE BUT
ARE COMPLETELY LEGAL, SOME OF WHICH HELP PRODUCE SIMILAR EFFECTS.
WKY GOING HIGK FLATTENS YOU
ALTITUDE SICKNESS DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH THE CHANGE IN ALTITUDE BUT
WITH THE CHANGE IN OXYGEN LEVELS. THE HIGHER YOU GO, THE LESS OXYGEN THERE IS.
AT 8,000 FEET THE ATMOSPHERE CONTAINS HALF THE OXYGEN OF THE AIR AT SEA LEVEL.
IF YOU ASCEND SLOWLY, A FEW THOUSAND FEET A DAY, YOUR BODY WILL PROBABLY ADJUST
TO DECREASED OXYGEN WITH FEW ILL EFFECTS. BUT RAPID ASCENTS—AS IN VIGOROUS
MOUNTAIN CLIMBING—LEAVE YOUR BODY DEPRIVED OF OXYGEN AVAILABILITY, AND THE
RESULT IS ALTITUDE SICKNESS.
A KEY COMPONENT OF ALTITUDE SICKNESS IS DEHYDRATION. AT HIGH ELEVATIONS,
FLUID MOVES OUT OF THE BLOOD AND INTO BODY TISSUES. AS THE BLOOD THICKENS, DEHYDRATION INTERFERES WITH EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION OF NUTRIENTS AND OXYGEN AND IMPEDES THE ELIMINATION OF TOXIC WASTES. THE RESULT IS THE HEADACHE, FATIGUE AND
MALAISE OF ALTITUDE SICKNESS, AS WELL AS EXTREME THIRST.
ONE THING YOU CAN DO TO MINIMIZE OR AVOID ALTITUDE SICKNESS IS TO DRINK
PLENTY OF NONALCOHOLIC FLUIDS BEFORE YOU START YOUR ASCENT AND CONTINUE TAKING
IN LIQUIDS AS YOU CLIMB. PLAIN WATER OR JUICE WORKS WELL. IN THE ANDES, I EAT A
GREAT DEAL OF VEGETABLE SOUP TO GET FLUID AS WELL AS COOKED VEGETABLES (RAW VEGETABLES CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS). I ALSO DRINK HERB TEAS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ALTITUDE SICKNESS
SINCE USING COCA LEAF WON'T BE AN OPTION IN MOST OF YOUR TRAVELS, HERE ARE SOMEOTHER HERBS THAT CAN HELP PREVENT ALTITUDE SICKNESS.
VV GOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUNI). CLOVE OIL IS RICH IN EUGENOL, A COMPOUND
34
ALTITUDE SICKNESS
THAT IS A POTENT BLOOD THINNER (ANTI-AGGREGANT). OTHER HIGH-EUGENOL HERBS IN MY DATABASE, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY, INCLUDE ALLSPICE, BAYRUM LEAF, GALANGAL, CARROT
SEED, SHRUBBY BASIL, CINNAMON, BAY LEAF AND MARJORAM.
MIX SEVERAL OF THE ANTI-AGGREGANT HERBS TOGETHER, AND YOU GET MY ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT TEA:
IN A POT OF BOILING WATER, STEEP CLOVES, ALLSPICE,
BAYLEAF, CELERY SEED, CINNAMON AND MARJORAM AS
AVAILABLE AND TO TASTE. MIX IN, AS AVAILABLE, ANY OR
ALL OF THESE MINTS: BASIL, MOUNTAIN DITTANY, SAVORY AND THYME.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC
CONTAINS AT LEAST NINE COMPOUNDS THAT HELP
THIN THE BLOOD. ITS ANTI-AGGREGANT EFFECT IS
VALUED AS A HEART ATTACK PREVENTIVE, BUT IT ALSO
HELPS SOROCHE SUFFERERS. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE,
OTHER PLANTS THAT HAVE ANTI-AGGREGANT ACTIVITY INCLUDE TOMATOES, DILL AND FENNEL WITH SEVEN BLOODTHINNING COMPOUNDS; ONIONS, HOT PEPPERS AND
SOYBEANS WITH SIX; AND CELERY, CARROTS AND PARSLEY,
EACH WITH FIVE. YOU CAN COOK THEM ALL IN A BIG POT
OF WATER, AND YOU WILL GET WHAT I CALL MY ANTIAGGREGANT SOUP. ENJOYING THESE FOODS IN A VEGETABLE SOUP BEFORE A MOUNTAIN HIKE REALLY CAN HELP
PREVENT ALTITUDE SICKNESS.
W HORSEBALM (MONARDA, VARIOUS SPECIES). MANY MINTS CONTAIN THYMOL,
MENTHOL OR MENTHONE, ALL COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE ANTI-AGGREGANT ACTIVITY. IN MY DATABASE, HORSEBALM WINS AS THE HERB WITH THE MOST. HERE ARE SEVERAL MORE HERBS, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY, THAT CONTAIN THESE HELPFUL INGREDIENTS: THYME, NUDE
MOUNTAIN MINT, WILD BERGAMOT, WINTER SAVORY, MOUNTAIN DITTANY, LEMON MINT, BASIL
AND CALIFORNIA BAY.
W REISHI (GANODERMA LUCIDUM). PEOPLE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF ASIA USE THIS
MUSHROOM THE WAY PERUVIANS USE COCA LEAF. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, REISHI
SIGNIHCANDY REDUCED ALTITUDE SICKNESS SYMPTOMS IN CHINESE WORKERS WHO CLIMBED
TO OVER 15,000 FEET OVER THREE DAYS IN TIBET. THE THEORY IS THAT REISHI INCREASES THE
BODY'S OXYGEN CONSUMPTION.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BUOBA). THIS HERB INCREASES BLOOD FLOW THROUGHOUT THE
BODY, ESPECIALLY TO THE BRAIN. IN ANIMAL STUDIES, RATS FED A GINKGO EXTRACT SHOW DEFINITE INCREASES IN CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND TOLERANCE TO LOW-OXYGEN EFFECTS. THIS
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A POTENTIAL PREVENTIVE AND TREATMENT FOR ALTITUDE SICKNESS. YOU
CLOVE
CLOVES ARE THE DRIED/LOWER
BUDS OF A TROPICAL EVERGREEN TREE.
35
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER
THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
ALZJHEIMER'S DISEASE
N
EARLY A DECADE AGO, FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE APPROACHED ME INDEPENDENTLY IN RAPID SUCCESSION, ASKING IF I COULD FIND THEM SOME CHINESE
CLUB MOSS. THEY HAD ALL HEARD THAT HUPERZINE, A COMPOUND DERIVED FROM THIS
HERB, MIGHT HELP SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. EACH OF THESE
PEOPLE HAD A PARENT WHO HAD THIS DISEASE, AND THEY WERE DESPERATE TO FIND ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP.
I'D NEVER HEARD OF USING CHINESE CLUB MOSS (HUPERZIA SERRATA) FOR
ALZHEIMER'S, SO I DID A LITTLE DIGGING—IN MY DATABASE, NOT IN MY GARDEN—AND
LEARNED THAT HUPERZIA IS AN ALTERNATE NAME FOR SOME OF THE LYCOPODIUM CLUB
MOSSES, INCLUDING ONE THAT GROWS AROUND MY HERBAL VINEYARD IN MARYLAND.
MOSS COMPOUNDS TOR THE BRAIN
I DIMLY RECALLED THAT AN INDIAN TRIBE HAD EATEN LYCOPODIUM, AND SURE
ENOUGH, AFTER A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH I FOUND THAT IT WAS THE CHIPPEWA TRIBE OF
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. I SAMPLED SOME OF THE CLUB MOSS GROWING IN MY
GARDEN AND FOUND IT RATHER UNAPPETIZING. BUT AS MY RESEARCH CONTINUED, I CAME
ACROSS SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION: THE TWO SPECIES OF CLUB MOSS SOUGHT BY
THE CHIPPEWA CONTAINED HUPERZINE.
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT HUPERZINE INHIBITS THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE, A BRAIN CHEMICAL (NEUROTRANSMITTER) THAT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN COGNITION
AND REASONING. PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S OFTEN HAVE AN ACETYLCHOLINE DEFICIENCY.
IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS DEFICIENCY CAUSES THE DISEASE OR RESULTS FROM IT.
BUT ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCHERS ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING TREATMENTS THAT EITHER PREVENT THE CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE OR ADD ITS PRECURSOR, CHOLINE, TO
BRAIN TISSUES. IT WOULD SEEM THAT ANYTHING THAT BOOSTS ACETYLCHOLINE IN THE
BRAIN, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF HERBS, IS CURRENTLY OUR BEST APPROACH TO DEALING
WITH THIS DISEASE.
36
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THE BRAIN DRAIN
ALZHEIMER'S IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF MENTAL DETERIORATION AS PEOPLE AGE.
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING ESTIMATES THAT ALZHEIMER'S AFFECTS FOUR MILLION
AMERICANS. IT STRIKES ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF PEOPLE OVER 65 AND ABOUT HALF OF
THOSE WHO LIVE BEYOND 85.
UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, THERE WAS NO WAY TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S. THEN
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVED TACRINE HYDROCHLORIDE
(COGNEX), A MEDICATION THAT REPORTEDLY SLOWS PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE BY PRESERVING ACETYLCHOLINE IN THE BRAIN. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DRUG IS THAT IT IS TOXIC
TO THE LIVER, WITH A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR CAUSING LIVER DAMAGE.
OTHER DRUGS ARE IN THE PIPELINE. AS USUAL, THEY ARE SYNTHETICS. AND AS
USUAL, THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE FDA SEEM TO BE OVERLOOKING SOME
PROMISING HERBAL ALTERNATIVES, NAMELY ALL OF THE HERBS CONTAINING COMPOUNDS
THAT PREVENT THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
FORTUNATELY, ALONG WITH CLUB MOSS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HERBS THAT
SHOW PROMISE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE.
VVV HORSEBALM {MONARDA, VARIOUS SPECIES). HORSE BALM CONTAINS THE
BENEFICIAL COMPOUND CARVACROL, WHICH AUSTRIAN SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED
HELPS PREVENT THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE. HORSEBALM ALSO CONTAINS
THYMOL, WHICH ALSO PREVENTS THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE.
SOME COMPOUNDS IN HORSEBALM APPARENTLY CAN CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER. NORMALLY YOUR BODY'S PROTECTIVE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER HELPS PREVENT HARMFUL
SUBSTANCES IN THE BLOOD FROM REACHING THE TISSUES OF THE BRAIN. BUT BECAUSE
THIS BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER SOMETIMES WORKS TOO WELL, IT CAN ALSO PREVENT HELPFUL
MEDICINES FROM REACHING THE BRAIN. THE HORSEBALM COMPOUNDS SEEM TO CROSS
THAT GREAT DIVIDE, WHICH MEANS IT MIGHT HAVE SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS EVEN IF YOU
USE IT AS A SHAMPOO OR SKIN LOTION.
THAT BEING SO, I'D BE WILLING TO WAGER MY HEAD OF HAIR, IF NOT MY BRAIN, THAT A
HORSEBALM SHAMPOO MIGHT WORK NEARLY AS WELL AS FDA-APPROVED TACRINE HYDROCHLORIDE. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SAFER, EASIER ON THE LIVER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BUY SHAMPOO THAT CONTAINS HORSEBALM, BUT IT'S EASY
TO MAKE YOUR OWN. SIMPLY ADD SEVERAL DROPPERFULS OF HORSEBALM TINCTURE TO
YOUR FAVORITE HERBAL SHAMPOO.
VVV ROSEMARY {ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT OXIDATIVE DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIGHLY REACTIVE (FREE RADICAL) OXYGEN MOLECULES IN THE
BODY PLAYS A ROLE IN ALZHEIMER'S. IF THAT'S SO, ROSEMARY SHOULD HELP. IT CONTAINS
37
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
A COUPLE OF DOZEN ANTIOXIDANTS—THAT IS, COMPOUNDS THAT HELP MOP UP FREE RADICALS. AMONG THE ANTIOXIDANTS IS A PARTICULARLY POTENT ONE, ROSMARINIC ACID.
ROSEMARY ALSO CONTAINS A HALF-DOZEN COMPOUNDS THAT ARE REPORTED TO PREVENT THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, AROMATHERAPISTS
SUGGEST USING ROSEMARY OIL FOR TREATING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. (THEY ALSO RECOMMEND OILS OF BALM, FENNEL AND SAGE.)
ROSEMARY HAS A LONG HISTORY AS A MEMORYENHANCING HERB, SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S KNOWN AS
THE HERB OF REMEMBRANCE. I THINK ROSEMARY
SHAMPOO, ROSEMARY TEA AND
ROSEMARY IN THE BATHWATER
WOULD HAVE ANTI-ALZHEIMER'S ACTIVITY SIMILAR TO THAT OF TACRINE OR
HUPERZINE.
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT IT'S SAFE
AND PLEASANT TO USE ROSEMARY IN
ALL OF THESE FORMS. IF I'M WRONG,
THERE'S LITTLE OR NO HARM DONE.
AND IF I'M RIGHT, IT'S ALL TO THE
GOOD.
OF THE ROSEMARY COMPOUNDS THAT RETARD THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE, SEVERAL IF
NOT ALL CAN BE ABSORBED THROUGH
THE SKIN, AND SOME PROBABLY
CROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER.
THUS, USING ROSEMARY SHAMPOO
REGULARLY COULD CONCEIVABLY
HELP PRESERVE ACETYLCHOLINE IN
ROSEMARY
ORIGINALLY USED TO PRESERVE^
MEATS, ROSEMARY IS SAID TO
IMPROVE MEMORY.
THE BRAIN JUST AS TACRINE DOES. YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIAL HERBAL SHAMPOO THAT
CONTAINS ROSEMARY, OR YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN BY ADDING ROSEMARY TINCTURE TO
YOUR FAVORITE HERBAL SHAMPOO.
W BRAZIL NUT (BERTHOLETTIA EXCELSA). IN ADDITION TO LOOKING INTO TREATMENTS FOCUSED ON PREVENTING THE BREAKDOWN OF ACETYLCHOLINE, RESEARCHERS HAVE
ALSO BEEN STUDYING POSSIBLE TREATMENTS THAT WILL SUPPLEMENT PEOPLE'S SUPPLY
OF CHOLINE, A BUILDING BLOCK FOR ACETYLCHOLINE.
LECITHIN CONTAINS CHOLINE, AND ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, BRAZIL NUTS ARE
THE RICHEST FOOD SOURCES OF LECITHIN (UP TO 10 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS).
38
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
MANY OTHER PLANT FOODS AND HERBS
ALSO CONTAIN GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF
LECITHIN. THEY INCLUDE, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY, DANDELION
FLOWERS, POPPY SEEDS, SOYBEANS AND
MUNG BEANS.
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF
PLANTS, INCLUDING FENUGREEK LEAVES
AND SHEPHERD'S PURSE, THAT CONTAIN
CHOLINE ITSELF. OTHER PLANT FOODS AND
HERBS THAT CONTAIN SMALL AMOUNTS OF
CHOLINE INCLUDE HOREHOUND, GINSENG,
COWPEA, ENGLISH PEA, MUNG BEANS,
SPONGE GOURD, LENTILS AND CHINESE
ANGELICA, ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI.
RESEARCHERS HAVE TRIED FEEDING
HIGH-CHOLINE AND HIGH-LECITHIN FOODS
TO PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S. PRELIMINARY RESULTS WERE ENCOURAGING, BUT
MORE RECENT STUDIES HAVE FAILED TO
FIND SIGNIFICANT MEMORY IMPROVEMENT. I REMAIN CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
THAT EATING FOODS CONTAINING CHOLINE
AND LECITHIN MIGHT HELP.
W DANDELION (TARAXACUM
OFFICINALE). THESE FLOWERS ARE ONE
OF OUR BETTER SOURCES OF LECITHIN, AND
THEY'RE ALSO A REASONABLE SOURCE OF
CHOLINE (THE TWO OFTEN SHOW UP IN
THE SAME FOODS). LECITHIN INCREASES
CONCENTRATIONS OF ACETYLCHOLINE IN THE BRAIN AND IMPROVES MEMORY IN LABORATORY MICE. THERE'S NO PROOF YET THAT THIS TREATMENT WORKS IN PEOPLE, BUT I'M
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY. BESIDES, DANDELIONS ARE VERY NUTRITIOUS.
W FAVA BEANS (VICIA FABA). THESE BEANS ARE QUITE RICH IN LECITHIN.
FAVA BEANS ARE A KEY INGREDIENT IN MY BIBLICAL BRAINFOOD SOUP. IN FACT, MANY
BEANS ARE RICH IN LECITHIN AND CHOLINE AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ANY DIET, NOT
JUST THOSE FOR PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT PREVENTING AND TREATING ALZHEIMER'S.
W FENUGREEK {TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). LITTLE DID I KNOW WHEN
I HAD ALU METHI AT AN INDIAN RESTAURANT THAT I WAS INDULGING IN STEAMED FENUBIBLKAL BRAINFOOD SOUP
THIS SOUP, MADE ENTIRELY FROM PLANTS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE, IS A GOOD BET FOR ANYONE
WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. MANY OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE RICH IN CHOLINE, A COMPOUND
THAT MANY RESEARCHERS BELIEVE IS HELPFUL FOR
PEOPLE WITH THIS CONDITION.
THE INGREDIENTS TO USE IN THE SOUP
ARE BARLEY, BOTTLE GOURD, DANDELION FLOWERS
AND GREENS, FAVA BEANS, FLAXSEED, LENTILS,
POPPY SEEDS, STINGING NETTLE, GROUND WALNUTS AND CRACKED WHEAT. (YOU'LL NEED TO
WEAR GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING STINGING
NETTLE LEAVES, BUT THE FUZZY STINGERS LOSE
THEIR STING WHEN THE LEAVES ARE COOKED.)
SEASON THE SOUP WITH BALM, ROSEMARY, SAGE AND SAVORY. THESE HELP THE
BRAIN HOLD ON TO ITS ACETYLCHOLINE, ANOTHER
COMPOUND THAT RESEARCHERS BELIEVE TO BE
HELPFUL.
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THESE
INGREDIENTS TO CREATE A SOUP THAT YOU CAN
ENJOY. NOT ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS HAVE TO
BE USED AT ONCE. IN FACT, YOU PROBABLY
WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEM ALL AT ONCE. YOU
COULD SIMPLY KEEP THE LIST HANDY AND ADD
AS MANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS AS POSSIBLE
TO OTHER SOUPS YOU MIGHT BE MAKING.
39
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
GREEK LEAVES. THESE ARE AMONG THE BETTER DIETARY SOURCES OF CHOLINE (UP TO 1.3
PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS). AS WE HAVE SEEN, DIETARY CHOLINE COULD CONCEIVABLY HELP PREVENT AND TREAT ALZHEIMER'S.
FENUGREEK GREENS ARE ALSO A GOOD SOURCE OF BETA-CAROTENE, AN ANTIOXIDANT
THAT MIGHT ALSO HELP PREVENT OR SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER'S.
W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). HUNDREDS OF EUROPEAN STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USE OF STANDARDIZED GINKGO LEAF EXTRACT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING, INCLUDING MEMORY LOSS AND POOR CIRCULATION.
THERE'S NOT MUCH DATA ON USING GINKGO TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S, BUT I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF IT HELPED. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TRYING. YOU CAN TAKE 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN
LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
W SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY HERBALIST JOHN
GERARD SAID THAT SAGE "HELPETH A WEAKE BRAINE OR MEMORY AND RESTORETH THEM
. . . IN A SHORT TIME." BRITISH RESEARCHERS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SAGE INHIBITS THE
ENZYME THAT BREAKS DOWN ACETYLCHOLINE, THUS PRESERVING THE COMPOUND THAT
SEEMS TO HELP PREVENT AND TREAT ALZHEIMER'S. LIKE ROSEMARY, SAGE IS ALSO WELLENDOWED WITH ANTIOXIDANTS. JUST BE JUDICIOUS: SAGE CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
THUJONE, A COMPOUND THAT IN VERY HIGH DOSES MAY CAUSE CONVULSIONS.
VV STINGING NETTLE (VRTICA DIOICA). THIS HERB CONTAINS CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNTS OF THE MINERAL BORON, WHICH CAN DOUBLE LEVELS OF THE HORMONE ESTROGEN CIRCULATING IN THE BODY. AND ESTROGEN, TESTED IN SEVERAL STUDIES, HELPED
IMPROVE SHORT-TERM MEMORY AND ALSO HELPED ELEVATE THE MOODS OF SOME
PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S.
"V*. WILLOW (SALBC, VARIOUS SPECIES). SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A LOWER
INCIDENCE OF ALZHEIMER'S IN THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
DRUGS FOR ARTHRITIS. IF THESE MEDICINES HELP PREVENT ALZHEIMER'S, THEN WILLOW
BARK, THE HERBAL SOURCE OF ASPIRIN, SHOULD HELP AS WELL. REMEMBER, THOUGH,
THAT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE
HERBS, EITHER.
V GOTU KOLA (CENTEUA ASIATICA). THIS HERB HAS A CENTURIES-OLD FOLK
REPUTATION AS A MEMORY HERB THAT HELPS MAINTAIN STRONG MENTAL VIGOR. I DOUBT
THAT IT WOULD HAVE MAINTAINED THIS REPUTATION IF THERE WEREN'T SOMETHING TO IT.
V HERB GARDENING. IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF ALZHEIMER'S OR ARE
OTHERWISE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DISEASE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER STARTING
AN HERB GARDEN. THIS WOULD GIVE YOU AN ONGOING SOURCE OF THE HERBS THAT SHOW
PROMISE AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S. ALL OF THEM CAN BE GROWN, AT LEAST AS ANNUALS,
IN THE LOWER 48 STATES. NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO GARDENING REQUIRES THOUGHT,
CREATIVITY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ALL OF WHICH I BELIEVE HELP TO PRESERVE BRAIN

AMENORRHEA
S
HE WAS UNDER 40, NOT PREGNANT, AND SHE HADN'T HAD A PERIOD IN SIX
MONTHS. THE DOCTORS HAD CHECKED HER FOR EVERYTHING—INCLUDING ENDOMETRIOSIS AND CANCER—AND FOUND NOTHING.
AMENORRHEA—THE MEDICAL TERM FOR LACK OF MENSTRUATION IN WOMEN WHO
SHOULD BE HAVING REGULAR PERIODS—IS A SIGN THAT SOMETHING IN THE BODY HAS GONE
WRONG. THE CAUSE COULD BE ANYTHING FROM A STRESS REACTION OR A HORMONE IMBALANCE
TO SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS, AND IT SOMETIMES TAKES A WHILE TO PINPOINT THE PROBLEM.
IN DESPERATION, THIS WOMAN CALLED ME AFTER BEING REFERRED BY WASHINGTON'S
MIND-BODY INSTITUTE. SHE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE HER PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY A MEDICATION THAT SHE WAS TAKING, WHICH WAS POSSIBLY ALTERING THE LEVELS OF THE FEMALE
HORMONE ESTROGEN IN HER BODY.
I TOLD HER THAT SHE MIGHT NORMALIZE HER ESTROGEN LEVELS WITH THE HELP OF THE
ESTROGEN-LIKE SUBSTANCES CALLED PHYTOESTROGENS THAT ARE FOUND IN MANY PLANTS,
INCLUDING SOYBEANS AND WILD YAMS. I ALSO MENTIONED CHASTEBERRY, AN HERB WITH
A WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION FOR RESTORING MENSTRUAL FLOW. SHE SAID SHE'D TRY CHASTEBERRY AND PHYTOESTROGENS. MONTHS LATER, SHE CALLED AGAIN TO SAY SHE WAS QUITE
SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR AMENORRHEA
HERBS THAT BRING ON MENSTRUAL FLOW—FOR WHATEVER REASON—ARE KNOWN AS
EMMENAGOGUES. BACK IN THE DAYS BEFORE MODERN MEDICINE, WOMEN OFTEN USED
EMMENAGOGUES FOR TWO REASONS. SOME USED THE HERBS AS A KIND OF MORNING-AFTER
CONTRACEPTION, BECAUSE NOT MUCH ELSE WAS AVAILABLE. OTHERS USED THEM TO TREAT
AMENORRHEA.
EMMENAGOGUES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR CONTRACEPTION, BUT THEY MIGHT
STILL HELP WITH AMENORRHEA. THERE ARE DOZENS, IF NOT HUNDREDS, OF EMMENAGOGUE
HERBS AND PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS) IN MY VARIOUS DATABASES.
4 1
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR DOCTOR FOR A DIAGNOSIS IF YOU HAVE AMENORRHEA. THE
STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT IS HORMONE THERAPY, BUT HORMONE TREATMENTS ARE
TRICKY, REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED MONITORING AND IN MANY CASES,
G FAIL TO GET RESULTS. IN MY EXPERIENCE, EMMENAGOGUES OFTEN
J P RESTORE NORMAL MENSTRUAL FLOW AND PROVIDE CONSIDERABLE
EMOTIONAL RELIEF. YOU MIGHT ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT TRYING
THESE SAFE AND GENTLE HERBS BEFORE RESORTING TO HORMONES.
FROM THE LONGER LIST IN MY DATABASE, HERE ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITES.
V ^ ^ CHASTEBERRY (VITEX AGNUSCASTIIS). IN ONE SMALL STUDY, 20 WOMEN
WITH AMENORRHEA WERE GIVEN 40 DROPS
DAILY OF A VITEX EXTRACT, THEN WERE MONITORED FOR SIX MONTHS. FIFTEEN COMPLETED
THE STUDY, AND 10 OF THEM HAD THEIR
MENSTRUAL CYCLES RESTORED.
AMENORRHEA IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED
WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEVELS OF THE HORMONE PROLACTIN, AND DRUGS THAT REDUCE
PROLACTIN USUALLY RESTORE THE MENSTRUAL
CYCLE TO NORMAL. CHASTEBERRY ACTS JUST
LIKE THESE DRUGS.
THE TYPICAL DOSE IS 20 MILLIGRAMS
PER DAY OF A TINCTURE MADE FROM THE
FRUITS. IN GERMANY, HERBAL MEDICINES
ARE WIDELY USED AND OFTEN RECOMMENDED
BY DOCTORS. ONE POPULAR GERMAN AMENORRHEA PREPARATION (FEMISANA) IS A TINCTURE OF CHASTEBERRY FRUITS, ALONG WITH
GREATER CELANDINE, BLACK COHOSH AND PASQUE-FLOWER (PULSATILLA VULGARIS).
VV BLACK COHOSH (CIMICIFUGA RACERNOSA) AND BLUE COHOSH (CAULOPHYUIUN THALICTROIDES). THESE WERE THE AMERICAN INDIANS' TWO FAVORITE HERBS
FOR GYNECOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS. IT TURNS OUT THAT BLACK COHOSH HAS POTENT ESTROGEN-LIKE ACTIVITY, AND BLUE COHOSH STIMULATES UTERINE CONTRACTIONS.
^ CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). MANY PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH HAVE USED WILD
CARROT (QUEEN ANNE'S LACE) SEED, WHICH IS APPARENTLY EFFECTIVE AS BOTH AN EMMENAGOGUE AND A MORNING-AFTER CONTRACEPTIVE. INDIAN RESEARCHERS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT CARROT SEED HAS ANTI-IMPLANTATION ACTIVITY IN LABORATORY ANIMALS.
CHASTEBERRY
AN EXTRACT OF THESE BERRIES HELPS RESTORE
THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE TO NORMAL.
42
AMENORRHEA
^ CELERY (APIUM GRAVEOLENS). CELERY SEED CONTAINS BUTYLIDENEPHTHALIDE, A CHEMICAL THAT HELPS TRIGGER MENSTRUAL FLOW.
V DILL (ANETHUM GRAVEOLENS). THE COMPOUND APIOLE IN DILL IS SUCH A
POWERFUL EMMENAGOGUE THAT MOST HERBALISTS I RESPECT WARN PREGNANT WOMEN
NOT TO USE IT IN MEDICINAL CONCENTRATIONS. (DON'T PANIC, THOUGH—EATING A DILL
PICKLE IS OKAY.) IF YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE MENSTRUAL FLOW, YOU CAN BREW A TEA
USING TWO TEASPOONS OF MASHED SEEDS.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). THIS HERB CONTAINS UP TO 4
PERCENT BETAINE, A PHYTOESTROGEN AND EMMENAGOGUE THAT IS ALSO FOUND IN BEETS,
CARROTS, CHARD, CHICORY, OATS, ORANGES AND YARROW.
YOU MIGHT TRY MARSH MALLOW AND YARROW TEA. FOR A TASTY VEGETABLE DISH THAT
DELIVERS A GOOD DOSE OF BETAINE, TRY STEAMED CARROTS AND CHARD WITH BEETS.
^ TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). TRADITIONAL CHINESE AND INDIAN PHYSICIANS RECOMMEND TURMERIC TO TREAT AMENORRHEA. I HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT ITS
SAFETY, BUT I CANNOT VOUCH FOR ITS EFFICACY. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH A TRY. FOR A MEDICINAL DOSE, YOU CAN MAKE A CURRY, HEAVY ON THE TURMERIC, OR SIMPLY BREW A
STRONG TEA.
V ASSORTED HERBS. OTHER HERBS THAT HELP AMENORRHEA ARE SO PLENTIFUL
AND WIDELY AVAILABLE THAT I'D FEEL AS IF I WEREN'T DOING MY JOB IF I DIDN'T LIST
SOME OF THEM. YOU COULD COMBINE DASHES OF WHICHEVER OF THESE HERBS YOU HAVE
ON HAND, POUR BOILING WATER OVER THEM AND STEEP FOR 15 MINUTES. THEY ARE AGRIMONY, ANGELICA, BETONY, CALAMINTH, CARAWAY, CATNIP, CORIANDER, CILANTRO,
CUMIN, CHINESE ANGELICA (ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI), FENNEL, FEVERFEW, GINGER,
HOREHOUND, HYSSOP, JUNIPER, LAVENDER, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA), LOVAGE, MARIGOLD, MARJORAM, MOTHERWORT, NUTSEDGE, OREGANO, PARSLEY, PENNYROYAL,
ROSELLE, ROSEMARY, RUE, SAFFRON, TANSY, TARRAGON, THYME, WILD CHERVIL, WINTERGREEN, WORMSEED (ALSO KNOWN AS EPAZOTE), YARROW AND YLANG-YLANG.
I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT FRUITS AND ROOTS WITH ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN PROTEIN (PROTEOLYTICS) ARE FOLKLORIC EMMENAGOGUES. THESE INCLUDE FIGS, GINGER, PAPAYA AND PINEAPPLE.

ANGFINA
I
T'S AMAZING HOW MUCH HERBAL INFORMATION YOU CAN PICK UP WANDERING
THE HALLS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA). MANY OF MY
COLLEAGUES THERE USED TO ASK ME FOR HERBAL ADVICE AND FOR SOLUTIONS TO ASSORTED
HEALTH PROBLEMS.
ONE OF MY MORE CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES—NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WHO
GRAVITATED TOWARD HERBAL MEDICINE—SURPRISED ME ONE DAY BY ASKING ME WHAT
SORT OF HERBAL CONCOCTION I MIGHT RECOMMEND FOR ANGINA. THIS PROBLEM HAD
BEEN BOTHERING HIM FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.
I MENTIONED A COUPLE OF THE HERBS IN THIS CHAPTER—HAWTHORN AND GARLIC—
AND HE THANKED ME. THEN HE TOLD ME THAT HE'D BEEN TAKING GINGER FOR ABOUT A
WEEK, AND HE FELT CONSIDERABLY BETTER.
THAT WAS A NEW ONE ON ME. I KNEW THAT GINGER HELPED LOWER CHOLESTEROL
AND BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH BENEFITS THE HEART, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT HAD ANTIANGINA BENEFITS AS WELL. IT TURNED OUT THAT HE WAS RIGHT—IT DOES.
ANGINA, TECHNICALLY ANGINA PECTORIS, IS A FORM OF HEART DISEASE THAT CAUSES
MODERATE TO SEVERE CHEST PAIN. IN STABLE ANGINA, THE PAIN DEVELOPS AFTER SOME
FORM OF PHYSICAL EXERTION, ANYTHING FROM A BRISK JOG TO A LEISURELY STROLL. IN UNSTABLE ANGINA, THE PAIN STRIKES WHILE A PERSON IS AT REST.
ANGINA IS CAUSED BY ATHEROSCLEROSIS, A DISEASE IN WHICH CHOLESTEROL-RICH
DEPOSITS CALLED PLAQUE CAUSE THE CORONARY ARTERIES TO NARROW. ATHEROSCLEROSIS
LIMITS BLOOD FLOW INTO THE HEART, AND THE RESULTING LACK OF NOURISHMENT AND
OXYGEN TRIGGERS ANGINA PAIN. BOTH KINDS OF ANGINA (BUT PARTICULARLY UNSTABLE
ANGINA) INDICATE THAT A PERSON HAS MAJOR RISK OF HEART ATTACK.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ANGINA
ANYONE WITH ANGINA SHOULD BE UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE, AND IT'S EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW YOUR DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. TYPICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
INVOLVE TAKING NITROGLYCERIN, ASPIRIN AND FREQUENTLY OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT
LOWER CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE.
IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEDICINAL HERBS THAT
CAN HELP. BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY OF THESE HERBS, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD DISCUSS IT
WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
W V HAWTHORN (CRATAEGUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). IN EUROPE, HAWTHORN
BERRY PREPARATIONS ARE WIDELY USED TO TREAT MILD ANGINA.
EXTENSIVE RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT HAWTHORN EXTRACTS IMPROVE HEART
44
ANGIN A
FUNCTION BY OPENING UP THE CORONARY ARTERIES. THIS IN TURN IMPROVES THE BLOOD
AND OXYGEN SUPPLY TO THE HEART. HAWTHORN ALSO DECREASES BLOOD CHOLESTEROL
LEVELS, ANOTHER HEART-HEALTHY BENEFIT, AND IT IS SAFE TO USE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS
OF TIME, ACCORDING TO EUROPEAN CLINICAL EXPERIENCE.
IN HIS EXCELLENT BOOK HERBS OF CHOICE, VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, EXPLAINS THAT HAWTHORN'S HEART
BENEFITS ARE DUE TO SPECIAL COMPOUNDS IN THE
PLANT—OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS).
PEOPLE GET ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS FROM
SEVERAL OTHER COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS FLAVONOIDS,
WHICH OPEN (DILATE) THE SMOOTH VESSELS OF THE
CORONARY ARTERIES.
COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN EXPERT PANEL
THAT EVALUATES MEDICINAL HERBS FOR THE GERMAN
GOVERNMENT, APPROVES HAWTHORN FOR A NUMBER
OF HEART PROBLEMS. NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND A
DAILY DOSAGE OF 240 TO 480 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT. HAWTHORN IS A POWERFUL HEART
MEDICINE, SO DO NOT TAKE IT WITHOUT DISCUSSING
IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
VV ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA)
AND OTHER HERBS OF THE CARROT FAMILY. CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS ARE A
STANDARD CLASS OF ANTI-ANGINA DRUGS, AND ANGELICA CONTAINS 15 COMPOUNDS THAT
ACT MUCH LIKE THESE CHANNEL BLOCKERS. SIMILAR COMPOUNDS APPEAR IN OTHER
PLANTS IN THE CARROT FAMILY: CARROTS, CELERY, FENNEL, PARSLEY AND PARSNIPS.
IF I HAD ANGINA, FD COMBINE THEM ALL IN A DRINK THAT CONSISTS OF JUICED ANGELICA, CARROTS, CELERY, FENNEL, PARSLEY AND PARSNIPS, WITH SOME WATER AND SPICES
ADDED.
IT'S WELL-KNOWN THAT VEGETARIANS HAVE A LOW INCIDENCE OF HEART DISEASE.
USUALLY, THEIR LOWER-FAT DIET GETS THE CREDIT. BUT I'D BE WILLING TO BET THAT PART OF
THE REASON IS THAT THEY EAT LOTS OF PLANTS FROM THE CARROT FAMILY.
W BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTILLIIS) AND OTHER FRUITS. BILBERRY CONTAINS COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS ANTHOCYANINS THAT HAVE A CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING EFFECT. THIS HERB IS ALSO A VASODILATOR THAT OPENS BLOOD VESSELS AND LOWERS BLOOD
PRESSURE. ANTHOCYANINS HELP PREVENT FORMATION OF THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER
HEART ATTACK.
UNTIL PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS START STUDYING ANTHOCYANINS, WE WON'T KNOW
HOW EFFECTIVELY THESE COMPOUNDS HELP TO PREVENT CORONARY PROBLEMS. BUT ONE
HAWTHORN
THE FLOWERS, LEAVES AND FRUITS
OF THIS PLANT ARE ALL USED FOR
MEDICINAL PURPOSES.
4 5
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THING IS CLEAR. BILBERRIES ARE NOT THE ONLY FRUIT THAT CONTAINS THEM. OTHER GOOD
SOURCES INCLUDE BLACKBERRIES, BLACK CHOKEBERRIES, BOYSENBERRIES, BLACK CURRANTS, BLUEBERRIES, CHERRIES, CRANBERRIES, RED GRAPES AND RED RASPBERRIES. I SUSPECT THAT ALL OF THESE FRUITS MIGHT HELP PREVENT AND TREAT ANGINA.
W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A. CEPA) BOTH OF THESE SPICY
HERBS HELP TREAT HEART DISEASE BY LOWERING CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE AND
BY PREVENTING FORMATION OF THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER HEART ATTACK.
ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY, MUNCHING ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC DAILY CUTS CHOLESTEROL BY 9 PERCENT. EVERY 1 PERCENT DECREASE IN CHOLESTEROL TRANSLATES TO A 2
PERCENT DECREASE IN HEART ATTACK RISK, SO A CLOVE A DAY REDUCES RISK OF HEART ATTACK BY 18 PERCENT. ONIONS HAVE SIMILAR BENEFITS, ALTHOUGH NOT AS PRONOUNCED.
VV GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). AFTER MY USD A COLLEAGUE PERSUADED
ME TO EXPLORE GINGER'S ANTI-ANGINA BENEFITS, I READ THAT IT WAS ENDORSED FOR HEART
ATTACK PREVENTION IN GINGER: COMMON SPICE AND WONDER DRUG BY NEW ENGLAND
HERBALIST PAUL SCHULICK. HE NOTES THAT AN ISRAELI CARDIOLOGY CLINIC NOW RECOMMENDS A DAILY HALF-TEASPOON OF POWDERED GINGER.
IT SEEMS THAT GINGER IS AN ANTIOXIDANT THAT OFFERS THE BLOOD VESSELS SOME
PROTECTION AGAINST THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY CHOLESTEROL. GINGER ALSO BOOSTS THE
STRENGTH OF HEART MUSCLE TISSUE, AS DOES THE MEDICATION DIGITALIS. IF I HAD
ANGINA, I WOULD TAKE GINGER REGULARLY AND USE IT LIBERALLY IN COOKING.
VV KHELLA (AMRNI MAJUS). A 1951 ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE TOUTED THE ANTI-ANGINA BENEFITS OF KHELLIN, A COMPOUND IN
KHELLA THAT INCREASES BLOOD FLOW INTO THE HEART. THE ARTICLE CALLED KHELLIN "A
SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DRUG FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANGINA PECTORIS."
AS LITTLE AS 30 MILLIGRAMS OF KHELLIN A DAY CAN HELP, BUT NOTED NATUROPATH
MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHOR OF ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOLARLY BOOKS ON NUTRITIONAL AND NATUROPATHIC HEALING, RECOMMENDS TAKING 250 TO 300 MILLIGRAMS DAILY OF KHELLA EXTRACTS THAT ARE
STANDARDIZED FOR KHELLIN CONTENT (TYPICALLY 12 PERCENT). IF YOU BUY KHELLA IN
STANDARDIZED EXTRACT FORM, THAT INFORMATION WILL BE ON THE LABEL.
' W KUDZU (PUERARIA LOBATA). CHINESE CLINICAL STUDIES ATTEST TO THE ANTIANGINA BENEFITS OF KUDZU. IN ONE STUDY, 71 PEOPLE TOOK 10 TO 15 GRAMS OF A ROOT
EXTRACT A DAY FOR 4 TO 22 WEEKS. DURING THIS TIME, 29 WERE MUCH IMPROVED, 20
SHOWED SOME IMPROVEMENT, AND 22 SHOWED LITTLE OR NO IMPROVEMENT.
KUDZU EXTRACTS DILATE CORONARY ARTERIES, INCREASING BLOOD FLOW AND DECREASING BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY ALSO HELP STABILIZE HEART RHYTHM. KUDZU ROOT
PREPARATIONS HAVE PRODUCED NO ADVERSE EFFECTS IN HUMAN TRIALS.
VV PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT
PROTECT CELLS FROM DAMAGE CAUSED BY FREE RADICALS, HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN MOL46
ANGIN A
ECULES IN THE BODY. AND THEY APPEAR TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN PREVENTING HEART DISEASE. I RECOMMEND PURSLANE BECAUSE IT'S EXTREMELY WELL ENDOWED WITH ANTIOXIDANTS, AND IN ADDITION, IT'S OUR BEST LEAFY SOURCE OF OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,
BENEFICIAL OILS THAT ALSO HELP PREVENT HEART DISEASE.
VV WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT LOW-DOSE
ASPIRIN—ANYWHERE FROM 30 MILLIGRAMS TO A STANDARD 325-MILLIGRAM TABLET A
DAY—HELPS PREVENT HEART ATTACK BY PREVENTING THE FORMATION OF BLOOD CLOTS.
THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR PEOPLE WITH ANGINA.
WILLOW BARK IS HERBAL ASPIRIN. A DAILY CUP OR TWO OF WILLOW BARK TEA WOULD
PROBABLY PROVIDE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE LOW ASPIRIN DOSE RECOMMENDED FOR HEART
ATTACK PREVENTION. (INCIDENTALLY, THE LATEST STUDIES SHOW THAT ASPIRIN, AND PRESUMABLY WILLOW BARK AS WELL, ALSO HELP PREVENT COLON CANCER. SO THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE REASON TO ADOPT IT.) REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). PRIMROSE IS AN EXCELLENT
SOURCE OF GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA), A COMPOUND THAT LOWERS BOTH CHOLESTEROL
AND BLOOD PRESSURE. GLA ALSO HAS AN ANTI-CLOTTING EFFECT. MY FRIEND C. LEIGH
BROADHURST, PH.D., A GEOCHEMIST WITH EXPERTISE IN NUTRITIONAL MEDICINE, SUGGESTS
THAT EVENING PRIMROSE AND FLAXSEED, WHICH IS DISCUSSED BELOW, SHOULD BE TAKEN
TOGETHER.
V FLAX (LINWN USTIATISSIMUM). FLAXSEED CONTAINS AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT
OF ALPHA-LINOLENIC ACID, A COMPOUND THAT MANY CLAIM HAS HEART-PROTECTIVE ABILITY.
V SICHUAN LOVAGE (LIGIISTICUM CHUANXIONG). THIS ASIAN HERB HELPS
PREVENT THE FORMATION OF HEART ATTACK—TRIGGERING BLOOD CLOTS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D., AND NOTED
ARKANSAS HERBALIST AND PHOTOGRAPHER STEVEN FOSTER. IN THEIR BOOK, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS, THEY NOTE THAT THIS HERB CONTAINS COMPOUNDS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN ANGELICA. THESE COMPOUNDS DILATE THE CORONARY
ARTERIES, INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEART. SMALL WONDER THAT SICHUAN LOVAGE IS
USED IN CHINA TO TREAT ANGINA AND OTHER HEART CONDITIONS.
47
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
I
HAVE ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS), A FORM OF ARTHRITIS MOST PEOPLE HAVE
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. AS CAUSES INFLAMMATION ALONG THE SPINAL COLUMN,
RESULTING IN BACK PAIN AND STIFFNESS. (ANKYLOSING MEANS "RIGID," SPONDY- IS
"SPINE," AND -ITIS MEANS "INFLAMMATION").
MEN DEVELOP AS 2.5 TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN WOMEN. CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE
THAT IT AFFECTS ABOUT 318,000 MEN AND 127,000 WOMEN. NINETY PERCENT OF CASES
DEVELOP BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 40, BUT I WASN'T DIAGNOSED UNTIL I WAS 60,
AFTER MY SLIPPED DISK OPERATION IN 1991.
WHILE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT CAUSES AS, THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTION THAT IT
MAY BE AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, A DESCRIPTION THAT ALSO FITS RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS, ANOTHER KIND OF JOINT DISEASE. NORMALLY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS
ONLY INVADING MICROBES, WHICH KEEPS YOU FROM SUCCUMBING TO INFECTION. SOMETIMES, HOWEVER, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM GETS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BE ATTACKING AND TURNS ITS LETHAL POWER AGAINST THE BODY ITSELF. DEPENDING UPON
WHAT PART OF THE BODY IT ATTACKS, ANY NUMBER OF SO-CALLED AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
CAN RESULT.
PAIN GETS A GRIP
IN MY CASE, AS HAS AFFECTED THE VERTEBRAE IN MY NECK, THE DISKS BETWEEN
THE VERTEBRAE AND THE SURROUNDING LIGAMENTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE. THEY'RE
STIFF AND PAINFUL, AND OCCASIONALLY PRESSURE ON THE NERVE ROOTS CAUSES PAIN TO
RADIATE DOWN MY ARMS. AS HAS ALSO MADE ME LEAN FORWARD A BIT.
IT OFTEN TAKES YEARS FOR AS TO BE DIAGNOSED, BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ASSUME
THAT IT'S ORDINARY LOW BACK PAIN, WHICH IS VERY COMMON. (AS OFTEN MAKES ITS
APPEARANCE IN THE LOW BACK.) IF AS REMAINS UNTREATED, THE RISK IS LIFELONG BACK
DISABILITY. THE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CAN DESTROY THE CARTILAGE BETWEEN THE VERTEBRAE. AS CAN ALSO LEAD TO BONY GROWTHS THAT FUSE THE VERTEBRAE AND CAUSE PERMANENT SPINAL RIGIDITY.
WHEN I SLIPPED A DISK AND HAD SURGERY, MY EXPENSIVE NEUROSURGEON DISMISSED EXERCISE, SAYING THAT IT WOULDN'T HELP ME BECAUSE OF MY AS. IF I EVER
HAPPEN TO RUN INTO HIM AGAIN, I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HIM THAT EXERCISE HAS WORKED
QUITE WELL TO HELP RELIEVE THE PAIN THESE LAST FIVE YEARS. I'LL ALSO BE SURE TO TELL
HIM THAT THE KIND OF OPERATION THAT HE PERFORMED ON ME IS NOW REGARDED AS
MEDICALLY USELESS.
48
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
WHILE HE WAS DEEP INSIDE MY NECK, MY NEUROSURGEON PERFORMED A CERVICAL
FUSION, MEANING THAT HE FUSED TWO OF THE VERTEBRAE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT NATURE
WAS DOING ALL ALONG, JUST GOING ABOUT IT A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY. FUSED DISKS ARE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS EVENTUALLY WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. MAYBE I JUST
SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR NATURE TO TAKE ITS COURSE. MAYBE NOT. I'LL NEVER KNOW.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
MY NEUROSURGEON ALSO SAID THAT THERE ARE NO HERBAL APPROACHES TO BACK
PROBLEMS. WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE SAID WAS THAT THERE WERE NONE THAT HE KNEW OF.
IN FACT, SEVERAL HERBS CAN HELP. I SHOULD BE CLEAR RIGHT HERE THAT HERBS WON'T
CURE YOUR AS. IF YOU HAVE IT, GET YOURSELF A GOOD RHEUMATOLOGIST AND FOLLOW HIS
ADVICE. BUT HERBS CAN DEFINITELY HELP. THEY'VE HELPED ME.
W V GINGER {ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). GINGER CONTAINS ZINGIBAIN, A SPECIAL
KIND OF PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO CHEMICALLY BREAK DOWN PROTEIN. ADOLPH'S MEAT TENDERIZER WORKS BECAUSE IT CONTAINS THIS KIND OF ENZYME.
CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, ACCORDING TO NOTED NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., COAUTHOR OFENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOLARLY BOOKS
ON NUTRITIONAL AND NATUROPATHIC HEALING. THAT MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD HELP RELIEVE AS.
PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL BESIDES ZINGIBAIN, ALSO
PLAY AN ADDITIONAL ROLE IN CONTROLLING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THEY HELP REDUCE
BLOOD LEVELS OF COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS IMMUNE COMPLEXES, HIGH LEVELS OF WHICH
ACTIVATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ATTACK THE BODY ITSELF, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO
TISSUE DAMAGE.
FRESH GINGER ROOT CONTAINS AS MUCH AS 2 PERCENT ZINGIBAIN, WHICH ACCORDING TO AT LEAST ONE RESEARCHER, PAUL SCHULICK, NEW ENGLAND HERBALIST AND
AUTHOR OF GINGER: COMMON SPICE AND WONDER DRUG, IS AS POWERFUL AN ENZYME
AS THE BROMELAIN IN PINEAPPLE OR THE PAPAIN IN PAPAYA. HE INSISTS THAT GINGER IS
ONE OF NATURE'S RICHEST SOURCES OF PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES, CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 180 TIMES MORE THAN THE PAPAYA PLANT.
GINGER IS ALSO WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES. INDIAN AND
SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THAT GINGER (AND CLOSELY RELATED
TURMERIC) IS USEFUL FOR TREATING MOST KINDS OF ARTHRITIS.
GINGER ALSO CONTAINS MORE THAN 12 ANTIOXIDANTS, WHICH HELP NEUTRALIZE THE
HIGHLY REACTIVE MOLECULES—FREE RADICALS—THAT PLAY A ROLE IN CAUSING INFLAMMATION.
FINALLY, SCHULICK ALSO NOTES THAT GINGER OFFERS A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER MAINSTREAM MEDICINE'S TREATMENT OF CHOICE FOR AS, WHICH IS NONSTEROIDAL ANTI49

SOCORRO GUERRA AND HER HUSBAND, CESAR, LIVE IN EASTERN PERU AT THE JUNCTION OF
THE YANOMONO CREEK AND THE AMAZON RIVER. THAT'S SOME 15 MINUTES ON FOOT FROM
THE EXPLORAMA LODGE THAT HOUSES THE ECOTOURISTS WHO ATTEND MY TROPICAL HERB
WORKSHOPS. CESAR RUNS A SUGAR CANE DISTILLERY THAT TURNS OUT AGUARDIENTE, OR
CACHASAS, AN AMAZONIAN RUM USED BY THE LOCALS BOTH MEDICINALLY AND FOR SOCIAL
DRINKING.
SOCORRO IS QUITE THE AMAZONIAN HERBALIST. BACK IN HER KITCHEN, SHE PROUDLY
SHOWS OFF HER REMEDIO PARA REUMATISMO—HER RHEUMATISM REMEDY. I CALL IT SOCORRO'S SECRET, HAVING CONCLUDED THAT IT MIGHT BE AS USEFUL AS ANYTHING OUT THERE
FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND POSSIBLY FOR ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS) AS WELL.
THE SIGNIFICANT INGREDIENTS ARE THE HERB DRAGON'S BLOOD, FIG LATEX (A MILKY SUBSTANCE THAT OOZES FROM THE FIG TREE), GINGER, PORT WINE AND, OF COURSE, HER HUSBAND'S
RUM. GINGER AND FIG LATEX CONTAIN PROTEIN-DIGESTING (PROTEOLYTIC) ENZYMES THAT ARE
USEFUL IN ALLEVIATING THE INFLAMMATORY SYMPTOMS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND POSSIBLY AS. AS FOR THE DRAGON'S BLOOD AND PORT WINE, THEY BOTH CONTAIN GENEROUS
AMOUNTS OF COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS). OPCS ARE ANTIOXIDANTS—SUBSTANCES THAT MOP UP FREE RADICALS, HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN MOLECULES THAT DAMAGE THE BODY'S CELLS.
OF COURSE, SOCORRO DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES OR OPCS. SHE
SIMPLY USES HER FIERY FORMULA TO OBTAIN RELIEF FROM HER REUMATISMO. I'VE TAKEN THE
LIBERTY OF ADDING PINEAPPLE TO SOCORRO'S SECRET, MAKING A VERY TASTY HERBAL PUNCH
THAT'S LOADED WITH PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES.
HERE'S THE MODIFIED RECIPE: ADD ONE TABLESPOON OF DRAGON'S BLOOD AND ONE TABLESPOON OF FIG LATEX TO ONE PINT OF RED WINE AND ONE PINT OF PINEAPPLE JUICE. (BOTH
DRAGON'S BLOOD AND FIG LATEX ARE IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES BUT ARE NOT WIDELY
AVAILABLE, AND THEY ARE NOT APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. YOU
MAY HAVE TO DO SOME SEARCHING.) STIR IN ONE CUP OF SHREDDED GINGER ROOT. SIT BACK
AND ENJOY, WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT YOUR BACK.
INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS). ASPIRIN AND OTHER NSAIDS ARE HARD ON THE
STOMACH, AND LONG-TERM USE CAN LEAD TO ULCERS. GINGER DOES NOT CAUSE STOMACH
PROBLEMS.
I ENJOY GINGER, AND I HOPE IT'S HELPING TO POSTPONE ANY SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS OF AS FOR ME. YOU CAN TAKE GINGER AS AN HERB IN TEA, TINCTURE OR CAPSULES.
IT'S ALSO A TASTY SPICE THAT YOU CAN USE GENEROUSLY IN THE KITCHEN. A DISH PREPARED WITH GINGER WILL ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A MEDICINAL DOSE OF THE HERB.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
VVV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). LIKE GINGER, PINEAPPLE CONTAINS A
PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME, CALLED BROMELAIN.
DR. MURRAY RECOMMENDS TAKING 400 TO 600 MILLIGRAMS OF BROMELAIN THREE
TIMES DAILY ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. YOU CAN BUY PURE BROMELAIN IN NATURAL FOOD
STORES.
LIKING PINEAPPLE AS I DO, I PREFER TO GET MY BROMELAIN FROM THE NATURAL
SOURCE, SO I EAT LOTS OF PINEAPPLE. IN ADDITION TO ZINGIBAIN AND BROMELAIN, THERE
ARE SEVERAL OTHER POTENT PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES THAT SHOULD HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS.
YOU CAN GET THESE ENZYMES BY EATING THE FRUITS AND HERBS THAT CONTAIN THEM. THE
BEST SOURCES INCLUDE BREADFRUIT, GINGER, KIWIFRUIT, PAPAYA AND FIGS.
VV CORN (ZEA MAYS). HOW WELL I REMEMBER MY FIRST TRIP TO AMAZONIAN
PERU BACK IN 1991.1 WAS SUFFERING THE INDIGNITY OF ONE OF THOSE NECK (CERVICAL)
COLLARS. IT HELPED CORRECT THAT FORWARD-LEANING HEAD POSTURE THAT SO MANY OLD
MEN ARE PRONE TO EXHIBIT, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH AS. BUT IN THE AMAZONIAN HUMIDITY, THE COLLAR REALLY CHAFED, AND IT SEEMED TO HURT MY NECK MORE THAN IT
HELPED MY SPINE.
BACK HOME, I WOULD HAVE RUBBED ON SOME SOOTHING TALCUM POWDER. BUT I
DIDN'T HAVE ANY UNTIL ONE NICE ECOTOURING LADY, WITH AN ALABAMA ACCENT LIKE
MINE, GAVE ME SOME OF HER "TROPICAL TALCUM POWDER"—FINELY PULVERIZED CORNSTARCH. SHE HAD WISELY BROUGHT THIS ALONG TO AVOID JUST SUCH CHAFING PROBLEMS
HERSELF. WHEN SHE APPLIED THE FIRST SPRINKLING TO MY ACHING NECK, RELIEF WAS ALMOST IMMEDIATE. THEN SHE GAVE ME A PLASTIC BAG WITH MY OWN STASH OF FINELY
POWDERED CORNSTARCH. I'M NOT SUGGESTING CORNSTARCH TO ALLEVIATE AS ITSELF, JUST TO
HELP RELIEVE THE DERMATITIS YOU MIGHT HAVE IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE STRAPPED INTO A
CERVICAL COLLAR AS A RESULT OF HAVING THIS CONDITION.
VV PIGWEED (AMARANTHNS, VARIOUS SPECIES). THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT GETTING ENOUGH CALCIUM HELPS PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS. I BELIEVE IT'S USEFUL FOR PREVENTING AS AS WELL.
IN MY DATABASE, PIGWEED IS THE BEST PLANT SOURCE OF CALCIUM. OTHER PLANTS
THAT ARE ALSO GOOD SOURCES OF THE ESSENTIAL MINERAL INCLUDE LAMB'S-QUARTERS,
STINGING NETTLE, BROADBEANS, WATERCRESS, LICORICE, MARJORAM, SAVORY, RED CLOVER
SHOOTS, THYME, CHINESE CABBAGE, BASIL, CELERY SEED, CHAYA, DANDELION AND
PURSLANE.
I RECOMMEND EATING GREEN LEAFY VEGETABLES OFTEN AS A REGULAR PART OF YOUR
MEALS. IT'S ALSO GOOD PRACTICE TO DRINK BROTHS OR POTLIKKERS MADE FROM THESE
PLANTS BETWEEN MEALS.
V VEGETARIANISM. SEVERAL STUDIES AND A GOOD DEAL OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE
SUGGEST THAT A LOW-CALORIE VEGETARIAN DIET HELPS ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND INFLAM51

CARTILAGE. I REALIZE THAT IT IS NOT GREEN, BUT THE BOTTOM-LINE ADVICE IS GOING TO TRANSLATE INTO THE SUGGESTION TO TOSS A SOUP BONE INTO YOUR VEGETABLE SOUP. SO BEAR WITH
ME FOR A MOMENT.
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, HEALTH FOOD PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN PROMOTING SHARK
CARTILAGE FOR PREVENTING CANCER. IT SEEMS THAT SHARKS, WHOSE NONBONY SKELETONS
ARE ALL CARTILAGE, DON'T GET CANCER. I CAN'T SAY MUCH OF A POSITIVE NATURE ABOUT
TAKING SHARK CARTILAGE FOR CANCER, BUT THERE IS SOME INTRIGUING RESEARCH SUGGESTING
THAT CHICKEN AND CATTLE CARTILAGE MAY HELP THOSE OF US WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS
(AS).
HARVARD RESEARCHER DAVID TRENTHAM, M.D., HAS DISCOVERED THAT EATING TYPE
II COLLAGEN, A CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND COMPONENT OF CARTILAGE, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTOIMMUNE FORMS OF ARTHRITIS, SPECIFICALLY RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS AND, QUITE POSSIBLY, AS. THE WORK OF IMMUNOLOGIST RACHEL E. CASPI,
'PH.D., AT THE NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE SUPPORTS THE USE OF COLLAGEN THERAPY FOR OTHER
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES.
NOW AUTOIMMUNE, A BIOTECH COMPANY IN LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IS COLLABORATING WITH DR. TRENTHAM ON COLLAGEN STUDIES INVOLVING 280 PEOPLE. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LOWEST DOSE OF COLLAGEN WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE,
PROMPTING RESEARCHERS TO CONSIDER EVEN LOWER DOSAGES IN THE FUTURE. DR. TRENTHAM
DOES NOT YET SAY THAT EATING ANIMAL CARTILAGE WILL ALLEVIATE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS OR
AS, BUT THE STUDIES REPORTED TO DATE JUST MIGHT MAKE A CARTILAGE EATER OUT OF ME.
SOME PEOPLE GO IN FOR CHICKEN GRISTLE, BUT I PREFER TO GET MY COLLAGEN FROM
SOUP BONES, WHICH CONTAIN A GOOD DEAL OF IT. SO TOSSING A SOUP BONE OR TWO INTO
YOUR VEGETABLE SOUP AS IT SIMMERS IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA IF YOU HAVE AS.
MATION OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THIS TYPE OF DIET HELPS
RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS OF A BROAD RANGE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. IF AS IS, IN
FACT, A FORM OF AUTOIMMUNE ARTHRITIS, THEN A CALORIE-RESTRICTED VEGETARIAN DIET
SHOULD HELP RELIEVE THIS CONDITION AS WELL.
THIS TYPE OF DIET IS GOOD FOR HEALTH AND LONGEVITY IN GENERAL, EVEN IF YOU
DON'T HAVE AN AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION. AND IF YOU DO HAVE AS, AT THE VERY LEAST,
THIS DIET CAN HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT, WHICH TAKES PRESSURE OFF ARTHRITIC JOINTS.
CONSIDERING OUR EVOLUTIONARY PAST, I CAN'T RECOMMEND STRICT VEGETARIANISM. I
PREFER JEFFERSONIAN VEGETARIANISM, LETTING MEAT BE A "SPICE" RATHER THAN A MAJOR
MEAL CONSTITUENT.

ARTHRITIS
I
'M THE BASS FIDDLE PLAYER IN A FIVE-MEMBER BAND CALLED DURHAM STATION.
IN RECENT YEARS THREE OF OUR BAND MEMBERS OR THEIR RELATIVES HAVE BEEN
USING AN HERB KNOWN AS STINGING NETTLE TO RELIEVE THEIR ARTHRITIS PAIN. ALTHOUGH
STINGING NETTLE DOES COOK UP INTO A TASTY VEGETABLE, THESE MUSICIANS AREN'T
EATING IT. RATHER, THEY'RE STINGING THEMSELVES WITH IT BY GRASPING THE PLANT IN A
GLOVED HAND AND THEN SWATTING THEIR STIFF, SWOLLEN JOINTS.
THIS PRACTICE, CALLED URTICATION—FROM NETTLE'S BOTANICAL NAME, URTICA
DIOICA—DATES BACK AT LEAST 2,000 YEARS TO BIBLICAL TIMES. ALTHOUGH IT'S AN ODDSOUNDING PRACTICE, THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE FACT THAT IT'S BEEN AROUND SO LONG
PRECISELY BECAUSE IT HELPS SO MANY PEOPLE.
NOT ONLY DOES OUR BANJO PLAYER KEEP A PLANT IN HIS KITCHEN SO THAT HE CAN SELFURTICATE WHEN HIS ARTHRITIS FLARES UP, BUT HE AND THE OTHER ARTHRITIS-AFFLICTED BAND
MEMBERS ARE CONVINCING NONMEMBERS TO TRY THE REMEDY. THE GUITAR PLAYER'S
MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS UNABLE TO WRITE BECAUSE OF ARTHRITIS IN HER HANDS, BUT THE STING
OF THE NETDE IMPROVED THAT. THE FIDDLE PLAYER'S MOTHER NOW HAS STINGING NETTLE
TAKING OVER HER GARDEN, AND SHE SAYS HER ARTHRITIS IS "MUCH IMPROVED."
AND JUST SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT URTICATION IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY CRAZY
MUSICIANS INDULGE IN, MY FORMER SECRETARY AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) KEPT A NETTLE PLANT IN THE OFFICE. SHE WOULD REMOVE THE NETTLES AND
DISCREETLY STING HERSELF ANY TIME ARTHRITIS STIFFENED HER FINGERS.
URTICATION OFTEN PROVIDES CONSIDERABLE RELIEF. SOMETIMES THE STUFF WORKS
PRETTY FAST; I HAVE SEEN ARTHRITIC SWELLING SUBSIDE WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE
STINGS WERE ADMINISTERED.
THE CASE TOR THE STING
I'M OPEN TO THE NOTION THAT STINGING NETTLE'S ANTI-ARTHRITIC ACTION IS BASED
ON DISTRACTION, MEANING THAT THE IRRITATION OF THE STING SIMPLY TAKES PEOPLE'S
MINDS OFF THEIR ARTHRITIS PAIN. THAT'S AN EXPLANATION YOU MIGHT HEAR FROM DOCTORS. BUT AS A BOTANIST, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON IS MORE CHEMICAL THAN PSYCHOLOGICAL.
THE TINY STINGERS OF THE NETTLE PLANT ACTUALLY PROVIDE MICROINJECTIONS OF
SEVERAL CHEMICALS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STINGING SENSATION THAT THE PLANT
CAUSES. ONE M.D. TOLD ME THAT MANY OF THESE CHEMICALS MIGHT ALSO TRIGGER

THE GIN-AND-RAISIN$ CURE
SOME YEARS AGO, THE NEWSMAN PAUL HARVEY RECOMMENDED RAISINS SOAKED IN GIN
FOR ALL MANNER OF ACHES AND PAINS, INCLUDING ARTHRITIS. HERE'S A LETTER I RECEIVED
ON THIS SUBJECT FROM A CORRESPONDENT IN MESA, ARIZONA: "AFTER READING A PAUL
HARVEY COMMENTARY ON GIN-SOAKED RAISINS, A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND I DECIDED TO
GIVE IT A TRY. IT REALLY WORKS. WE HAVE ALL ENJOYED GREAT RELIEF FROM ARTHRITIC ACHES
AND PAINS. AFTER 15 YEARS OF PAIN, I'M ALMOST TOTALLY PAIN-FREE. I'VE BEEN TAKING
PAIN PILLS FOR YEARS WITH ONLY MINIMAL RELIEF. SOME KINDS OF PAIN THAT HAVE BEEN
RELIEVED OR ELIMINATED AFTER TAKING THE GIN-SOAKED RAISIN FORMULA INCLUDE MIGRAINE
HEADACHES, GOUT AND ARTHRITIC PAIN IN JOINTS. SEVERAL PEOPLE REPORTED A DECREASE
IN PAINS THAT AWAKENED THEM AT NIGHT, ENABLING THEM TO HAVE AN UNINTERRUPTED
SLEEP. IN YOUR RESEARCH, HAVE YOU DISCOVERED WHY IT WORKS SO WELL?"
I REPLIED: "NO, BUT I AM GOING HOME TO A GIN COLLINS WITH GRAPE JUICE, SINCE I
PREFER GRAPES TO RAISINS."
IF YOU BENEFIT FROM GIN-STEEPED RAISINS, THE RAISINS PROBABLY DO YOU MORE GOOD
THAN THE GIN. GRAPES AND RAISINS CONTAIN MANY PAIN RELIEVING, ANTI-ARTHRITIC AND
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CHEMICALS. LOOKING OVER THE LONG LIST OF COMPOUNDS THAT OCCUR
NATURALLY IN GRAPES, I SEE SUCH PAIN RELIEVERS AS FERULIC ACID, GENTISIC ACID,
KAEMPFEROL-GLUCOSIDES AND ASPIRIN-LIKE SALICYLIC ACID. GRAPES AND RAISINS ALSO
CONTAIN SEVERAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS: ASCORBIC ACID, CINNAMIC ACID,
COUMARIN, MYRICETIN, QUERCETIN AND QUERCITRIN. AND IN 1997, THERE WAS A FLURRY OF
INTEREST IN RESVERATROL, YET ANOTHER ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUND OF WHICH GRAPES
ARE THE BEST SOURCE. OUNCE FOR OUNCE, RAISINS CONTAIN MORE OF ALL OF THESE COMPOUNDS THAN GRAPES BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN LESS WATER.
ALL OF THESE PAIN RELIEVERS OCCUR AT LOW LEVELS IN RAISINS, SO I DOUBT THAT THE
MERE SEVEN GIN-SOAKED RAISINS THAT HARVEY TOUTED WOULD CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT DOSES.
MY CORRESPONDENT MIGHT HAVE BENEFITED FROM A PLACEBO EFFECT: BELIEVING ENOUGH
IN A REMEDY REALLY CAN HELP IT WORK. BUT A LARGE QUANTITY OF RAISINS MIGHT WELL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT PAIN-RELIEVING AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY BENEFITS. PERSONALLY, PD BE
TEMPTED TO TRY RAISINS BEFORE DEPENDING ON NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS.
THE RAISINS ARE SURELY LESS LIKELY TO DO YOU ANY HARM THAN THE GIN THEY'RE
SOAKED IN, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PRONE TO GOUT. ALCOHOL IS A MAJOR TRIGGER OF EXCRUCIATING GOUT ATTACKS. I CAN GUARANTEE THAT MY BIG TOE WILL SWELL IF I DRINK A SIX-PACK
OF BEER AND DON'T TAKE MY ALLOPURINOL. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOUT (AND ARE NOT AN
ALCOHOLIC), MODEST CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL MAY HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN.

ARTHRITIS
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION THAT WOULD HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS.
AND THERE'S STRONG FOLKLORIC EVIDENCE THAT STINGING NETTLE HAS SOME SPECIFIC
ANTI-ARTHRITIC PROPERTIES. ON EVERY CONTINENT WHERE IT GROWS, STINGING NETTLE HAS
DEVELOPED A REPUTATION AS A TREATMENT FOR ARTHRITIS. THAT MIGHT BE A COINCIDENCE, BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE URTICATION A TRY, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MUCH PROBLEM LOCATING A PLANT. IT'S A COMMON WEED THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE COUNTRY. (SEE THE ILLUSTRATION ON PAGE 95-) IF YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW TO IDENTIFY IT, YOU'LL NEED TO ASK
SOMEONE IN THE KNOW; SOMEONE WHO WORKS AT A PLANT NURSERY OR YOUR LOCAL
COUNTY AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AGENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO HELP.
JOINTS IN TROUBLE
ARTHRITIS LITERALLY MEANS "JOINT INFLAMMATION." ACCORDING TO THE ARTHRITIS
FOUNDATION, THERE ARE MORE THAN 100 DIFFERENT DISEASES THAT PRODUCE JOINT PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION—EVERYTHING FROM THE FLU TO CERTAIN CANCERS. BUT WHEN PEOPLE
SAY "ARTHRITIS," THEY USUALLY MEAN OSTEOARTHRITIS.
ALSO KNOWN AS DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE, OSTEOARTHRITIS IS THE MOST PREVALENT OF MORE THAN A DOZEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF ARTHRITIS. SOME 16 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE IT. THE HIPS, KNEES, SPINE AND THE TINY JOINTS OF THE HANDS AND FEET
ARE MOST FREQUENTLY AFFECTED. OSTEOARTHRITIS USUALLY DEVELOPS GRADUALLY, BEGINNING WITH MINOR ACHES THAT EVENTUALLY LEAD TO EXTENDED PAIN, STIFFNESS, SWELLING
AND LIMITED RANGE OF MOTION. SYMPTOMS SOMETIMES SUBSIDE WITH GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BUT NOT ALWAYS.
ANOTHER COMMON FORM OF ARTHRITIS IS THE RHEUMATOID VARIETY. RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS (RA) HAS A NASTY REPUTATION BECAUSE IT CAN CAUSE CRIPPLING JOINT DEFORMITY. BUT MANY OF THE 2.1 MILLION AMERICANS WITH RA—APPROXIMATELY 75
PERCENT OF WHOM ARE WOMEN—HAVE MILDER, NONCRIPPLING CASES THAT FLARE UP
AND SUBSIDE MYSTERIOUSLY.
FREQUENTLY, BOTH HANDS ARE AFFECTED, BUT RA CAN STRIKE OTHER JOINTS AS WELL.
IN ADDITION TO JOINT PAIN, SWELLING AND WARMTH, POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE FATIGUE, FEVER, LOSS OF APPETITE, ENLARGED LYMPH NODES, LUMPS UNDER THE SKIN AND
MUSCLE STIFFNESS AFTER SLEEP OR INACTIVITY. STIFFNESS USUALLY SUBSIDES WITH MODERATE ACTIVITY.

ONE STUDY, INDIAN RESEARCHERS GAVE THREE TO SEVEN GRAMS (1½ TO 3½ TEASPOONS)
OF GINGER A DAY TO 18 PEOPLE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND
28 WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. MORE THAN 75 PERCENT
OF THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY REPORTED AT LEAST
SOME RELIEF FROM PAIN AND SWELLING. EVEN AFTER
MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF TAKING THESE HIGH DOSES OF
GINGER, NONE OF THE PEOPLE REPORTED SIDE EFFECTS.
THIS STUDY IS ONE REASON THAT JEAN CARPER, AUTHOR OF
FOOD: YOUR MIRACLE MEDICINE, DRINKS GINGER TEA FOR
HER OSTEOARTHRITIS.
THE CURCUMIN IN TURMERIC IS A CLOSE CHEMICAL
RELATIVE OF SOME COMPOUNDS FOUND IN GINGER, SO I'M
NOT SURPRISED THAT THIS HERB ALSO HAS A MAJOR REPUTATION AS AN ARTHRITIS TREATMENT.
YOU CAN ENJOY BOTH HERBS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF
SPICY DISHES AS WELL AS USE THEM TO MAKE TEAS.
V*^, PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). SOME INTRIGUING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT BROMELAIN, A CHEMICAL IN PINEAPPLE, HELPS PREVENT INFLAMMATION. FOR
SOME TIME NOW, ATHLETIC TRAINERS HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING PINEAPPLE TO ATHLETES TO PREVENT AND TREAT
SPORTS INJURIES. I THINK IT'S ALSO A GOOD BET FOR PEOPLE
WITH ARTHRITIS. BROMELAIN CAN HELP THE BODY GET RID
OF IMMUNE ANTIGEN COMPLEX, COMPOUNDS THAT ARE
IMPLICATED IN SOME ARTHRITIC CONDITIONS. IT ALSO
HELPS DIGEST FIBRIN, ANOTHER COMPOUND SUSPECTED OF
BEING INVOLVED IN SOME TYPES OF ARTHRITIS. IF YOU NEED AN EXCUSE TO INDULGE
YOURSELF WITH FRESH, RIPE PINEAPPLE, THIS IS IT.
W \ RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). RED PEPPER CAUSES
SOME PAIN ON THE TONGUE, BUT IRONICALLY, IT INTERFERES WITH PAIN PERCEPTION ELSEWHERE AROUND THE BODY. THE PAIN-RELIEVING CHEMICAL IN RED PEPPER, CAPSAICIN,
TRIGGERS THE BODY TO RELEASE ENDORPHINS, NATURE'S OWN OPIATES. RED PEPPER ALSO
CONTAINS ASPIRIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SALICYLATES.
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA BY MIXING RED PEPPER INTO WATER, BUT IT WOULD BE A
WHOLE LOT MORE PLEASURABLE TO HAVE YOUR RED PEPPER COOKED IN A VARIETY OF SPICY
DISHES. FOR A QUICK HIT, TRY A SPLASH OF HOT-PEPPER SAUCE IN TOMATO JUICE.
COMPOUNDS IN RED PEPPER CAN ALSO HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS WHEN YOU APPLY

THIS TREATMENT, THE CAPSAICIN CREAM REDUCED RA PAIN BY MORE THAN HALF. OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN WAS REDUCED BY ABOUT
ONE-THIRD.
CAPSAICIN CREAMS ARE GENERALLY
BELIEVED SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR ARTHRITIS.
LOOK FOR CAPSAICIN IN THE INGREDIENT
LIST OF OVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN CREAMS
SUCH AS ZOSTRIX OR CAPZASIN-P OR ASK
YOUR DOCTOR FOR A PRESCRIPTION CAPSAICIN PRODUCT. IF YOU USE A CAPSAICIN

THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD: YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET IT IN YOUR EYES. ALSO, SINCE SOME
PEOPLE ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS COMPOUND, YOU SHOULD TEST IT ON A SMALL
AREA OF SKIN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S OKAY
FOR YOU TO USE BEFORE USING IT ON A
LARGER AREA. IF IT SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOUR
SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.
VVV STINGING NETTLE (URTICA
DIOICA). BEYOND STINGING PAINFUL
JOINTS, THERE'S ANOTHER METHOD OF USING
THIS HERB TO TREAT ARTHRITIS—STEAMING
THE FRESH LEAVES AND ENJOYING THEM AS
A VEGETABLE. YOU'LL BE RELIEVED TO KNOW
THAT ALTHOUGH YOU DO HAVE TO WEAR
GLOVES TO HARVEST THE LEAVES, THE FUZZY
STINGERS LOSE THEIR STING WHEN THE LEAVES ARE COOKED.
THE RHEUMATOID DISEASE FOUNDATION SUGGESTS THAT THREE MILLIGRAMS OF
BORON, TAKEN DAILY, MAY BE HELPFUL IN TREATING OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RA. AN
ANALYSIS OF STINGING NETTLE PROVIDED TO ME BY USDA SCIENTISTS SHOWS THAT THIS
HERB CONTAINS 47 PARTS PER MILLION OF THE MINERAL BORON, FIGURED ON A DRY-WEIGHT
BASIS. THAT MEANS THAT A 100-GRAM SERVING OF STINGING NETTLE, EASILY PREPARED
BY STEAMING SEVERAL OUNCES OF YOUNG, TENDER LEAVES, COULD EASILY CONTAIN MORE
THAN THE RECOMMENDED THREE MILLIGRAMS OF BORON. (YOU CAN ALSO GET A GOOD PORMUHI-MINT ANTIOXIDANT

ROSEMARY AND OREGANO ARE BOTH ANTIOXIDANT MINTS. ADD SEVERAL MORE ANTIOXIDANT

LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA), MARJORAM, OREGANO, PEPPERMINT, ROSEMARY,

THESE HERBS CONTAIN PROVEN ANTI-ARTHRITIC

WHILE MARJORAM, OREGANO AND ROSEMARY
WEIGHED IN WITH A FEW EACH.
HOW MUCH OF EACH HERB SHOULD YOU

ACCORDING TO THE RHEUMATOID DISEASE FOUNDATION, BORON IS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT PLAYS A ROLE IN HELPING BONES RETAIN CALCIUM. IT ALSO HAS A BENEFICIAL
INFLUENCE ON THE BODY'S ENDOCRINE (HORMONAL) SYSTEM, AND HORMONES PLAY A ROLE
IN HELPING THE BODY MAINTAIN HEALTHY BONES AND JOINTS.
VV OREGANO {ORIGANUM VULGARE). STUDIES ARE ACCUMULATING THAT THE
"PIZZA HERB," OREGANO, IS A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT. LIKE OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS CONTAINED IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, THE COMPOUNDS IN OREGANO MAY HELP PREVENT
THE CELL DAMAGE CAUSED BY FREE RADICALS—HIGHLY UNSTABLE OXYGEN MOLECULES
THAT STEAL ELECTRONS FROM OTHER MOLECULES THEY ENCOUNTER. FREE RADICAL REACTIONS ARE PROBABLY INVOLVED IN INFLAMMATION, DEGENERATIVE ARTHRITIS AND THE
AGING PROCESS IN GENERAL. AND EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING THAT ANTIOXIDANTS MAY
HELP RELIEVE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RA.
IN A TEST OF NEARLYLOO PLANTS IN THE MINT FAMILY, OF WHICH OREGANO IS A
MEMBER, THE PIZZA HERB WAS THE ONE THAT HAD THE GREATEST TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF OREGANO AND OTHER
MEDICINAL MINTS IS DUE IN LARGE PART TO ROSMARINIC ACID, A COMPOUND WITH ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTIVIRAL PROPERTIES. CONSIDERING HOW HIGHLY IT RANKS FOR THIS KIND OF PROTECTION, OREGANO IS DEFINITELY WORTH
ADDING TO YOUR PIZZA, OR ANY OTHER FOOD, IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS. YOU COULD ALSO TRY
MY MULTI-MINT ANTIOXIDANT ARTHRITIS TEA.
W WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES), GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND
LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). WILLOW BARK WAS THE ORIGINAL HERBAL ASPIRIN.
IT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL CALLED SALICIN* WHICH THE BAYER COMPANY EVENTUALLY
TRANSFORMED INTO LITTLE WHITE TABLETS OF ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID—THE PAINKILLING
DRUG CALLED ASPIRIN THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS TAKE DAILY.
WILLOW BARK TEA HAS PAIN-RELIEVING AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS SIMILAR
TO THOSE OF ASPIRIN. BUT BECAUSE THE IRRITATION-CAUSING INGREDIENT IN ASPIRIN
TABLETS IS DILUTED IN TEA, YOU'LL HAVE LESS RISK OF STOMACH UPSET, ULCER AND OVERI DOSE IF YOU TAKE THE TEA INSTEAD OF THE PILLS.
, STILL, WILLOW BARK MIGHT UPSET YOUR STOMACH. THAT'S WHY I'VE INCLUDED
LICORICE IN THIS FORMULA. NOT ONLY DOES LICORICE HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS,
IT MAY ALSO HELP TREAT ANY GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE WILLOW.
' BUT THE FORMULA IS NOT QUITE COMPLETE WITHOUT GARLIC. WHILE LONG-TERM USE
OR INGESTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF LICORICE CAN RAISE SOME PEOPLE'S BLOOD PRES-
• SURE AND LEAD TO OTHER PROBLEMS (HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM), GARLIC HELPS REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE. SO HERE'S
THE FORMULA FOR A WELL-BALANCED ANTI-ARTHRITIS TEA: APPROXIMATELY THREE PARTS
DRIED WILLOW BARK, TWO PARTS DRIED LICORICE ROOT AND ONE PART MINCED GARLIC.

POUR BOILING WATER OVER THE MIXTURE
AND STEEP FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. IF YOU
DON'T LIKE THE TASTE, ADD LEMON AND/OR
HONEY, PLUS GINGER AND TURMERIC TO
TASTE.
V BRAZIL NUT (BERTHOLETTIA EXCELSA) AND SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS
ANNUUS). SAM IS SHORTHAND FOR
S-ADENOSYL-METHIONINE, A CHEMICAL
SHOWN TO HAVE PAIN-RELIEVING AND ANTIINFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO
THOSE FOUND IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER
MEDICATION IBUPROFEN.
SAM CAN BE FOUND IN HIGH-METHIONINE SEEDS AND NUTS, PARTICULARLY SUNFLOWER SEEDS AND BRAZIL NUTS. IT WOULD
TAKE 250 GRAMS OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS
(ABOUT 9 OUNCES) OR 500 GRAMS OF BRAZIL
NUTS (18 OUNCES) TO PROVIDE A DOSE OF
SAM THAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A STANDARD DOSE OF IBUPROFEN. IT'S NOT FEASIBLE
TO EAT THAT MANY NUTS AND SEEDS, BUT I
BELIEVE THAT EVERY LITDE BIT HELPS, ESPEJ CIALLY IF YOU USE THE OTHER NATURAL APPROACHES THIS CHAPTER RECOMMENDS.
SO GO AHEAD AND SPRINKLE SOME SUNFLOWER SEEDS ON YOUR SALAD. AND WHEN
YOU'RE NIBBLING MIXED NUTS IN COMPANY, DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR MONOPOLIZING THE
BRAZIL NUTS.
V BROCCOLI (BRASSICA OLERACEA) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING GLUTATHIONE. STUDIES INDICATE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW IN THE ANTIOXIDANT COMPOUND GLUTATHIONE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ARTHRITIS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE HIGHER
AMOUNTS.
VEGETABLES RICH IN GLUTATHIONE INCLUDE ASPARAGUS, CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER,
POTATOES, TOMATOES AND PURSLANE. FRUITS WITH HEALTHY AMOUNTS INCLUDE AVOCADOS, GRAPEFRUIT, ORANGES, PEACHES AND WATERMELON.
V ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). ROSEMARY WAS KNOWN IN ANTIQUITY AS THE HERB OF REMEMBRANCE. I FIND THAT QUITE FITTING, SINCE ROSEMARY HAS
ANTIOXIDANTS THAT HELP PREVENT AGING IN CELLS, AND THE AGING PROCESS IS CERTAINLY
ASSOCIATED WITH MEMORY LOSS. ONE GREEK-AMERICAN HERB GROWER TELLS HOW HER
ARIIHIFFIS BROTH
TO MAKE THIS BROTH, BEGIN WITH A COUPLE OF
CUPS OF WATER AND ADD RED PEPPER, BURDOCK, BLACK PEPPER, CELERY SEED, DANDELION, GARLIC, GINGER, HORSERADISH, JUNIPER,
LEMONGRASS, OREGANO, PARSLEY, SARSAPARILLA,
THYME, TURMERIC, VALERIAN, WATERCRESS,
WHITE MUSTARD AND WILLOW BARK. BRING TO A
BOIL, THEN TURN DOWN THE HEAT AND SIMMER
FOR A FEW MINUTES.
I CONFESS THAT I HAVE NEVER MADE THIS
BROTH IN ITS ENTIRETY. I JUST OPPORTUNISTICALLY
SEIZE ANY OF THESE INGREDIENTS THAT ARE NEAR
AT HAND. IF YOU PRESS ME FOR A RECIPE, I'D
SAY USE FOUR DASHES EACH OF BURDOCK, DANDELION, PARSLEY, TURMERIC AND WATERCRESS;
TWO DASHES OF CELERY SEED, GARLIC, GINGER
AND OREGANO; AND ONE DASH EACH OF THE
OTHERS, AS AVAILABLE. THIS MIGHT BE TOO
SPICY FOR YOUR TASTE, BUT IF SO, YOU HAVE MY
PERMISSION TO ALTER THE RECIPE TO SUIT YOUR
OWN TASTE.

ASTHM A
FISHING RELATIVES SET OUT TO SEA WITH FISH DISHES HEAVILY COVERED WITH ROSEMARY.
EVEN WHEN IT WAS UNREFRIGERATED, THIS FOOD LASTED FOR DAYS, THANKS IN PART TO THE
ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF THE ROSEMARY.
CAN AN HERB THAT KEEPS FISH FROM SPOILING HELP PRESERVE YOUR YOUTH? THE
JURY IS STILL OUT ON THAT ONE, BUT ROSEMARY HAS PRESERVATIVE POWERS COMPARABLE
TO THE COMMERCIAL PRESERVATIVES BHA AND BHT. AND SINCE WE KNOW THAT ANTIOXIDANTS DO HELP TREAT ARTHRITIS, IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS ANTIOXIDANT-RICH HERB
WOULD HELP THWART THIS DISEASE.
V VITAMIN C. VITAMIN C INHIBITS THE PROGRESSION OF OSTEOARTHRITIS IN
GUINEA PIGS. DOES IT WORK IN HUMANS? THERE'S NO PROOF YET THAT IT DOES, BUT IT
CERTAINLY CAN'T HURT TO GET MORE VITAMIN C. RED PEPPER AND MANY OF THE OTHER
HERBS AND VEGETABLES MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER CONTAIN GOOD AMOUNTS.
ASTHMA
MARTHA WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE—A TALL, PRETTY, FREE-SPIRITED
WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES WHO WORKED AS A TECHNICIAN WITH ME IN THE
MEDICINAL PLANTS RESEARCH LABORATORY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
(USDA). WE WERE BOTH INVOLVED WITH THE JOINT USD A/NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE PLANT-SCREENING PROGRAM, LOOKING FOR PLANTS WITH ANTI-CANCER POTENTIAL.
MARTHA LOVED TO HIKE IN THE WOODS, AND WE OCCASIONALLY HIKED TOGETHER. I
CAN SEE HER NOW, WORKING HAPPILY IN MY GINSENG PATCH IN BIG, TALL COWBOY
BOOTS. I WOULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO DIE EACH YEAR OF ASTHMA.
ASTHMA TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY
ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC RESPIRATORY AILMENT THAT CAUSES WHEEZING, COUGHING,
CHEST CONGESTION, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND OFTEN TREMENDOUS ANXIETY ABOUT
BEING UNABLE TO BREATHE.
MORE THAN 4,000 PEOPLE DIE EACH YEAR FROM COMPLICATIONS OF SERIOUS
ASTHMA ATTACKS, A NUMBER THAT'S INCREASED OVER 30 PERCENT SINCE 1980. FOR REASONS THAT REMAIN UNEXPLAINED, CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN SUMMER, WHILE
PEOPLE OVER 65 ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN WINTER.

THE COLTSFOOT CONTROVERSY
COLTSFOOT (TUSSILAGO FARFARA) HAS BEEN A
\ FOLK FAVORITE FOR ASTHMA AND COUGHS FOR
' CENTURIES. ITS GENERIC NAME, TUSSILAGO,
I COMES FROM THE LATIN FOR "COUGH " AND THIS
•) HERB DOES INDEED CONTAIN SOME COM-
•$ POUNDS PROVEN EFFECTIVE AGAINST COUGH AND
? ASTHMA.
•I COLTSFOOT HAS EXPECTORANT ACTIVITY. IN
\ OTHER WORDS, IT STIMULATES THE MICRO-
; SCOPIC HAIRS THAT MOVE MUCUS OUT OF THE
AIR PASSAGES. AND LIKE GARLIC AND GINKGO,
\ IT SUPPRESSES THE BODY'S PRODUCTION OF
} PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR, A PROTEIN IN THE
* BLOOD THAT PLAYS A ROLE IN TRIGGERING
I BRONCHOSPASMS, THE NARROWING OF THE AIR
< PASSAGES THAT CAUSES ASTHMA SYMPTOMS.
\ BUT IN RECENT YEARS, COLTSFOOT HAS
BECOME CONTROVERSIAL. THIS HERB CONTAINS
I PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS (PAS), CHEMICALS
THAT ARE TOXIC AND/OR CARCINOGENIC TO THE
¾. LIVER. MANY HERBALISTS, AND MORE
I BOTANISTS, WANTING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF
I CAUTION, RECOMMEND AGAINST TAKING HERBS
I THAT CONTAIN PAS. THE PRIMARY HERBS TO
? BE CONCERNED ABOUT ARE COLTSFOOT AND
: COMFREY.
ON THE OTHER HAND, DATA PUBLISHED
IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE BY NOTED BIO-
• CHEMIST BRUCE AMES, PH.D., OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY, WOULD
: INDICATE THAT COMFREY LEAF TEA IS LESS CAR-
; CINOGENIC THAN AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF
'•? BEER. OFFICIALLY, I'D HAVE TO SAY DON'T INGEST COLTSFOOT OR COMFREY. BUT PRIVATELY,

, OF COMFREY OR COLTSFOOT TEA, JUST AS I DRINK
AN OCCASIONAL BEER. L .
MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER ASTHMA A
CHILDHOOD ILLNESS, AND THERE'S CERTAINLY
NO SHORTAGE OF KIDS WITH THIS DISEASE. IN
1995, SOME 3.7 MILLION CHILDREN AND
ADOLESCENTS HAD IT, UP SHARPLY FROM 2.4
MILLION IN 1980. BUT ASTHMA CAN DEVELOP AT ANY AGE, AND THE FACT IS, MOST
PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA ARE ADULTS. ABOUT
14 MILLION AMERICANS NOW HAVE
ASTHMA. THE DISEASE COSTS US MORE THAN
$6 BILLION A YEAR IN MEDICAL CARE AND
LOST PRODUCTIVITY.
DOCTORS SAY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAUSES ASTHMA OR WHY THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT KEEPS RISING.
NEITHER DO I. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE
CLOSER WE GET TO CHEMICAL POLLUTION AND
THE FARTHER WE STRAY FROM NATURAL FOODS,
THE MORE ASTHMA WE SEE. I BELIEVE THAT
OUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION AND "SICK BUILDINGS" WITH INDOOR POLLUTION ARE A BIG
PART OF THE GROWING ASTHMA PROBLEM.
THE SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA ARE
CAUSED BY BRONCHIAL SPASMS (BRONCHOSPASMS), A SUDDEN NARROWING OF THE
BRANCHING TUBES THAT LEAD INTO THE
LUNGS. WHILE ASTHMA AND HAY
FEVER—TYPE ALLERGIES ARE DISTINCT CONDITIONS, THEY OVERLAP, ESPECIALLY AMONG
THOSE UNDER AGE 15. NINETY PERCENT OF
CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA ALSO HAVE ALLERGIES, AND THESE ALLERGIES CAN TRIGGER
ASTHMA ATTACKS.
THE REASON THAT BRONCHOSPASMS
CAN BE TRIGGERED BY ALLERGIES IS THAT
HISTAMINE, THE CHEMICAL MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLERGY SYMPTOMS, SEEMS TO
PLAY A ROLE IN ASTHMA ATTACKS AS WELL.
62
ASTHM A
BUT MANY OTHER THINGS BESIDES HISTAMINE CAN TRIGGER AN ATTACK: STRENUOUS EXERCISE, CIGARETTE SMOKE, RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS, INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS, ASPIRIN,
PET DANDER, INDOOR POLLUTION AND THE SULFITES ADDED TO MANY FOODS.
STRESS ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN ASTHMA. SEVERE ANXIETY CAN TRIGGER ATTACKS, AND
STRESS GENERALLY AGGRAVATES ASTHMA SYMPTOMS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ASTHMA
DOCTORS TREAT ASTHMA WITH A VARIETY OF DRUGS—AMONG THEM, THEOPHYLLINE
(AEROLATE, THEO-DUR)—THAT OPEN UP THE BRONCHIAL TUBES. THESE DRUGS, KNOWN
AS BRONCHODILATORS, ARE OFTEN TAKEN WITH AN INHALER.
IF I HAD ASTHMA, I'D CERTAINLY FOLLOW A PHYSICIAN'S RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS
IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL ILLNESS. BUT FOR MY TREATMENT, IF MY DOCTOR SUGGESTED THEOPHYLLINE, I'D PREFER TO GET IT FROM ITS MANY NATURAL SOURCES, CHIEF AMONG THEM
THE PLANTS CONTAINING CAFFEINE.
W V COFFEE, TEA, CAFFEINATED COLA DRINKS, COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. ALL
OF THESE POPULAR BEVERAGES, AS WELL AS CHOCOLATE CANDY, ARE DERIVED FROM PLANTS
AND COUNT AS HERBAL PRODUCTS. AND ALL CONTAIN CAFFEINE AS WELL AS OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT MAY HELP FEND OFF ASTHMA.
JOE GRAEDON, THE PHARMACIST AND SYNDICATED NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST, ONCE
WROTE IN HIS COLUMN THAT IN A PINCH, IF CAUGHT WITHOUT THEIR MEDICATION, PEOPLE
WITH ASTHMA COULD DRINK A FEW CUPS OF COFFEE, WHICH IS A POTENT BRONCHODILATOR.
SOME MONTHS LATER HE RECEIVED A THANK-YOU NOTE FROM A NEWLYWED WOMAN WITH
ASTHMA WHO FORGOT HER MEDICATION ON HER HAWAIIAN HONEYMOON. AT ONE POINT
SHE STARTED WHEEZING, REALIZED SHE'D FORGOTTEN HER DRUGS AND BECAME PANICKY,
WHICH MADE HER WHEEZING WORSE. THEN SHE REMEMBERED THE COLUMN ADVOCATING
COFFEE AS A WORKABLE SUBSTITUTE. SHE QUICKLY DRANK THREE CUPS. HER WHEEZING
SUBSIDED, SAVING HER HONEYMOON AND POSSIBLY HER LIFE.
ACTUALLY, COFFEE, TEA, CAFFEINATED COLA DRINKS, COCOA AND CHOCOLATE HAVE
MORE THAN CAFFEINE. ALL REPORTEDLY CONTAIN TWO OTHER MAJOR NATURAL ANTI-ASTHMATIC COMPOUNDS, THEOBROMINE AND THEOPHYLLINE, WHICH, ALONG WITH CAFFEINE,
BELONG TO A FAMILY OF CHEMICALS CALLED XANTHINES. THESE CHEMICALS HELP STOP
BRONCHOSPASMS AND OPEN CONSTRICTED BRONCHIAL PASSAGES.
LEVELS OF THESE ANTI-ASTHMATIC COMPOUNDS VARY, DEPENDING ON THE STRENGTH
OF THE BREW AND OTHER FACTORS. BUT IN GENERAL, A CUP OF COFFEE HAS THE HIGHEST
LEVELS (ABOUT 100 MILLIGRAMS OF CAFFEINE PER CUP), WHILE A CUP OF TEA OR COCOA OR
A 12-OUNCE CAN OF COLA HAS ABOUT HALF THAT AMOUNT. A L'/2-OUNCE CHOCOLATE BAR
HAS A LITTLE LESS THAN A CAN OF COLA.
63
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
OF COURSE, CAFFEINE AND THE OTHER ANTI-ASTHMATIC XANTHINES ARE NOT ENTIRELY
RISK-FREE. AS ANY JAVA JUNKIE KNOWS, CAFFEINE CAN CAUSE INSOMNIA AND THE JITTERS. BUT IN THEIR NATURAL STATE, THE ANTI-ASTHMATIC COMPOUNDS ACTUALLY CAUSE
FEWER SIDE EFFECTS THAN PHARMACEUTICAL THEOPHYLLINE.
IN ONE SURVEY, 81 PERCENT OF PEDIATRICIANS SAID THAT PARENTS HAD EXPRESSED
CONCERNS ABOUT THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THEIR CHILDREN'S ASTHMA MEDICATION, PARTICULARLY THE RESTLESSNESS AND DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING THAT MANY CHILDREN EXPERIENCE. AT HIGH DOSES, PHARMACEUTICAL ASTHMA MEDICATIONS MAY ALSO CAUSE
HEADACHE, INSOMNIA, IRRITABILITY, NAUSEA, POOR APPETITE, STOMACHACHE AND EVEN
SEIZURES.
AT THIS POINT, THOUGH, FD LIKE TO MAKE MYSELF CRYSTAL CLEAR: IF I WERE
PLAGUED BY LIFE-THREATENING ASTHMA, FD LISTEN TO MY PHYSICIAN AND TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS, AND I'D USE NATURAL APPROACHES ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL TREATMENTS.
W V EPHEDR A (EPHEDRA SINICA). MANY MEDICAL BOTANISTS SAY THAT
EPHEDRA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST MEDICINES. THE CHINESE, WHO CALL IT MA
HUANG, HAVE USED THIS HERB FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO TREAT ASTHMA AND OTHER
RESPIRATORY AILMENTS.
SCIENTISTS ISOLATED ITS ACTIVE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS, EPHEDRINE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, IN 1887. IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER WORLD WAR I, HOWEVER, THAT AMERICAN DOCTORS STARTED PRESCRIBING THESE SUBSTANCES. AT THAT TIME, DOCTORS BECAME
AWARE OF THE CHEMICALS' EFFECTS AS BRONCHODILATORS, NASAL DECONGESTANTS AND
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULANTS. PSEUDOEPHEDRINE HAS SINCE BECOME A
COMMON OVER-THE-COUNTER DECONGESTANT. THE CHEMICAL INSPIRED THE BRAND
NAME SUDAFED.
WHOLE EPHEDRA—AS WELL AS ITS CHEMICAL COMPONENTS EPHEDRINE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE—HAS SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, RESTLESSNESS AND POSSIBLY AGGRAVATION OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS
HERB. IN FACT, IF YOU TAKE REALLY HIGH DOSES, VERY STRANGE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. THE
MEDICAL LITERATURE CONTAINS 20 CASE REPORTS OF EPHEDRINE PSYCHOSIS, AND THE
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CURB THE DISTRIBUTION AND
SALE OF EPHEDRINE SUPPLEMENTS.
STILL, IF YOU ARE CAREFUL, THIS HERB IS VERY USEFUL IN MANAGING ASTHMA. YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER MAKING A TEA WITH THE DRIED HERB INSTEAD OF TAKING THE OVER-THECOUNTER DRUGS THAT CONTAIN THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS. TO MAKE A TEA, USE A LEVEL
TEASPOON OF EPHEDRA OR A HALF-TEASPOON TO ONE TEASPOON OF TINCTURE FROM A
HEALTH FOOD STORE OR PHARMACY.
BECAUSE OF EPHEDRA'S STIMULANT EFFECT, SOME EPHEDRA/MA HUANG PRODUCTS
ARE SOLD AS "ENERGY FORMULAS." IN FACT, OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, SEVERAL PEOPLE
HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF ABUSING THIS HERB. BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE STIMULANT
64
ASTHM A
PROPERTIES, I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST USING EPHEDRA TO TREAT ASTHMA IN CHILDREN
UNLESS YOU FIRST DISCUSS IT WITH THE CHILD'S PEDIATRICIAN.
VVV STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO, THE BRITISH
HERBALIST NICHOLAS CULPEPER CLAIMED THAT NETTLE ROOTS OR LEAVES, USED IN JUICE OR
TEA, WERE "SAFE AND SURE MEDICINES TO OPEN THE PIPES AND PASSAGES OF THE LUNGS."
FOR MANY YEARS, AUSTRALIANS HAVE VIEWED NETTLE AS A GOOD TREATMENT FOR
ASTHMA. AUSSIES DRINK THE JUICE OF THE ROOTS AND LEAVES MIXED WITH HONEY OR
SUGAR, AND THEY FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT RELIEVES BRONCHIAL TROUBLES. BUT AMERICANS
DIDN'T CATCH ON UNTIL A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN A SCIENTIFIC STUDY
WAS PUBLISHED SHOWING THAT NETTLE IS A POTENT ANTIHISTAMINE. NOW NETTLE IS INCREASINGLY RECOMMENDED FOR HAY FEVER AND ASTHMA. FRIENDS WITH ALLERGIES AND
ASTHMA VISIT MY GARDEN REGULARLY TO DIG UP MY NETTLE PATCH. (YOU'LL NEED TO WEAR
GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING STINGING NETTLE LEAVES, BUT THE STINGING HAIRS LOSE THEIR
STING WHEN THE LEAVES ARE COOKED.)
W ANISE (PIMPINELLA ANISUM) AND FENNEL (FOENICULUM VULGARE).
THE GREEKS USE TEAS MADE FROM THESE HERBS FOR ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY
AILMENTS. THEY BOTH CONTAIN HELPFUL CHEMICALS—CREOSOL AND ALPHA-PINENE—
THAT HELP LOOSEN BRONCHIAL SECRETIONS.
FENNEL SEEDS (ACTUALLY FRUITS) CAN CONTAIN AS MUCH AS 8,800 PARTS PER MILLION
(PPM) OF ALPHA-PINENE. IRONICALLY,
DESPITE ITS TRADITIONAL USE FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, ANISE IS NO SUPERSTAR. IT
HAS ONLY 360 PPM OF ALPHA-PINENE.
MANY OTHER PLANTS ARE GOOD
SOURCES AND COULD BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ASTHMA RELIEF. IN DESCENDING
ORDER, THEY ARE PARSLEY SEED, CORIANDER,
JUNIPER BERRIES, SWEET ANNIE, CARDAMOM, SASSAFRAS, HORSEBALM, GINGER,
CHINESE ANGELICA (ALSO KNOWN AS DANGQUAI), DILL, TARRAGON AND YARROW. YOU
COULD MIX UP A PRETTY GOOD ASTHMA TEA
WITH ANY OR SEVERAL OF THESE, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU ADDED A LITTLE LICORICE.
VV LICORICE (QLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE TEA SOOTHES THE THROAT AND IS
OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR SORE THROAT, COUGH AND ASTHMA. LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS
ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS A DAY.
HOWEVER, LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE
FENNEL
ALSO KNOWN ASFINOCCHIO, THIS HERB
IS IN THE SAME PLANT FAMILY AS
CARROTS AND PARSLEY.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
IF YOU DECIDE TO USE LICORICE STEADILY TO MANAGE ASTHMA, OPT FOR DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED LICORICE EXTRACTS (DGLE), WHICH CAUSE FEWER PROBLEMS. THERE ARE
MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER PREPARATIONS OF DGLE, ESPECIALLY OVERSEAS. YOU CAN
FIND THEM IN AMERICA, HOWEVER. I USE LICORICE (MODESDY), ESPECIALLY DURING SEVERE EPISODES OF STRESS, BY USING A PIECE OF DRIED ROOT TO STIR MY HERB TEAS.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). ASIAN HEALERS HAVE USED EXTRACTS OF GINKGO
LEAVES FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO TREAT ASTHMA, ALLERGIES, BRONCHITIS AND COUGHS.
GINKGO HAS BECOME POPULAR IN THE WEST BECAUSE OF ITS BENEFITS FOR THE ELDERLY:
INCREASED BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN AND TREATMENT OF STROKE AND OTHER INFIRMITIES
OF OLD AGE. BUT IN CHINA, IT'S STILL WIDELY USED FOR ASTHMA.
GINKGO WORKS BECAUSE IT INTERFERES WITH PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR, A PROTEIN IN THE BLOOD THAT PLAYS A ROLE IN TRIGGERING BRONCHOSPASMS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN GINKGO—GINKGOLIDES—ARE PRESENT IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN THE TREE'S LEAVES. TO GET ONE REASONABLE DOSE
OF MEDICINE, A PERSON WITH ASTHMA WOULD HAVE TO EAT ABOUT 50 FRESH LEAVES. I
EAT A LOT OF PLANTS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T TOUCH, BUT NOT EVEN I WOULD EAT
THAT MANY GINKGO LEAVES.
THE BEST WAY TO TAKE THIS HERB IS TO BUY A 50:1 EXTRACT (50 POUNDS OF LEAVES
YIELDS 1 POUND OF EXTRACT). HEALTH FOOD STORES AND SOME PHARMACIES CARRY
GINKGO EXTRACTS. FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE
AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
V TOMATO (LYCOPERSICON LYCOPERSICUM), CITRUS FRUITS AND OTHER
FOODS CONTAINING VITAMIN C. A REVIEW OF SOME 40 GOOD STUDIES REVEALED THAT
VITAMIN C—ABOUT 1,000 MILLIGRAMS A DAY—HELPS PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS, BRONCHOSPASMS, WHEEZING, RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS, NASAL CONGESTION, WATERY EYES AND
OTHER ALLERGY SYMPTOMS. WHY? VITAMIN C INHIBITS THE RELEASE OF HISTAMINE.
I ADVISE EATING MORE PLANTS THAT ARE HIGH IN VITAMIN C—NOT JUST CITRUS
FRUITS AND TOMATOES BUT ALSO BELL PEPPERS AND STRAWBERRIES. YOU CAN ALSO TAKE A
SUPPLEMENT. THE BEAUTY OF EATING CITRUS FRUITS, HOWEVER, IS THAT IN ADDITION TO
VITAMIN C, THEY ALSO CONTAIN FLAVONOIDS. THESE ARE SUBSTANCES THAT ALSO BLOCK
THE RELEASE OF HISTAMINE, IN TURN CURBING ALLERGY SYMPTOMS AND ALLERGY-RELATED
ASTHMA.
V ASSORTED HERBS. I SEARCHED MY DATABASE FOR ANTI-ASTHMATIC COMPOUNDS AND CAME UP WITH QUITE A FEW HERBS WORTH MENTIONING. I FOUND AT LEAST
SIX ANTI-ASTHMATIC SUBSTANCES IN TEA, FENNEL AND CAYENNE. ONION, CORIANDER AND
BELL PEPPER HAD FIVE. AND A LARGE GROUP CONTAINED FOUR: CABBAGE, CACAO, CARROT,
66
ATHLETE'S FOO T
CRANBERRY, CURRANT, EGGPLANT, GRAPEFRUIT, ORANGE, OREGANO, SAGE AND TOMATO.
LOOKING FOR HERBS WITH THE LARGEST AMOUNTS OF ANTI-ASTHMA COMPOUNDS, I
FOUND THAT LICORICE AND TEA WERE THE BIG WINNERS. CACAO, CARDAMOM, COFFEE,
COLA, ONION AND PURSLANE LOOKED RELATIVELY RICH.
YOU COULD WHIP UP SOME INTERESTING ANTI-ASTHMA DISHES WITH THESE HERBS.
HOW ABOUT ORANGE-GRAPEFRUIT-CRANBERRY FRUIT SALAD WITH FENNEL? OR EGGPLANT
WITH ONION, TOMATO AND SAGE?
FINALLY, JAPANESE WASABI IS WORTH A TRY. THE JAPANESE ENJOY WASABI JUST AS
AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS ENJOY HORSERADISH. IT CERTAINLY CLEARS THE SINUSES.
THERE'S SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTING THAT A SPOONFUL A DAY CAN RELIEVE ALLERGIES,
ESPECIALLY HAY FEVER. THIS TELLS ME THAT IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR MANAGING ASTHMA
AS WELL.
IF I HAD ASTHMA, FD TRY WASABI. YOU CAN BUY IT AT ANY GROCERY STORE THAT CARRIES A SPECIALTY LINE OF ORIENTAL PRODUCTS. YOU CAN USE IT JUST AS YOU WOULD
HORSERADISH. TRY SPREADING IT ON CRACKERS OR MIXING IT IN A DIP, OR HAVE IT WITH
SUSHI, AS THE JAPANESE DO.
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE, HOWEVER, THAT WASABI IS EXTREMELY HOT. IF YOU DON'T
ENJOY HOT FOODS, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER USING THIS AS AN ASTHMA TREATMENT.
V VITAMIN B6. MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND AUTHOR OF SEVERAL BOOKS ON ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, CITES CASES OF CHILDREN WITH
ASTHMA WHO REDUCED THEIR DOSAGES OF ANTI-ASTHMA MEDICATIONS—BRONCHODILATORS AND STEROIDS—BY TAKING A DAILY DOSE OF 200 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN B6 IN ADDITION TO THEIR MEDICATION. ADULTS HAVE EXPERIENCED DECREASED FREQUENCY AND
INTENSITY OF ASTHMA ATTACKS BY TAKING 50 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN B6 TWICE DAILY.
THE DAILY VALUE FOR B6 IS ONLY 2 MILLIGRAMS, AND UNUSUALLY LARGE DOSES MAY
DAMAGE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. IF I HAD ASTHMA, FD PROBABLY TRY B6, BUT IF YOU WANT
TO TAKE B6 SUPPLEMENTS OR GIVE THEM TO YOUR CHILD, DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
ATMETE'S FOOT
Y
OU MIGHT NOT THINK GOING BAREFOOT IS A HEALING REMEDY, BUT IT IS. TO
PREVENT AND TREAT ATHLETE'S FOOT, DOCTORS OFTEN RECOMMEND KEEPING THE
FEET DRY BY GOING SOCKLESS AND WEARING OPEN-TOED SHOES. I HAVE AN EVEN BETTER
APPROACH: I SUGGEST A BAREFOOT WEEKEND AT A SALT-WATER BEACH.
I PERSONALLY PRACTICE THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF THERAPY AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE.
IN FACT, STRANGE AS THIS MAY SOUND, I EVEN GO BAREFOOT IN THE JUNGLES OF AMA67
CHOOSIN G TH E HERBS THA T HEA L
ZONIAN PERU. AND I MANAGE TO STAY FREE OF THE FUNGAL SKIN INFECTION KNOWN AS
ATHLETE'S FOOT.
ATHLETE'S FOOT, MEDICALLY KNOWN AS TINEA PEDIS, IS A SUPERFICIAL FUNGAL INFECTION. THE FUNGI (ANY OF SEVERAL SPECIES) CAN INFECT NOT ONLY THE FEET BUT ALSO
OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THE FORM OF TINEA CORPORIS, COMMONLY CALLED RINGWORM. AND WHEN THE FUNGUS GETS TO THE GROIN OR THIGH, IT'S CALLED TINEA CRURIS, OR
JOCK ITCH (WHICH WOMEN CAN GET EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T WEAR JOCKS).
ATHLETE'S FOOT FUNGUS NEEDS MOISTURE AND DARKNESS TO GROW. THAT'S WHY BOTH
CONVENTIONAL DOCTORS AND ALTERNATIVE PRACTITIONERS RECOMMEND KEEPING THE FEET
DRY. AND OF COURSE, YOUR FEET ARE DRIER IF YOU GO AROUND BAREFOOT RATHER THAN
KEEPING YOUR TOES ALL TRAPPED AND HUMID IN DARK, CLOSED SHOES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT
IF MY MAIN FORM OF PREVENTION—GOING BAREFOOT—EVER STOPS WORKING FOR
ME AND I EXPERIENCE BURNING, ITCHING AND CRACKING SKIN BETWEEN MY TOES, I'M
READY: MY HERBAL VINEYARD IN MARYLAND IS LOADED WITH POWERFUL ANTIFUNGAL
HERBS. HERE ARE THE ONES I RECOMMEND FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT.
V W GARLIC {ALLIUM SATIVUM). THIS IS MY FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT. IT'S ONE
OF THE MOST WIDELY RECOMMENDED ANTIFUNGAL ANTISEPTICS, AND FOR GOOD REASON.
MANY SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS STUDIES SHOW THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE IN TREATING ATHLETE'S
FOOT AND OTHER FUNGAL INFECTIONS, NOTABLY VAGINAL YEAST INFECTIONS.
A GARLIC FOOTBATH MIGHT BE MALODOROUS, BUT IT USUALLY RELIEVES ITCHING AND
BURNING BETWEEN THE TOES. I SUGGEST PUTTING SEVERAL CRUSHED GARLIC CLOVES IN A
BASIN WITH WARM WATER AND A LITTLE RUBBING ALCOHOL.
IF THIS APPROACH DOESN'T APPEAL TO YOU, CONSIDER THE TRADITIONAL CHINESE
APPROACH: CRUSH SEVERAL CLOVES OF GARLIC AND STEEP THEM IN OLIVE OIL FOR ONE TO
THREE DAYS. STRAIN OUT THE PLANT MATERIAL AND USE A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH TO
APPLY THE GARLIC OIL BETWEEN YOUR TOES ONCE OR TWICE A DAY.
SOME HERBALISTS I RESPECT EVEN SUGGEST TAPING A SLIVER OF GARLIC ONTO BAD
PATCHES OF ATHLETE'S FOOT. THIS MIGHT WORK BETTER THAN MANY OF THE COMMERCIAL
TREATMENTS, BUT I SEE A PROBLEM HERE, AS WALKING AROUND WITH GARLIC BETWEEN
YOUR TOES COULD RAISE SOME EYEBROWS—AND ALERT SOME NOSTRILS. YOU COULD ALWAYS TRY THIS APPROACH JUST FOR THE DURATION OF THE AFTERNOON BALL GAME ON TV,
PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING ANY COMPANY.
ONE NOTE OF CAUTION: IF YOU TRY THIS WHOLE-GARLIC APPROACH AND IT SEEMS TO
IRRITATE YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE AND SWITCH BACK TO USING EITHER A GARLIC FOOTBATH OR GARLIC OIL.
V \ V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, GINGER
RANKS SECOND AMONG ALL HERBS IN THE NUMBER OF ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS WITH A
TOTAL OF 23. ONE COMPOUND—CAPRYLIC ACID—IS SO POTENT THAT A CHEMIST I KNOW
68
ATHLETE'S FOO T
SUGGESTS TAKING THREE CAPSULES A DAY FOR ALL MANNER OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS. OF
COURSE, UNLESS YOU'RE A CHEMIST, YOU PROBABLY CAN'T GET PURE CAPRYLIC ACID,
WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND USING GINGER INSTEAD. I'M STILL SKEPTICAL OF ISOLATED
PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS) TAKEN OUT OF THEIR EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT.
YOU CAN PREPARE A STRONG DECOCTION BY ADDING AN OUNCE OF CHOPPED GINGER
ROOT TO A CUP OF BOILING WATER. SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES AND APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO
THE PROBLEM AREAS TWICE A DAY WITH A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
VVV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). GARLIC MAY BE MY NUMERO UNO TREATMENT FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT, BUT IRONICALLY, IN MY DATABASE, IT IS NOWHERE NEAR THE
TOP OF THE LIST OF HERBS CONTAINING THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ANTIFUNGAL COMPOUNDS.
THAT DISTINCTION BELONGS TO LICORICE, WHICH HAS 25 REPORTEDLY FUNGICIDAL COMPOUNDS. (GARLIC HAS ONLY 10, BUT THEY ARE QUITE POTENT.)
LICORICE'S CLEAR ANTIFUNGAL ACTION LENDS CREDENCE TO THE CHINESE PRACTICE OF
USING IT TO TREAT RINGWORM. I'D ADD SOME CHOPPED LICORICE STICKS TO THE GARLIC
FOOTBATH MENTIONED ABOVE.
YOU COULD ALSO SIMPLY BREW A STRONG DECOCTION USING ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN
TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF WATER. BRING IT TO A BOIL, SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES, THEN LET IT COOL. APPLY THE DECOCTION DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREAS USING A
COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
V%^. TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). TEATREE OIL IS A POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC THAT'S VERY USEFUL AGAINST ATHLETE'S FOOT. DILUTE THE OIL WITH AN EQUAL
AMOUNT OF WATER OR VEGETABLE OIL AND APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA THREE
TIMES A DAY USING A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH. JUST DON'T INGEST IT. LIKE SO MANY
OTHER ESSENTIAL PLANT OILS, SMALL AMOUNTS OF TEATREE OIL, ON THE ORDER OF A FEW
TEASPOONS, CAN BE FATAL.
V* CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE OIL IS ALSO FUNGICIDAL. IN
EUROPE IT'S INCORPORATED INTO MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTISEPTICS. I WOULD SUGGEST USING CAMOMILE OIL IN THE SAME WAY AS TEATREE OIL. OR YOU CAN MIX THE TWO.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION. IF
IT SEEMS TO HELP, GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE
ITCHING OR IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE IMMUNE-STIMULATING
ACTION OF THIS HERB IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR TREATING YEAST INFECTIONS, BUT
I'D ALSO RECOMMEND IT FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT. TO BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM, YOU
COULD BUY A TINCTURE AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND ADD THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT
TO JUICE THREE TIMES A DAY TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE OTHER HERBAL APPROACHES TO ATHLETE'S FOOT. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE
OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
69
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VX GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). THIS HERB CONTAINS BERBERINE,
A POWERFUL ANTIFUNGAL AND ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUND, WHICH MAKES IT AN EXCELLENT ANTIBIOTIC. BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY SOURCE OF BERBERINE. BARBERRY, GOLDTHREAD,
OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT ALL CONTAIN IT, AND ALL HAVE BEEN USED TRADITIONALLY
TO TREAT YEAST AND OTHER FUNGAL INFECTIONS.
YOU MIGHT BUY A GOLDENSEAL TINCTURE AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
USUALLY, THE GUIDELINES SUGGEST ADDING IT TO JUICE THREE TIMES A DAY. IF YOU WANT
TO USE IT EXTERNALLY, YOU CAN MAKE A STRONG DECOCTION WITH THE DRIED HERB. ADD
FIVE TO SEVEN TEASPOONS TO A CUP OF WATER, BRING IT TO A BOIL AND LET IT SIMMER FOR
20 MINUTES. AFTER THE LIQUID COOLS TO A TOLERABLE TEMPERATURE, USE A COTTON BALL
OR CLEAN CLOTH TO APPLY IT TO THE AFFECTED AREA. YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO REPEAT
THE APPLICATION UP TO THREE TIMES A DAY.
VV LEMONGRASS (CYMBOPOGON, VARIOUS SPECIES). SCIENTISTS HAVE
DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT FUNGICIDAL ACTIVITY FOR LEMONGRASS OIL AGAINST SEVERAL
COMMON INFECTION-CAUSING FUNGI.
ENJOY DRINKING LEMONGRASS TEA ONE TO FOUR TIMES A DAY. AND FOR ADDITIONAL
ANTIFUNGAL BENEFIT, USE THE SPENT TEA BAGS AS COMPRESSES DIRECTLY ON THE AFFECTED AREA.
V ARROWROOT (MARANTA ARUNDINACEA) AND OTHER HERB POWDERS.
SINCE MOISTURE AND DARKNESS HELP THE GROWTH OF FOOT FUNGUS, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY
TO PREVENT IT IF YOU PUT SOME DRYING POWDER INSIDE YOUR SOCKS AND EVEN YOUR
SHOES. YOU CAN GET A NUMBER OF POWDERS MADE FROM THE DRIED LEAVES, STEMS OR
ROOTS OF HERBS, INCLUDING ARROWROOT, COMFREY AND GOLDENSEAL.
V CINNAMON {CINNARNOMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER FUNGICIDAL HERB TEAS. WHILE YOU'RE APPLYING HERBAL OILS AND TEAS EXTERNALLY, THERE
ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF BEVERAGE TEAS MADE WITH HERBS THAT HAVE FUNGICIDAL PROPERTIES THAT COULD PROVE HELPFUL. I WENT INTO MY DATABASE AND ASKED IT TO PRINT A
LIST OF ALL THE PLANTS CONTAINING MORE THAN TEN FUNGICIDAL CHEMICALS. IT DIDN'T
TAKE THE COMPUTER LONG TO COME UP WITH 38 SPECIES, INCLUDING CINNAMON,
FENNEL, PEPPERMINT, DILL, TARRAGON, BASIL, TEA, ORANGE, BLACK CURRANT, SAGE,
THYME, RED CLOVER, LEMON AND SPEARMINT. JUST BREW THEM UP IN ANY COMBINATION THAT APPEALS TO YOU FOR A LITTLE ANTIFUNGAL BOOST TO WHATEVER OTHER TREATMENT
YOU HAPPEN TO BE USING.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). PAKISTANI STUDIES SHOW THAT OIL OF
TURMERIC INHIBITS MANY COMMON PROBLEM FUNGI, EVEN AT VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS. I'D GO WITH COMMERCIAL OIL OF TURMERIC, DILUTING IT WITH WATER (ONE PART
OIL TO TWO PARTS WATER) AND APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA USING A COTTON
BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
V TOMATO-AND-HERB SAUCE. HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
SOME OTHER HERBS THAT HAVE FUNGICIDAL PROPERTIES. MAKE A TOMATO SAUCE AND GO
70
BACKACHE
VERY HEAVY ON THE BASIL, CELERY, CARROT, DILL, FENNEL, SAGE AND THYME. IN ONE
QUICK MEAL, YOU'LL GET A DISH WITH DOZENS OF FUNGICIDES: JUST HEAT IT UP AND POUR
OVER PASTA. (I ALMOST HESITATE TO SAY THIS, BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PUT UP WITH THE
MESS, YOU COULD ALSO SPREAD A BIT OF THIS SAUCE BETWEEN YOUR TOES FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS. IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT TOMATO FESTIVAL IN SPAIN, WHERE EVERYBODY GETS
SPLATTERED WITH TOMATOES.)
BACKACHE
B
OTH MY WIFE AND I SHARE A PROPENSITY FOR BACK PROBLEMS. PEGGY IS A
GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW BACK PROBLEMS OFTEN RUN IN FAMILIES. SHE AND HER
TWO SISTERS (LIKE THEIR LATE MOTHER) ALL HAVE A PECULIAR KINK IN THE SAME AREA OF
THEIR BACKS THAT CAUSES THEM GRIEF, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING EXTENDED KITCHEN WORK
AT SINK HEIGHT.
AS FOR ME, SCROOGE THAT I AM, I BLAME MY MOST SERIOUS BACK PROBLEM ON
CHRISTMAS. IT WAS DECEMBER 23, 1991, WHEN PEGGY AND I WENT TO A NEARBY
CHRISTMAS TREE FARM TO SELECT A LIVING TREE. WANTING TO REPLANT THE TREE, I DUG A
BIG BALL OF EARTH WITH IT AND MANAGED TO HEAVE IT INTO THE WHEELBARROW THE
OWNER HAD LENT ME. I SUCCESSFULLY WHEELED THAT 100-POUND LOAD 100 YARDS UP
THE HILL TO MY STATION WAGON, BUT WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO LIFT IT FROM THE WHEELBARROW TO THE WAGON'S TRUNK, SOMETHING SNAPPED.
AGONY ENSUED. IT GREW WORSE AS WE DROVE HOME. SANTA'S BACK WAS RUINED. I
COULD NOT LIE, SIT OR STAND COMFORTABLY. I SLEPT TERRIBLY, SIDEWAYS ON A COUCH WITH
THREE PILLOWS UNDER MY LEFT SIDE. THE ONLY HELP WE COULD FIND THE
FOLLOWING DAY, CHRISTMAS EVE, WAS A CHIROPRACTOR. HE TOOK A $95 X-RAY, DECLINED TO
DO MAJOR MANIPULATIONS AND SAID THAT I SHOULD SEE AN ORTHOPEDIST.
A WEEK LATER, THE ORTHOPEDIST SAID I SHOULD CONSULT A NEUROSURGEON. NOT SURPRISINGLY, HE SAID I NEEDED SURGERY. HE INSISTED THIS WAS MY ONLY OPTION, GIVEN
MY X-RAYS. SO ULTIMATELY (TWO MONTHS LATER), I HAD SURGERY FOLLOWED BY PHYSICAL
THERAPY. I ALSO USED HEALING HERBS AND HAD ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENTS. I THINK THE
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS GAVE ME MORE RELIEF THAN THE PHYSICIANS.
BACKACHES AHOUNA
IT SEEMS THAT EVERYWHERE I LOOK, PEOPLE HAVE BACK PROBLEMS. THAT'S NOT SURPRISING, BECAUSE ACHING BACKS ARE ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST PREVALENT HEALTH PROBLEMS. ESTIMATES VARY, BUT THE EXPERTS GENERALLY AGREE THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
TWO AND FIVE MILLION AMERICANS SUFFER SERIOUS BACK PAIN EACH YEAR.
I 71
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
AT SOME POINT IN LIFE, ABOUT
FOUR OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS EXPERIENCE BACK PAIN SEVERE ENOUGH TO
REQUIRE MEDICAL INTERVENTION—
ANYTHING FROM TAKING ASPIRIN TO
MAJOR SURGERY. AND AT ANY GIVEN
MOMENT, SOMETHING LIKE ONEQUARTER OF THE COUNTRY IS DEALING
WITH PREVIOUS BACK TROUBLE BY
TAKING MEDICATION, DOING EXERCISES
OR MAKING OTHER LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS TO CONVALESCE AND KEEP
FROM REINJURING THEIR BACKS.
BAD BACKS ALSO COST THE
COUNTRY A FORTUNE—$16 BILLION A
YEAR IN MEDICAL TREATMENT AND $80
BILLION IN LOST WAGES AND PRODUCTIVITY.
BE WARY
OR SURGERY
DOCTORS USED TO TREAT BACK
PAIN WITH REST, LONG-TERM MEDICATION AND SURGERY. NOW THEY WILL
GENERALLY RECOMMEND SHORT-TERM
MEDICATION, EXERCISE AND, INCREASINGLY, CHIROPRACTIC, YOGA OR SOME
OTHER FORMERLY SCORNED ALTERNATIVE
THERAPY.
I'M GLAD SURGERY HAS FALLEN OUT
OF FAVOR. MY OWN BACK SURGERY WAS
USELESS. I DID NOT SEEK A SECOND OPINION, EVEN THOUGH FRIENDS ADVISED ME TO.
WHY? BECAUSE I'M A LAZY CHEAPSKATE WHO GOES WITH THE FLOW OF AN HMO, AND I
WANTED SO DESPERATELY TO PUT MY BACK PAIN BEHIND ME.
I'LL GO TO MY GRAVE NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE SURGERY DID ME ANY GOOD. I
HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT CERVICAL FUSION—THE OPERATION I ENDURED—IS ANOTHER
OF THOSE OVERPERFORMED OPERATIONS. I FOUND OUT THAT BAD X-RAYS DON'T ALWAYS
MEAN BAD BACKS AND THAT GOOD X-RAYS DON'T ALWAYS MEAN GOOD BACKS. I LEARNED
MOVING TOWARD A CURE
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR AN
ACHING BACK IS TO STOP EXERCISING, ACCORDING TO LEON ROOT, M.D., ORTHOPEDIC
SURGEON AND AUTHOR OF OH, MY ACHING
BACK. IN FACT, EXERCISE EXPERTS CLAIM THAT
80 TO 90 PERCENT OF BACK PROBLEMS ARE
CAUSED BY WEAK MUSCLES. DOCTORS HAVE
ALSO COME AROUND TO THIS VIEW AND NOW
RECOMMEND EXERCISE INSTEAD OF REST.
I CAN ATTEST TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
THIS APPROACH. I DO BACK EXERCISES RELIGIOUSLY EVERY MORNING BEFORE MY SHOWER
AND ALSO BEFORE AND AFTER ACTIVITIES THAT I
KNOW CAN TRIGGER BACK PAIN—CUTTING MY
LAWN (MORE THAN AN ACRE), STANDING IN
LONG LINES OR AT COCKTAIL PARTIES, AND
MOVING HEAVY OBJECTS. I SWIM WHEN THE
OPPORTUNITY ARISES, RIDE A STATIONARY BIKE
AND WALK A MILE OR TWO A DAY.
THE YMCA HAS DEVELOPED A POPULAR
NATIONWIDE BACK EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT
COMBINES STRENGTH TRAINING, FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES AND RELAXATION. ABOUT 80 PERCENT
OF ENROLLEES REPORT IMPROVEMENT, AND 31
PERCENT BECOME PAIN-FREE. YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CONTACT YOUR LOCAL Y AND ASK
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. THINK ABOUT IT: ABOUT
ONE-THIRD OF BAD BACKS CAN BE CURED WITH
NO MEDICINE AT ALL.
72
BACKACHE
THAT 80 PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN THE KIND OF DISTRESS I HAD RECOVER IN FOUR MONTHS
WITHOUT SURGERY.
BUT UNRELENTING PAIN MAKES PEOPLE DESPERATE. WE AMERICANS UNDERGO A
LOT LESS BACK SURGERY THAN WE USED TO, BUT THERE ARE STILL ABOUT 20 TIMES MORE
BACK OPERATIONS PER CAPITA IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN CANADA AND EUROPE.
SO HERE'S MY ADVICE: IF A DOCTOR SAYS YOU NEED BACK SURGERY, GET SEVERAL OTHER
OPINIONS BEFORE GOING UNDER THE KNIFE. I SHOULD HAVE, BUT NOW THAT'S WATER OVER
THE DAM.
IN THE MEANTIME, WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT THE PAIN? IMMEDIATELY AFTER A
BACK INJURY OR A FLARE-UP OF BACK PAIN, DOCTORS RECOMMEND PAIN-RELIEVING AND
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATIONS SUCH AS ASPIRIN AND OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS. FOR REALLY BAD PAIN, STRONGER MEDICATIONS MIGHT BE NECESSARY, INCLUDING CODEINE OR OTHER NARCOTICS. IF YOU'RE IN SERIOUS PAIN, I'D SUGGEST
TAKING WHATEVER THE DOCTOR ORDERS. RECENTLY, PHYSICIANS ARE MORE INCLINED TO
GIVE SLOW-RELEASE MORPHINE, WHICH ACTUALLY COMES FROM AN HERBAL SOURCE—THE
OPIUM POPPY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BACKACHE
FOR LESSER PAIN OR LINGERING PAIN, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBAL ALTERNATIVES
THAT CAN PROVE HELPFUL.
"W%> RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). RED PEPPER CONTAINS A
MARVELOUS PAIN-RELIEVING CHEMICAL—CAPSAICIN—THAT IS SO POTENT THAT A TINY
AMOUNT PROVIDES THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN SOME POWERFUL PHARMACEUTICAL TOPICAL ANALGESICS. ONE PRODUCT, ZOSTRIX, CONTAINS ONLY 0.025 PERCENT CAPSAICIN.
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW (OR CARE) WHETHER RED PEPPER'S EFFECTIVENESS IS
DUE TO CAPSAICIN'S ABILITY TO INTERFERE WITH PAIN PERCEPTION, TO ITS ABILITY TO
TRIGGER RELEASE OF THE BODY'S OWN PAIN-RELIEVING ENDORPHINS, TO ITS SALICYLATES, OR
TO ALL THREE. ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT WORKS.
YOU CAN BUY A COMMERCIAL CREAM CONTAINING CAPSAICIN AND USE THAT. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER, PEOPLE SIMPLY USE RED PEPPER. YOU CAN, TOO, AT
CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS. A HOT PEPPER COSTS A FEW CENTS, WHILE CAPSAICIN DRUGS
COST A FEW DOLLARS.
YOU CAN MASH A RED PEPPER AND RUB IT DIRECTLY ON THE PAINFUL AREA. YOU CAN
ALSO TAKE ANY WHITE SKIN CREAM THAT YOU HAVE ON HAND—COLD CREAM WILL DO—
AND MIX IN ENOUGH RED PEPPER TO TURN IT PINK.
WHETHER YOU USE A CREAM OR A HOT PEPPER, BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD: YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT IN YOUR EYES. ALSO, SINCE SOME PEOPLE
ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS COMPOUND, YOU SHOULD TEST IT ON A SMALL AREA OF SKIN
73
CHOOSIN G TH E HERBS THA T HEA L
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO USE BEFORE USING IT ON A LARGER AREA. IF IT
SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.
V W WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHE R FORMS OF NATURA L
ASPIRIN. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH TAKING ASPIRIN, SINCE IT WAS ORIGINALLY DERIVED
FROM AN HERBAL SOURCE. IT ORIGINALLY CAME FROM COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SALICYLATES THAT OCCUR NATURALLY IN WILLOW BARK, MEADOWSWEET AND WINTERGREEN. ANY
OF THESE HERBS CAN BE MADE INTO PAIN-RELIEVING TEAS.
MANY SALICYLATE-RICH PLANTS ALSO CONTAIN METHYL-SALICYLATE, AN ASPIRIN-LIKE
COMPOUND WITH A PARTICULARLY PLEASING
SMELL. ONE IS WINTERGREEN. ANOTHER IS
BIRCH BARK, ONCE USED BY AMERICAN INDIANS TO MAKE A TEA THAT THEY DRANK OR APPLIED EXTERNALLY TO TREAT LOWER BACK PAIN.
ON OCCASION I HAVE MADE SUCH TEAS BY
THROWING ROUGHLY A HANDFUL OF BIRCH BARK
OR WINTERGREEN INTO A CUP OR TWO OF BOILING
WATER AND LETTING IT STEEP FOR ABOUT TEN
MINUTES. (REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T USE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.)
OIL OF WINTERGREEN, WHICH IS HIGH IN
METHYL-SALICYLATE, ALSO SERVES AS A GOOD PAIN RELIEVER FOR EXTERNAL USE. IT MAY
BE APPLIED DURING MASSAGE. (PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KEEP OIL OF WINTERGREEN OUT
OF CHILDREN'S REACH. IT HAS A TEMPTING AROMA, BUT INGESTING EVEN A LITTLE CAN
PROVE FATAL.)
W . PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA) AND OTHER MINIS. YOU WILL FIND THE
COMPOUNDS MENTHOL AND CAMPHOR IN MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER BACKACHE MEDICATIONS. THEY ARE CHEMICALS THAT CAN HELP EASE THE MUSCLE TIGHTNESS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO MANY BAD BACKS. MENTHOL IS A NATURAL CONSTITUENT OF PLANTS IN THE MINT
FAMILY, PARTICULARLY PEPPERMINT AND SPEARMINT, ALTHOUGH THE AROMATIC OILS OF ALL
THE OTHER MINTS CONTAIN IT AS WELL. CAMPHOR OCCURS IN SPIKE LAVENDER, HYSSOP AND
CORIANDER.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. TREATMENT WITH ESSENTIAL OILS CAN OFTEN HELP
RELIEVE THE PAINFUL MUSCLE SPASMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO BACK PAIN. SEVERAL OF
THESE—SAGE, ROSEMARY, THYME, HORSEBALM AND MOUNTAIN DITTANY—ARE RICH IN
THYMOL AND CARVACROL, COMPOUNDS THAT HELP MUSCLES RELAX.
WHITE WILLOW \<
THE SALICIN IN WILLOW IS "HERBAL
ASPIRIN** AND HAS BEEN USED TO
RELIEVE PAIN SINCE 500 B.C.
74
BAD BREATH
TO USE ANY OF THESE OILS, ADD A FEW DROPS TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF ANY
VEGETABLE OIL AND MASSAGE THE OIL MIXTURE DIRECTLY INTO THE AFFECTED AREA. YOU
MIGHT ALSO ADD A FEW DROPS OF THE OIL TO A HOT BATH AND SOAK FOR A WHILE, INHALING
THE STEAMY VAPORS. (REMEMBER, THOUGH, NEVER TO INGEST AN ESSENTIAL OIL, AS SMALL
QUANTITIES OF SOME OILS, ON THE ORDER OF A SINGLE TEASPOON, CAN BE FATAL.)
OTHER COMPOUNDS WITH POTENT MUSCLE-RELAXING ACTION THAT CAN RELIEVE BACK
SPASMS ARE BORNEOL AND BORNYL-ACETATE. PLANTS RICH IN THESE CHEMICALS INCLUDE
CARDAMOM, SAGE AND ROSEMARY. MY DATABASE TELLS ME THAT BORNEOL IS AN EFFECTIVE
ANTISPASMODIC COMPOUND AT A VERY DILUTE CONCENTRATION, MAKING IT EVEN MORE
POTENT THAN MENTHOL, CAMPHOR, THYMOL AND CARVACROL.
THERE ARE ALSO A FEW OTHER OILS THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. AROMATHERAPISTS
OFTEN SUGGEST USING THE OILS OF BIRCH, LAVENDER, BLACK PEPPER, CLARY, GINGER AND
MARJORAM TO ALLEVIATE BACKACHE. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE ANY OF THESE, AS ALL
HAVE A FOLKLORIC HISTORY FOR RELIEVING CRAMPS OR BACKACHES, AND ALL CONTAIN PAINRELIEVING AND MUSCLE-RELAXING COMPOUNDS.
WHY USE THE PLANT OIL IF YOU CAN OBTAIN CHEMICALLY ISOLATED MENTHOL OR
SOME OTHER MUSCLE-RELAXING CHEMICAL? BECAUSE, IN MY OPINION, THE WHOLE AROMATIC HERB OIL IS LIKELY TO WORK BETTER. THESE OILS EVOLVED TO PROTECT THE PLANTS
FROM PESTS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES. THE FACT THAT AROMATIC HERB OILS
EVOLVED INTO A CHEMICALLY COMPLEX MIXTURE SUGGESTS THAT ALL THE CHEMICALS IN
THEM WORK TOGETHER.

H
ERBALIST TOM WOLFE, OWNER OF THE SMILE HERB SHOP IN COLLEGE PARK,
MARYLAND, AND A FRIEND OF MINE FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES, IS A STUDENT OF PERSIAN LITERATURE AND AN ADMIRER OF PERSIAN CULTURE. HE ONCE TOLD ME
ABOUT A HIGH-CLASS PERSIAN DINNER HE ATTENDED IN THE WASHINGTON, D.C., AREA, IN
PART FOR THE FOOD AND IN PART TO BRUSH UP HIS FARSI LANGUAGE SKILLS.
ON A LARGE ROUND BOARD IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE STOOD FOUR LARGE BOWLS FILLED
WITH FRESH CORIANDER, PARSLEY, SPEARMINT AND TARRAGON; THE GUESTS ROLLED THE HERBS
IN PITA BREAD AND MUNCHED THEM BETWEEN COURSES TO CLEANSE THE PALATE. NOT COINCIDENTALLY, ALL OF THESE HERBS ALSO HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USE AS BREATH FRESHENERS.
IN FACT, THE ANCIENT CUSTOM OF ENDING A MEAL WITH A SPRIG OF STOMACH-SOOTHING,
BREATH-FRESHENING MINT EVOLVED INTO OUR USE OF AFTER-DINNER MINTS.
BY THE TIME THE MEAL WAS OVER, WOLFE TOLD ME, NEARLY A POUND OF FRESH
HERBS HAD BEEN CONSUMED IN THESE PERSIAN PHYTOCHEMICAL PITA SANDWICHES.
75
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FIRST HERBAL TIP IN THIS CHAPTER—FOR A QUICK BREATH
CLEANUP AT A RESTAURANT, SAVE THE DECORATIVE PARSLEY SPRIG AND EAT IT LAST.
BAA BREATH BASICS
I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT BAD BREATH IS BETTER THAN NO BREATH AT ALL. BUT WHEN IT
COMES TO HALITOSIS, FM A HYPOCHONDRIAC. FM BY NO MEANS ALONE. CONVENE A
CONVENTION OF EVERYONE WHO'S CERTAIN THEIR BREATH IS ALWAYS SWEET-SMELLING,
AND YOU'D HAVE AN EMPTY AUDITORIUM. IT'S NO WONDER THAT AMERICANS SPEND
MORE THAN $200 MILLION A YEAR ON BREATH-FRESHENING PRODUCTS.
MOST BAD BREATH IS CAUSED BY BACTERIA IN THE MOUTH. BACTERIA PRODUCE
WASTES THAT SMELL, WELL, BAD. DURING THE DAY, OXYGEN-RICH SALIVA ACTS AS A NATURAL MOUTHWASH, KEEPING ORAL BACTERIA LARGELY AT BAY. BUT AT NIGHT, SALIVATION
SLOWS, AND THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE MOUTH SHIFTS FROM MILDLY ACIDIC TO
MILDLY ALKALINE, WHICH ENCOURAGES THE GROWTH OF ODOR-CAUSING BACTERIA. BY
MORNING, YOU HAVE WHAT THOSE COMMERCIALS CALL "MORNING MOUTH." AN HERBAL
MOUTHWASH CAN HELP AS MUCH AS, OR MORE THAN, ANY OF THE STORE-BOUGHT PRODUCTS. THE RECIPE APPEARS ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE.
IN AT LEAST ONE-THIRD OF PEOPLE WITH HALITOSIS, THE CAUSE IS GUM (PERIODONTAL) DISEASE. BACTERIA WORM THEIR WAY DOWN INTO THE GUMS BELOW THE TOOTH
LINE, WHERE NOT EVEN THE FANCIEST TOOTHBRUSH CAN REACH. AS THEY GROW, THEY DESTROY GUM TISSUE. IF NOT TREATED, THIS GUM DAMAGE EVENTUALLY CAUSES TOOTH LOSS.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE BACTERIA RELEASE THE WASTES THAT CAUSE BAD BREATH.
FLOSSING CAN HELP CONTROL GUM DISEASE. SO CAN A MOUTHWASH CONTAINING
THE RIGHT HERBS. BUT CHRONIC HALITOSIS MAY ALSO BE A SIGN OF SEVERAL OTHER CONDITIONS, ACCORDING TO ISRAEL KLEINBERG, M.D., CHAIRMAN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
ORAL BIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT STONY BROOK.
SOME ARE QUITE SERIOUS: CIRRHOSIS OF THE LIVER, DIABETES, KIDNEY FAILURE AND
CANCER IN THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT, AMONG OTHERS. IF YOUR BAD BREATH JUST
WON'T QUIT, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BAA BREATH
MOST BAD BREATH IS JUST A PASSING INCONVENIENCE, AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
HERBS THAT CAN HELP ERASE IT.
V * ^ CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM). IN MY DATABASE, CARDAMOM
IS THE RICHEST SOURCE OF THE COMPOUND CINEOLE, A POTENT ANTISEPTIC THAT ALSO KILLS
BAD BREATH BACTERIA. AND IT MAY HAVE MORE THAN JUST A BREATH-FRESHENING BENEFIT IF YOU USE IT DURING A ROMANTIC DATE. ARAB CULTURES CONSIDER IT AN APHRODISIAC. IF YOU'RE NOT PARTIAL TO MY HALITOSISADE, TRY CHEWING CARDAMOM FRUITS
(SEEDS). I CHEW THEM FOR A WHILE AND THEN SPIT THEM OUT. I ALSO ADD THEM TO
HERBAL TEAS AND LIQUEURS.
76
B A D BREATH
VVV EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS
GLOBULUS). MANY COMMERCIAL
MOUTHWASHES CONTAIN ALCOHOL,
WHICH HELPS KILL ODOR-CAUSING BACTERIA, AND EUCALYPTOL, A COMPOUND
THAT IS DERIVED FROM EUCALYPTUS OIL
AND IS RICH IN CINEOLE.
INSTEAD OF BUYING EXPENSIVE
MOUTHWASHES, YOU CAN SIMPLY MIX
UP SOME OF MY OWN UNIQUE HALITOSISADE USING CRUSHED EUCALYPTUS
LEAVES. NO ACCESS TO EUCALYPTUS?
NO PROBLEM.
MANY OTHER HERBS ARE ALSO RICH
IN CINEOLE. WHILE NONE OF THEM EXCEPT CARDAMOM COME CLOSE TO EUCALYPTUS'S CINEOLE CONTENT, ANY OF
THESE HERBS WOULD HELP FRESHEN THE
BREATH: SPEARMINT, ROSEMARY, SWEET
ANNIE, GINGER, NUTMEG, LAVENDER,
BEE BALM, PEPPERMINT, TANSY, YARROW, CINNAMON, BASIL, TURMERIC,
LEMON LEAF, HYSSOP, TARRAGON,
LEMON VERBENA OR FENNEL.
VV%, PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM
CRISPUM) AND OTHER PLANTS RICH IN CHLOROPHYLL. MY COUSIN SUZIE, WHO HAS
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, CALLED RECENTLY TO ASK WHAT I MIGHT RECOMMEND. I ADVISED
HER TO TAKE GARLIC TO LOWER HER BLOOD PRESSURE, PLUS PARSLEY TO MINIMIZE THE HALITOSIS CAUSED BY THE GARLIC. BRIGHT GREEN PARSLEY IS A RICH SOURCE OF THE GREEN
PLANT PIGMENT, CHLOROPHYLL, WHICH IS A POWERFUL BREATH FRESHENER. MUNCH SOME
PARSLEY AFTER MEALS, AFTER DRINKING COFFEE OR AFTER EATING OR DRINKING ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT CAUSE MALODOROUS BREATH.
IN FACT, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO REFRIGERATE FRESH SPRIGS OF PARSLEY AND OTHER
PLANTS RICH IN CHLOROPHYLL, NOTABLY BASIL AND CILANTRO, AND NIBBLE AS NEEDED.
W ANISE (PIMPINELLA ANISUM). THE SEEDS OF THIS LICORICE-FLAVORED HERB
HAVE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO FRESHEN THE BREATH. I'M NOT SURPRISED,
BECAUSE IT WORKS. BOIL A FEW TEASPOONS OF SEEDS IN A CUP OF WATER FOR A FEW MINUTES. STRAIN, THEN DRINK OR USE AS A MOUTHWASH.
W CORIANDER (CORIANDRUM SATIVUM). CORIANDER IS A CANTONESE FOLK
REMEDY FOR BAD BREATH. TO USE THIS HERB, ADD A FEW OUNCES OF FRESH CORIANDER
HALITOSISODE
TO MAKE HALITOSISADE, MY BREATH-FRESHENING HERBAL ALTERNATIVE TO COMMERCIAL
MOUTHWASHES, STEEP ANY COMBINATION OF
THE HERBS IN THIS CHAPTER IN VODKA. YOU
CAN PUT UP TO SEVERAL OUNCES OF HERBS PER
PINT OF VODKA IN A WIDE-MOUTHED JAR WITH
A SCREW-ON LID.
PERSONALLY, I FAVOR EUCALYPTUS, ROSEMARY AND SPEARMINT, PLUS WHATEVER ELSE I
HAVE ON HAND. I DON'T USUALLY USE CARDAMOM BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. IT DOES
HAVE A NICE FLAVOR, HOWEVER.
FOR PERSONAL USE, I JUST LEAVE THE
HERBS IN THE VODKA AND LET IT STEEP INDEFINITELY. WHEN MAKING MOUTHWASH FOR
SOMEONE ELSE, I MIGHT BE ELEGANT ENOUGH
TO STRAIN OUT THE HERBS AFTER SEVERAL DAYS
SO IT LOOKS NICE AND CLEAR. THE CHOICE IS
YOURS, BUT I KIND OF LIKE THE LOOK OF ALL
THOSE HERBS FLOATING IN MY BOTTLE OF
MOUTHWASH.
77
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
(ALSO KNOWN AS CILANLRO), TO TWO CUPS OF WATER AND BOIL FOR A FEW MINUTES.
STRAIN, THEN DRINK OR USE AS A MOUTHWASH.
VV DILL (ANETHUM GRAVEOLENS). LIKE PARSLEY, DILL IS RICH IN CHLOROPHYLL.
TRY DILL TEA AFTER MEALS; USE ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF LEAVES OR MASHED SEEDS PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER. OR SIMPLY CHEW ON A FEW DILL SEEDS TO FRESHEN YOUR BREATH.
(IF YOU ARE PREGNANT, USING DILL IN MEDICINAL AMOUNTS COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS.
YOU SHOULD RESERVE IT FOR OCCASIONAL, MODERATE USE.)
VV PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). PEPPERMINT TEA IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HALITOSIS, WITH GOOD REASON. AROMATIC PEPPERMINT OIL
IS A POTENT ANTISEPTIC, BUT IT IS TOXIC AND SHOULD NEVER
BE INGESTED.
VV SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). AN
HERBALIST I RESPECT RECOMMENDS GARGLING SEVERAL TIMES A DAY WITH WARM SAGE TEA FOR
MOUTH SORES AND BAD BREATH. SAGE HAS
BREATH-FRESHENING PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO
PARSLEY AND PEPPERMINT, SO I AGREE WITH HIM.
VV WILD BERGAMOT (MONARDA FISTULOSA). IF YOU LIKE THYME, YOU'LL LIKE WILD
BERGAMOT, EITHER BY ITSELF OR MIXED INTO OTHER
HERB TEAS. IT CONTAINS SOME OF THE SAME ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS USED IN COMMERCIAL
BREATH FRESHENERS. USE TWO TEASPOONS PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES.
V CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM). BEFORE THE PEOPLE IN SOME ANCIENT ASIAN CULTURES
WERE PERMITTED TO SEE THEIR KING, THEY HAD TO
CHEW CLOVES TO FRESHEN THEIR BREATH. THIS HERB'S
POWERFULLY AROMATIC OIL IS ANTIBACTERIAL. ADD
SEVERAL TABLESPOONS TO ABOUT A PINT OF VODKA AND STEEP FOR A FEW DAYS TO MAKE A
PLEASANT-TASTING MOUTHWASH. OR BREW A TEA USING A TEASPOON OR TWO OF DRIED HERB.
PEPPERMINT
THIS MINT HAS LONG BEEN
GROWN COMMERCIALLY TO FLAVOR
EVERYTHING FROM CANDIES AND
LIQUEURS TO TOOTHPASTES.
BALI NESS
A
NOTHER PHONE CALL, ANOTHER DESPERATE VOICE, THIS ONE FROM FAR-OFF CALIFORNIA. I'M ALWAYS GETTING CALLS FOR HELP FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING
FOR HERBAL ADVICE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS. EVEN THOUGH I
78
BALDNES S
NEVER DISCOVERED HOW THIS MAN FOUND ME, I STILL REMEMBER HOW UPSET HE WAS
ABOUT LOSING HIS HAIR.
WE TALKED, AND I WOUND UP FAXING HIM INFORMATION ABOUT SAW PALMETTO.
THIS HERB WORKS BY PREVENTING THE CONVERSION OF THE MALE SEX HORMONE TESTOSTERONE INTO DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE (DHT), A SUBSTANCE THAT PLAYS A ROLE IN PROSTATE
ENLARGEMENT. DHT IS ALSO THE HORMONE THAT MAY KILL OFF HAIR FOLLICLES AND CAN
LEAD TO MALE-PATTERN BALDNESS. I SUGGESTED TO MY CALLER THAT SAW PALMETTO MIGHT
HELP SLOW HIS HAIR LOSS.
HAIR LOSS IS GENETICALLY INFLUENCED BUT HARD TO PREDICT. SOMETIMES ALL THE
MEN IN A FAMILY GO BALD, AND SOMETIMES ONLY A FEW DO. BUT MORE THAN HALF OF
AMERICAN MEN SUFFER SIGNIFICANT HAIR LOSS BY AGE 45. MANY WOMEN ALSO SUFFER
HAIR LOSS, BUT IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS MUCH LESS SEVERE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BALDNESS
WHILE I CAN'T PROMISE THAT MY HERBAL APPROACHES WILL COVER YOUR DOME
WITH A THICK MAT OF HAIR, THESE NATURAL ALTERNATIVES MIGHT BE WORTH A TRY.
W * SAW PALMETTO (SERENOA REPENS). THIS REMAINS MY TOP CHOICE, ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A COMBINATION OF APPROACHES THAT INCLUDES AN
ANTI-BALDNESS MEDICATION SUCH AS MINOXIDIL (ROGAINE) OR FINASTERIDE (PROSCAR).
BIOCHEMISTRY SUPPORTS SAW PALMETTO. WE KNOW THAT DHT KILLS OFF THE HAIR FOLLICLES, AND TAKING THIS HERB INTERNALLY BLOCKS THE FORMATION OF DHT. IF IT TURNS
OUT THAT SAW PALMETTO HELPS PREVENT HAIR LOSS, IT WOULD BE THE HERB FOR MEN,
SINCE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT ALSO HELPS PREVENT PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHISA GLABRA). LICORICE CONTAINS ONE COMPOUND
THAT PREVENTS THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERONE TO DHT. YOU COULD PREPARE A BALDNESS-PREVENTION SHAMPOO BY ADDING LICORICE TO YOUR FAVORITE SHAMPOO WHEN
YOU SHOWER.
W ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). FOR CENTURIES, IF NOT MILLENNIA,
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE MASSAGED THEIR SCALPS WITH ROSEMARY IN OLIVE OIL TO
KEEP THEIR HAIR LUSH AND HEALTHY. IS THERE ANYTHING TO REALLY RECOMMEND THIS
PRACTICE, BESIDES WISHFUL THINKING? MASSAGING THE SCALP CERTAINLY STIMULATES
CIRCULATION AND ENCOURAGES HAIR GROWTH, ACCORDING TO WILMA F. BERGFELD, M.D.,
OF THE CLEVELAND CLINIC FOUNDATION IN OHIO. NATUROPATHS OFTEN SUGGEST NIGHTLY
SCALP MASSAGE WITH ONE PART ROSEMARY OIL AND TWO PARTS ALMOND OIL.
V DANSHEN (SALVIA MILTIORRHIZA) AND SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS).
DANSHEN IS ACTUALLY ASIAN RED SAGE. IN FOLKLORE, BOTH DANSHEN AND NATIVE SAGE
HAVE LONG-STANDING REPUTATIONS AS HAIR PRESERVERS.
IN THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE FREQUENTLY USED SAGE EXTRACTS IN HAIR RINSES AND
SHAMPOOS. THE HERB ALLEGEDLY HAD THE ABILITY TO PREVENT HAIR LOSS AND MAINTAIN HAIR COLOR. THIS FOLK USE OF HERBS IS UNLIKELY TO CAUSE ANY HARM, SO I SUG79
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
GEST THAT YOU TRY ADDING A FEW TEASPOONS OF SAGE TINCTURE TO YOUR FAVORITE
SHAMPOO.
V HORSETAIL (EQUISETUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE MINERALS SELENIUM
AND SILICON BOTH HELP PROMOTE CIRCULATION TO THE SCALP, AND AS A RESULT, THEY
HELP MAINTAIN HAIR, ACCORDING TO NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS. BOTH MINERALS
ABOUND IN HORSETAIL. I'D TRY ADDING A TEASPOON OR SO OF DRIED HORSETAIL TO HERBAL
TEAS, BUT YOU SHOULD CHECK WITH A HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER BEFORE USING THIS HERB.
V SAFFLOWER (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS). IN CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE, SAFFLOWER IS CONSIDERED A VASODILATOR, A SUBSTANCE THAT CAUSES BLOOD VESSELS TO
OPEN UP. APPARENTLY, IT ALSO HELPS OPEN THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE SCALP, AND CHINESE PHYSICIANS BELIEVE THAT SAFFLOWER HELPS NUTRIENTS GET TO THE HAIR FOLLICLES.
YOU CAN MASSAGE YOUR SCALP WITH SAFFLOWER OIL OR GRIND UP A FEW TABLESPOONS OF
WHOLE SEEDS AND ADD THE POWDER TO AN HERBAL SHAMPOO.
V SESAME (SESAMUM INDICUM). SESAME SEEDS ARE ALSO A CHINESE
TREATMENT FOR HAIR LOSS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. JUST FOR TASTE, YOU CAN ADD TOASTED SESAME SEEDS TO
ALL KINDS OF DISHES, AND IF THE ADDITIONAL SESAME HELPS YOU KEEP YOUR HAIR, SO
MUCH THE BETTER.
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). TINCTURE OF NETUE LEAF CAN HELP PREVENT BALDING IN THOSE WITH THINNING HAIR, ACCORDING TO RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D.,
THE DEAN OF GERMAN HERBAL PHYSICIANS AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE. I DON'T
KNOW OF ANY STUDIES SUPPORTING THIS, BUT I RESPECT DR. WEISS.
PERHAPS HIS ENDORSEMENT OF NETTLE IS A REMNANT OF THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES,
WHICH WAS THE IDEA THAT A PLANT'S APPEARANCE ANNOUNCES ITS MEDICINAL VALUE.
NETTIE IS A HAIRY PLANT, SO THE DOCTRINE WOULD ENDORSE ITS USE FOR HAIR PROBLEMS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE THERE WILL BE SOME OTHER EVIDENCE TO RECOMMEND THIS HERB FOR BALDING. THE MORE RESEARCHERS LOOK AT NETTLE, THE MORE USES
THEY SEEM TO FIND. TAKING A TEASPOON OR TWO OF TINCTURE A DAY—OR ONE OR TWO
CUPS OF NETTLE TEA—CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T HURT.
BLADDER INIECTIONS
Y
OU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO KNOW RIGHT OFF THE BAT WHETHER CRANBERRY JUICE REALLY HELPS PREVENT BLADDER INFECTIONS. THIS ONE IS EASY:
YES, THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER HERBAL
TREATMENTS THAT CAN HELP AS WELL.
80
BLADDER INFECTION S
BLADDER INFECTION, ALSO CALLED CYSTITIS AND URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), IS A
BACTERIAL INFECTION THAT CAUSES PAINFUL URINATION AND A FEELING THAT THE BLADDER
NEVER COMPLETELY EMPTIES. IT CAN ALSO CAUSE FEVER AND LOW BACK PAIN. URINE FROM
AN INFECTED BLADDER MAY SMELL STRONG AND CONTAIN TINGES OF BLOOD. (IF YOU DEVELOP
ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR DOCTOR FOR TREATMENT.)
SOME 80 PERCENT OF BLADDER INFECTIONS ARE CAUSED BY BACTERIA FROM THE ANAL
AREA, NOTABLY ESCHERICHIA COLI, A MICROORGANISM THAT LIVES IN THE DIGESTIVE TRACT.
MEN CAN DEVELOP BLADDER INFECTIONS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE AN ENLARGED
PROSTATE GLAND, BUT THIS PROBLEM STRIKES MOSTLY WOMEN. WOMEN HAVE A MUCH
SHORTER URETHRA (THE TUBE THROUGH WHICH URINE EXITS THE BODY) THAN MEN, SO THE
E. COLI CAN TRAVEL MORE EASILY INTO WOMEN'S BLADDERS.
BLADDER INFECTIONS OCCUR IN ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF WOMEN, MANY OF WHOM
SUFFER CHRONIC, RECURRING INFECTIONS. MORE THAN 20 PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO DEVELOP BLADDER INFECTIONS HAVE THREE OR MORE A YEAR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BLADDER INFECTIONS
DOCTORS TREAT UTIS WITH ANTIBIOTICS. BUT QUITE OFTEN, NATURAL APPROACHES—
FOODS AND HERBS—WORK JUST AS WELL.
V W BLUEBERRY (VACCINIUM,, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND CRANBERRY
(V. MACROCARPON). I'M ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THESE TWO FRUITS. FOLK PRACTITIONERS HAVE CLAIMED FOR A LONG TIME THAT THEY HELP. A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SHOWED THAT CERTAIN COMPOUNDS
IN CRANBERRY AND BLUEBERRY JUICE PREVENT BACTERIA FROM ADHERING TO THE
BLADDER WALLS. AND IF THEY CAN'T STICK TO THE BLADDER WALLS, THEY WON'T CAUSE
INFECTION THERE.
BOTH CRANBERRY AND BLUEBERRY ALSO CONTAIN ARBUTIN, A CHEMICAL COMPOUND
THAT IS BOTH AN ANTIBIOTIC AND A DIURETIC THAT HELPS RELIEVE EXCESS WATER RETENTION. IN ANOTHER STUDY OF SEVEN JUICES, CRANBERRY AND BLUEBERRY LOWERED E. COLI
ADHESION, WHILE GRAPEFRUIT, GUAVA, MANGO, ORANGE AND PINEAPPLE DID NOT.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE CRANBERRY JUICE PRESCRIPTION IS THAT YOU HAVE TO
DRINK A LOT OF IT. NATUROPATHS SUGGEST DRINKING 17 OUNCES A DAY TO TREAT UTIS.
THE JUICE IS NATURALLY TART AND MUST BE SWEETENED TO BE PALATABLE, MEANING THAT
THIS PRESCRIPTION IS RATHER HIGH IN CALORIES. IF YOU TRY THIS, MAKE SURE YOU ADJUST THE REST OF YOUR DIET ACCORDINGLY.
V \ V YOGURT. WHILE THIS ISN'T AN HERB, I WON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST IT. IT'S TOO
GOOD A NATURAL HEALER TO. EXCLUDE FROM THIS CHAPTER. STUDIES SHOW THAT THE ACTIVE BACTERIAL CULTURES IN YOGURT HELP PREVENT BOTH BLADDER INFECTIONS AND YEAST
INFECTIONS. THE TRICK, OF COURSE, IS TO EAT YOGURT WITH LIVE CULTURES. IF IT HAS LIVE
CULTURES, THE LABEL WILL SAY SO.
81
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HOW ABOUT YOGURT WITH BLUEBERRIES AND CRANBERRY JUICE FOR AN AN INFECTIONFIGHTING BREAKFAST?
W PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CRISPUM) AND OTHE R VEGETABLES. AFTER
CRANBERRY AND BLUEBERRY, JUICES THAT ARE OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR BLADDER INFECTIONS INCLUDE CARROT, CELERY, CUCUMBER AND PARSLEY. PARSLEY IN PARTICULAR HAS A
LONG HISTORY OF USE FOR BLADDER PROBLEMS, AND NO WONDER. GOOD RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT IT'S A DIURETIC THAT HELPS EMPTY THE BLADDER.
V BEARBERRY (ARCTOSTAPHYLOS UVA URSI). FOR MY OTHER HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT AND TREAT BLADDER INFECTION, I'LL TURN TO MY FRIEND VARRO
TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT
PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA.
IN HIS EXCELLENT BOOK HERBS OF CHOICE, DR.
TYLER RELIES ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GERMANY'S COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF NATURAL
MEDICINE EXPERTS THAT ADVISES GERMANY'S
COUNTERPART OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.
DR. TYLER'S LIST LEADS OFF WITH BEARBERRY, A
CLOSE RELATIVE OF CRANBERRY AND BLUEBERRY THAT
CONTAINS A GOOD AMOUNT OF ARBUTIN, A NATURAL DIURETIC AND ANTIBIOTIC.
CALLING BEARBERRY THE "MOST EFFECTIVE ANTIBACTERIAL HERB FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS,"
DR. TYLER QUOTES THE COMMISSION E PRESCRIPTION: TAKE TEN GRAMS A DAY (ABOUT A HALFOUNCE) TO TREAT BLADDER INFECTIONS. THIS MUCH
BEARBERRY CONTAINS ANYWHERE FROM 400 TO 700 MILLIGRAMS OF ARBUTIN. MAXIMUM
ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OCCURS THREE TO FOUR HOURS AFTER TAKING THIS HERB.
V BIRCH (BETULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). COMMISSION E ENDORSES BIRCH
LEAVES AS A DIURETIC OF VALUE IN TREATING BOTH KIDNEY AND URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. CHEMICALS CALLED FLAVONOIDS (MOSTLY HYPEROSIDE AND QUERCETIN) APPARENTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE DIURETIC EFFECT.
IF YOU CAN FIND BIRCH LEAF TINCTURE, COMMISSION E SUGGESTS TAKING TWO TO
THREE GRAMS (ABOUT A TEASPOON) SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. IF YOU HAVE A BIRCH TREE,
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN TINCTURE BY PUTTING TWO TEASPOONS OF BARK IN A CUP OF
VODKA AND LETTING IT STEEP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
I PREFER A TEA MADE FROM CHERRY BIRCH BARK, WHICH YOU CAN MAKE BY ADDING
A HANDFUL OF BARK TO A CUP OR TWO OF BOILING WATER.
V BUCHU (AGATHOSMA BETULINA). BUCHU HAS LONG BEEN A FOLK FAVORITE
AS A DIURETIC AND TREATMENT FOR INFLAMMATION AND INFECTION OF THE KIDNEYS AND
BEARBERRY C
DRIED LEAVES OF
THIS COMMON,
ATTRACTIVE

COVER ARE USED TO
MAKE A DIURETIC TEA

BLADDER INFECTION S
URINARY TRACT. ODDLY, COMMISSION E DID NOT ENDORSE IT. OTHER SOURCES THAT I
TRUST HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE POSITIVE, SAYING THAT BUCHU CAN BE USED AS AN ANTISEPTIC AND DIURETIC IN MILD CASES OF UTI. I'M INCLINED TO CONSIDER BUCHU
HELPFUL. IT CONTAINS DIOSPHENOL, WHICH MAY HAVE AN ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT.
V COUCHGRASS (AGROPYRON REPENS OR ELYMUS REPENS). THE RECOMMENDATION TO USE COUCHGRASS, ALSO KNOWN AS QUACKGRASS, FOR THE TREATMENT OF
URINARY TRACT INFLAMMATION ALSO COMES FROM COMMISSION E. I LIKE THE NAME
QUACKGRASS SO MUCH THAT I FEEL AS IF I HAVE TO ENDORSE IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I
KNOW THAT THIS HERB IS A DIURETIC WITH A LONG FOLK HISTORY OF USE FOR BLADDER AND
KIDNEY STONES. THIS COMMON WEEDY GRASS OCCURS IN ALMOST ALL 50 STATES.
V DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). DANDELION ROOT IS A PARTICULARLY
POTENT DIURETIC. DIURETICS DON'T CURE BLADDER INFECTIONS, BUT THEY HELP FLUSH
URINE OUT OF THE BLADDER, AND SOME BACTERIA ALONG WITH IT. LONG CLINICAL EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS ACTION IS HELPFUL IN TREATING BLADDER INFECTIONS.
WHY IS DANDELION SUCH A POWERFUL DIURETIC? SCIENTISTS AREN'T REALLY SURE.
TWO GROUPS OF CHEMICALS THAT HAVE
BEEN FOUND IN THE PLANT, EUDESMANOLIDES AND GERMACRANOLIDES, APPEAR
TO PLAY A ROLE. THE POTASSIUM IN
DANDELION MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS
DIURETIC EFFECT.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA,
VARIOUS SPECIES) AND GOLDENSEAL
(HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN AS CONEFLOWER, IS
AN IMMUNE SYSTEM BOOSTER. TAKING
ECHINACEA ALONG WITH ANTIBIOTICS CAN
BE A GOOD TREATMENT FOR UTIS. IF
YOU'D LIKE TO USE A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC
AS WELL, TRY GOLDENSEAL.
YOU CAN USE TINCTURES OF ECHINACEA AND GOLDENSEAL ALONE OR IN
COMBINATION. TAKE ONE TO TWO DROPPERFULS (ABOUT A TEASPOON) OF EACH
TWO TO THREE TIMES A DAY. (ALTHOUGH
ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO
TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS
EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)

 THE STANDARD NATURAL GUIDELINES FOR PRE-
' VENTING THIS CONDITION. ALL WOMEN, WHETHER
( THEY'RE PRONE TO BLADDER INFECTIONS OR NOT,
SHOULD:
• DRINK EIGHT GLASSES OF WATER A DAY.

 WOMEN WITH RECURRENT BLADDER INFECTIONS
; SHOULD:
• TAKE SHOWERS INSTEAD OF BATHS.
• DRINK A GLASS OF WATER BEFORE AND AFTER
SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.
• URINATE WITHIN 15 MINUTES AFTER INTERCOURSE.
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ENROD AS ONE OF THE SAFEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE DIURETIC-ANTISEPTIC HERBS. THERE IS
GOOD CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF ITS DIURETIC ACTIVITY. THERE IS ALSO CLEAR SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT IT IS BENEFICIAL IN TREATING KIDNEY INFLAMMATION (NEPHRITIS). ALL OF
THIS SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THIS HERB WOULD ALSO BE OF SOME BENEFIT IN TREATING
BLADDER INFECTIONS.
SEVERAL SPECIES OF GOLDENROD ARE USED WIDELY IN EUROPE TO ALLEVIATE URINARY TRACT INFLAMMATIONS AND TO PREVENT THE FORMATION OF AND FACILITATE THE ELIMINATION OF KIDNEY STONES. COMMISSION E SUGGESTS TAKING GOLDENROD FOR
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF VARIOUS TYPES OF BLADDER AND KIDNEY PROBLEMS.
V LOVAGE {LEVISTICUM OFFICINALE), LOVAGE LOOKS AND SMELLS JUST LIKE
CELERY, AND IT IS ALSO AN EFFECTIVE DIURETIC FOR TREATMENT OF URINARY TRACT INFLAMMATIONS, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E REPORTS.
V MARSH MALLOW {ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). YOU CAN USE A COLD-WATER INFUSION TO SOOTHE THE BURNING OF A BLADDER INFECTION, ACCORDING TO CHRISTOPHER
HOBBS, A DISTINGUISHED FOURTH-GENERATION CALIFORNIA HERBALIST, BOTANIST AND AUTHOR OF ABOUT A DOZEN BOOKS. MAKE THE INFUSION BY SOAKING ABOUT FOUR TEASPOONS OF DRIED MARSH MALLOW IN A QUART OF COLD WATER OVERNIGHT. SIP THE
RESULTING TEA THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS TAKING
STINGING NETTLE FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF KIDNEY STONES. BECAUSE
NETTLE ACTS AS A DIURETIC, THIS TELLS ME THAT IT SHOULD HELP WITH BLADDER INFECTION AS WELL. IN ONE STUDY, TREATMENT OVER 14 DAYS WITH FRESH NETTLE SAP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED URINE VOLUME IN PEOPLE TAKING THE HERB.
BODY ODOR
T
HE CHEMISTRY OF ARMPITS IS RATHER INTERESTING. MUCH OF OUR BODY ODOR
COMES FROM EMANATIONS OF THE APOCRINE SWEAT GLANDS, MOST OF WHICH
ARE LOCATED IN THE UNDERARM AREA. WE'RE ALL BORN WITH THESE SPECIALIZED GLANDS,
BUT THEY DON'T DO MUCH UNTIL PUBERTY, WHEN THEY START SECRETING A MILKY OOZE
THAT HAS NO AROMA. IF WE DON'T WASH IT OFF REGULARLY—EVERY SIX HOURS OR SO—
BACTERIA BEGIN TO COLONIZE THESE APOCRINE SECRETIONS. AND A WHILE LATER WE DEVELOP ... GUESS WHAT?
MEN HAVE MORE AND BIGGER APOCRINE GLANDS THAN WOMEN, SO THEY HAVE
MORE BODY ODOR, ALTHOUGH I BET WOMEN SPEND MORE ON DEODORANTS.
IN ADDITION TO POOR HYGIENE, BODY ODOR MAY BE CAUSED BY A ZINC DEFICIENCY,
DIABETES OR LIVER DISEASE, CHRONIC CONSTIPATION AND CERTAIN PARASITES. VEGETARIANS CLAIM THAT MEAT-EATERS HAVE MORE BODY ODOR.

HIE AMAZING AMAZONIAN ITIRN-ON SHRAB
SOME YEARS AGO, THE TROPICAL SHRUB THE AMAZONIANS CALL PICHO HUAYO CAME UP IN
A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH ALWYN GENTRY, PH.D., THE LATE TROPICAL BOTANIST AND SENIOR CURATOR AT THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN IN ST. LOUIS. HE SAID THAT HUNTERS
IN THE AMAZON RUB THE FRUIT OF THIS SHRUB ALL OVER THEMSELVES IN THE BELIEF THAT IT
PREVENTS THEIR QUARRY FROM SMELLING THEM. IN OTHER WORDS, PICHO HUAYO MASKS THEIR
BODY ODOR. IT'S NOT A TRUE DEODORANT, HOWEVER, BUT JUST AN AROMATIC MASK.
SINCE THAT CHAT, I'VE ASKED SEVERAL AMAZONIAN GUIDES ABOUT PICHO HUAYO.
THEY USE IT NOT ONLY WHEN HUNTING WILD GAME, THEY SAID, BUT ALSO WHEN COURTING
WOMEN. IT MAKES MEN SMELL MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE OPPOSITE SEX, THE GUIDES CLAIM.
ONE NOTED AMAZONIAN TAXONOMIST (A SPECIALIST IN CLASSIFYING PLANTS) SWORE TO
ME THAT HE HAD TRIED IT WITH REMARKABLE SUCCESS, SAYING SLYLY, "I HAVE GOOD EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT IT WORKS." PICHO HUAYO COULD BE A GOLD MINE FOR SOME ENTERPRISING ENTREPRENEUR WITH A FLAIR FOR ROMANCE.
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TRY PICHO HUAYO TO ATTRACT MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX, I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES—AT LEAST NOT YET.
L_—_______—,—.,.......,, J
BATHING IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO CONTROL BODY ODOR, BUT IF YOU DON'T FEEL
SOCIALLY AT EASE WITHOUT A DEODORANT, THERE'S NO NEED TO USE COMMERCIAL ROLLONS OR SPRAYS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BODY ODOR
HERBS HAVE A LONG AND ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORY OF USE AS DEODORANTS. NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE HERBS MOST WIDELY USED ALL HAVE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION AGAINST THE
MICROORGANISMS THAT MAKE OUR APOCRINE SECRETIONS SMELL UNPLEASANT. HERE ARE
SOME TO TRY.
W V CORIANDER (CORIANDRUM SATIVUM), LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA)
AND OTHER HERBS. MY TRUSTY DATABASE SHOWS THAT CORIANDER AND LICORICE BOTH
CONTAIN 20 CHEMICALS WITH ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION. OREGANO AND ROSEMARY HAVE
19; GINGER, 17; NUTMEG, 15; CINNAMON AND CUMIN, 11; AND BAY, 10. (BLACK
PEPPER HAS 14 AND GARLIC 13, BUT I CAN'T SEE RUBBING THEM UNDER MY ARMS.)
LOOKING AT THE QUANTITY OF BACTERICIDAL COMPOUNDS IN VARIOUS HERBS—AS
OPPOSED TO THE NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS—WE FIND THAT LICORICE CONTAINS UP TO 33
PERCENT BACTERICIDAL COMPOUNDS (ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS); THYME, UP TO 21.3 PERCENT; OREGANO, UP TO 8.8 PERCENT; ROSEMARY, UP TO 4.8 PERCENT; CORIANDER, UP TO
2.2 PERCENT; AND FENNEL, UP TO 1.5 PERCENT.
ALL OF THE HERBS MENTIONED SO FAR SHOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT AGAINST THE
BACTERIA THAT CAUSE BODY ODOR. ONE WAY TO USE THESE DEODORANT HERBS IS TO
85
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
POWDER THEM AND RUB THEM INTO
YOUR UNDERARMS. IT'S AN EFFECTIVE
APPROACH, BUT IT MIGHT ALSO STAIN
CLOTHING. SO INSTEAD, I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING A STRONG TEA OF THE
HERB OR HERBS OF YOUR CHOICE,
SOAKING A CLOTH IN IT AND APPLYING
THE MOIST CLOTH AS A COMPRESS FOR A
FEW MINUTES.
ADD PLENTY OF SAGE, AND IF VARIOUS REASONABLY WELL-INFORMED
SOURCES ARE CORRECT, YOUR TEA MIGHT
ALSO PROVIDE ANTIPERSPIRANT BENEFIT.
YOU MIGHT ALSO USE THESE HERBS
IN A BATH. SCOOP THEM INTO A CLOTH
BAG AND RUN HOT BATHWATER OVER IT.
ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO BUY THE
ESSENTIAL OILS OF THESE HERBS, DILUTE
THEM IN VEGETABLE OIL (TRY A DROP OR
TWO OF ESSENTIAL OIL PER TABLESPOON
OF VEGETABLE OIL) AND USE THE RESULTING MIXTURE AS AN UNDERARM
MASSAGE LOTION. JUST REMEMBER THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T INGEST THE OIL, AS EVEN
A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.
MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN
HEINERMAN, PH.D., IN HEINERMAN'S
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, SUGGESTS MAKING AN ANTIPERSPIRANT SAGE TINCTURE BY STEEPING
 XA CUP DRIED, POWDERED SAGE IN 1¼ CUP VODKA.
AGE THE MIXTURE FOR TWO WEEKS, SHAKING IT TWICE A DAY, THEN STRAIN THE SAGE OUT
AND STORE THE LIQUID IN A CLEAN BOTTLE. TRY APPLYING IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY.
ALCOHOL CAN DRY THE SKIN, SO DISCONTINUE USE IF IT BECOMES IRRITATING. (YOU CAN
ALSO SIP IT AS SAGE LIQUEUR.)
V BAKING SODA AND CORNSTARCH. APPLY A MIXTURE OF THESE POWDERS IN
MALODOROUS AREAS. THE DRYING ACTION OF BOTH POWDERS HELPS, AND AS ANYONE WHO
HAS EVER USED AN OPEN BOX OF BAKING SODA TO CONTROL ODORS IN THE REFRIGERATOR
KNOWS, BAKING SODA HAS DEODORANT ACTION. I KNOW THAT BAKING SODA IS NOT AN HERB,
BUT IT'S SUCH A NATURAL APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM THAT I THOUGHT I'D INCLUDE IT.
V TURNIP JUICE. HERE IS A PERSONAL ANECDOTE FROM DR. HEINERMAN THAT I
FIND INTERESTING: AFTER A JAPANESE COLLEAGUE TOLD HIM ABOUT USING TURNIP OR
HIE POSITIVE SIDE EF BO
BODY ODOR IS REALLY A TWO-WAY STREET.
SOCIALLY AND COSMETICALLY, WE CONSIDER BO "BAD." WE BATHE FREQUENTLY TO
GET RID OF IT AND SPEND LOTS OF MONEY
TRYING TO COVER IT UP. BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT
BODY ODOR ALSO CONTAINS PHEROMONES,
MYSTERIOUS CHEMICALS THAT ATTRACT THE OPPOSITE SEX WITH THEIR SUBTLE AROMAS.
SCIENTISTS HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG
TIME THAT PHEROMONES PLAY A PRINCIPAL
ROLE IN ANIMAL MATING. BUT UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY, CONVENTIONAL SCIENTIFIC WISDOM
HELD THAT THESE CHEMICALS HAD NO AMOROUS
EFFECT ON US HUMANS. NOW STUDIES HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THAT PHEROMONES DO INDEED
PLAY A SUBTLE BUT VERY REAL ROLE IN HUMAN
ATTRACTION.
MY WIFE IS MORE APT TO TELL ME TO TAKE
A SHOWER THAN TO SNUGGLE UP TO MY
ARMPITS, BUT WHO KNOWS? MAYBE OUR
AROMAS WERE PART OF WHAT ATTRACTED US TO
EACH OTHER IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M INCLINED
TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TRUE.

BREAS T ENLARGEMEN T
DAIKON RADISH JUICE TO CONTROL BODY ODOR, DR. HEINERMAN JUICED UP SOME
TURNIPS AND BRISKLY RUBBED ONE TEASPOON UNDER EACH ARM. HIS CONCLUSION:
"TURNIP JUICE WON'T PREVENT SWEATING, BUT IT KEEPS BODY ODOR FROM OCCURRING
FOR UP TO TEN HOURS." IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, BUT I INTEND TO TRY IT IF I'M
HOME ALONE FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS AND HAVE A GOOD SUPPLY OF TURNIPS ON HAND.
V VEGETABLES CONTAINING ZINC. ZINC DEFICIENCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO BODY
ODOR. IT'S NOT EASY TO GET ZINC FROM PROCESSED FOODS, BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN REMOVED
DURING PROCESSING, BUT WHOLE FOODS CONTAIN GOOD AMOUNTS. GOOD FOOD SOURCES
OF ZINC INCLUDE SPINACH, PARSLEY, COLLARD GREENS, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CUCUMBERS,
STRING BEANS, ENDIVE, ASPARAGUS AND PRUNES. SPINACH HAS THE MOST, AND THE REST
OF THE FOODS ARE LISTED IN DESCENDING ORDER ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH ZINC THEY
CONTAIN. IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A DEODORANT COCKTAIL, CONSIDER JUICING ANY OR ALL
OF THESE VEGETABLES. (I'D LEAVE OUT THE PRUNES.)
V VINEGAR. DR. HEINERMAN RECOMMENDS USING CIDER VINEGAR IN PLACE
OF COMMERCIAL DEODORANTS. IT MAKES SENSE TO ME, BECAUSE VINEGAR IS AN
ANTISEPTIC. I ALSO STEEP SOME OF THE AROMATIC HERBS, SUCH AS SAGE, IN THE VINEGAR.
BREAST ENLARGEMENT
A
FEW YEARS AGO, I WROTE AN ARTICLE FOR HERBALGRAM, THE EXCELLENT PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN BOTANICAL COUNCIL IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, OF WHICH
MY FRIEND MARK BLUMENTHAL IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I SUMMARIZED THE RESEARCH
SHOWING THAT FENUGREEK, A TASTY, VAGUELY MAPLE-FLAVORED HERB, HELPS CONTROL
BLOOD SUGAR IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES AND THAT ITS SPROUTS JUST MIGHT ENLARGE
WOMEN'S BREASTS.
SOME TIME LATER, I WAS INVITED TO A MEETING OF HERBALISTS IN ARKANSAS.
WHEN I WAS PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT IN LITTLE ROCK, THE WOMAN WHO DROVE ME
TO THE CONFERENCE TOLD ME THIS STORY: A FEW MONTHS EARLIER, SHE AND SOME
FRIENDS HAD SPROUTED A LOT OF SEEDS FOR A TASTE TEST OF SPROUTS AT AN HERBAL FOOD
FEST. ONE OF THE SEEDS THEY SPROUTED WAS FENUGREEK.
AFTER EATING SEVERAL FAIR-SIZE PORTIONS OF FENUGREEK SPROUTS OVER THE COURSE
OF SEVERAL DAYS, ONE OF THE WOMEN NOTICED THAT HER BREASTS SEEMED SOMEWHAT
LARGER. THIS IS CALLED A MASTOGENIC EFFECT. SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS
GOING ON UNTIL ANOTHER WOMAN IN THE GROUP HANDED HER A COPY OF MY ARTICLE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BREAST ENLARGEMENT
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE SIDES ON THE ISSUE OF BREAST ENLARGEMENT. ALL I KNOW
IS THAT QUITE A FEW WOMEN DREAM OF LARGER BREASTS, AND MANY OPT FOR SILICONE
87
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IMPLANTS. IF YOU READ THE PAPERS, YOU KNOW THAT THESE IMPLANTS ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL, WITH MANY WOMEN AND SOME SCIENTISTS CALLING THEM DANGEROUS,
WHILE OTHER WOMEN AND OTHER SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THEY CAUSE NO REAL PROBLEMS.
WHILE I CAN'T JUDGE WHETHER SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ARE HARMFUL, I KNOW
THAT IF MY DAUGHTER WANTED HER BREASTS ENLARGED, I'D CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE HER
TO TRY NATURAL APPROACHES FIRST. HERE ARE SEVERAL HERBS THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL
IN PROVIDING A MODEST BOOST IN SIZE.
W V FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). THE SEEDS AND SPROUTS
HAVE A CENTURIES-OLD FOLK REPUTATION AS BREAST ENLARGERS. IN FACT, 100 YEARS AGO
THE HERB WAS A KEY INGREDIENT IN THE ORIGINAL FORMULA FOR LYDIA PINKHAM'S VEGETABLE COMPOUND, A POPULAR REMEDY FOR "FEMALE TROUBLES"—EVERYTHING FROM
MENSTRUAL PAIN TO POSTMENOPAUSAL VAGINAL DRYNESS.
AS I LEARNED IN ARKANSAS, THERE ARE ALSO MODERN TESTIMONIALS FOR FENU-
^ | GREEK'S EFFECTS ON THE BREASTS AND GOOD
TO BELIEVE THIS HERB REALLY
VF ANT A BUSTIER LOOK? DRINK BUSTEA! HERE'S
A TEA RECIPE THAT WILL GIVE YOU A HEARTY DOSE
OF BREAST-ENHANCING HERBS.
IN A SAUCEPAN, POUR TWO CUPS OF WATER
OVER ONE CUP OF FENUGREEK SPROUTS. ADD A
DASH OR TWO OF ANISE, BASIL, CARAWAY, DILL,
FENNEL, LICORICE, MARJORAM AND LEMONGRASS.
BRING TO A BOIL, THEN LET COOL. ADD LEMON
JUICE AND HONEY TO TASTE. DRINK ONE TO TWO
CUPS A DAY.
FENNEL CONTAINS PHYTOESTROGENS,
PLANT CHEMICALS SIMILAR TO THE FEMALE HORMONE ESTROGEN. FOLKLORE MAINTAINS THAT
THE OTHER HERBS IN THIS TEA CAN ALSO HELP
ENLARGE THE BREASTS.
REASON
WORKS.
FENUGREEK SEEDS CONTAIN A FAIR
AMOUNT OF DIOSGENIN, A CHEMICAL COMPOUND THAT'S OFTEN USED TO CREATE SEMISYNTHETIC FORMS OF THE FEMALE SEX
HORMONE ESTROGEN.
WHILE ESTROGEN HAS MANY EFFECTS
ON THE BODY, TWO RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO
BREAST ENLARGEMENT. THE HORMONE
CAUSES GROWTH OF BREAST CELLS AND CONTRIBUTES TO WATER RETENTION. IN FACT,
MANY WOMEN WHO TAKE THE PILL, WHICH
CONTAINS ESTROGEN, FOR BIRTH CONTROL
OFTEN EXPERIENCE AS A SIDE EFFECT THE
FEELING OF BREAST FULLNESS CAUSED BY
OJ WATER RETENTION.
PLANT ESTROGEN (PHYTOESTROGEN)
FROM SOURCES LIKE FENUGREEK DOES NOT LEAD TO UNCOMFORTABLE BREAST FULLNESS. IF
MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO TRY FENUGREEK, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT SHE DRINK A FORMULA
THAT I DEVELOPED FOR EXACTLY THIS PURPOSE. I CALL IT BUSTEA.
MASSAGING POWDERED FENUGREEK INTO THE BREASTS IS ALSO WORTH A TRY, SINCE
BREAST TISSUE CAN APPARENTLY ABSORB A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PLANT CHEMICALS. NOT
TOO LONG AGO, TWO DISTINGUISHED PHARMACOGNOSISTS (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACISTS) PUBLISHED A PAPER ENTIDED "HIGHER PLANTS AS POTENTIAL SOURCES OF GALACSS
BREAS T ENLARGEMEN T
TAGOGUES." (GALACTAGOGUES ARE SUBSTANCES THAT PROMOTE THE SECRETION AND FLOW
OF BREAST MILK.) THESE TWO SCIENTISTS SEEMED SURPRISED TO FIND THAT 68 OF THE
255 PLANTS USED AS TRADITIONAL GALACTAGOGUES WERE AND ARE APPLIED TOPICALLY.
TO USE POWDERED FENUGREEK, GRIND UP SEEDS OR SPROUTS IN A BLENDER, ADD A
DASH OF VEGETABLE OIL AND APPLY THE MIXTURE AS A PASTE.
V*, FENNEL (FOENICULUM VULGARE). FENNEL IS ANOTHER ESTROGENIC HERB
THAT HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO PROMOTE MILK PRODUCTION. YOU COULD INCLUDE
IT IN BUSTEA TO COMPLEMENT THE FENUGREEK. DON'T USE FENNEL OIL, HOWEVER. IN
PREGNANT WOMEN, THE OIL CAN CAUSE MISCARRIAGE. AND IN DOSES GREATER THAN
ABOUT A TEASPOON, IT CAN BE TOXIC.
V*, SAW PALMETTO {SERENOA REPENS). THIS PLANT IS BEST KNOWN THESE
DAYS FOR ITS ABILITY TO SHRINK AN ENLARGED PROSTATE GLAND IN MEN. BUT A CENTURY
AGO, THIS HERB WAS BEST KNOWN AS A FOLK APPROACH TO
BREAST ENLARGEMENT. NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS « ^
CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND IT FOR THIS PURPOSE.
MOST PEOPLE USE STANDARDIZED STORE-BOUGHT
CAPSULES (ONE TO TWO GRAMS) OR ALCOHOL EX- ,
TRACTS. TO USE THIS HERB, FOLLOW THE PACKAGE
DIRECTIONS.
^*> WILD YAM (DIOSCOREA VILLOSA).
HERE'S ANOTHER HERB THAT IS REPUTED TO HAVE ESTROGENIC EFFECTS. PERSONALLY, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THAT IMPRESSED WITH WILD YAM BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, IT CONTAINS A LOT LESS
DIOSGENIN THAN FENUGREEK. BUT I BOW TO PRACTICING HERBALISTS SUCH AS SUSUN WEED, AUTHOR OF
BREAST CANCER? BREAST HEALTH! WHO SAY THAT
THEY HAVE MADE SALVES OUT OF THE WILD YAM.
THESE HERBALISTS MAINTAIN THAT THE WOMEN WHO
USE THIS SALVE GAIN THE DESIRED EFFECTS. TO MAKE
A SALVE, IT'S BEST TO SHAVE OFF THE OUTER BARK OF
THE ROOT AND REDUCE THE INNER ROOT BARK TO PASTE
IN A BLENDER.
V CUMIN (CUMIMUN CYMINUM). BOTH COMMON CUMIN AND BLACK CUMIN
(NIGELLA SATIVA) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MAMMARY CELLS IN
LABORATORY ANIMALS. THE HERB'S EFFECTS ON THE HUMAN BREAST ARE UNKNOWN, BUT
MAMMALS TEND TO HAVE SIMILAR REACTIONS TO COMPOUNDS WITH MAMMARY EFFECTS.
YOU COULD SPICE UP BUSTEA WITH MORE GROUND CUMIN. YOU COULD ALSO MAKE LIBERAL USE OF THIS SPICE IN COOKING.
WILD YAM
ALSO CALLED COLIC ROOT OR
RHEUMATISM ROOT, WILD YAM
IS A TWINING PERENNIAL THAT
WAS ONCE USED BY AMERICAN
INDIANS TO EASE THE PAIN OF
CHILDBIRTH.

BREASTREEDINGF PROBLEMS
I
WAS BOM IN RURAL ALABAMA, AND I SPENT MY FIRST FEW MONTHS BREASTFEEDING
FROM BOTH MY MOTHER AND A BLACK WET NURSE. WET NURSES IN RURAL ALABAMA
TOOK HERBS TO PROMOTE LACTATION, PARTICULARLY FENNEL AND FENUGREEK. BASED ON MY
REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, I'D HAVE TO VOTE FOR FENUGREEK OVER FENNEL. BUT
IT NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME HOW MUCH WISDOM THERE IS IN FOLK WISDOM.
COMPARED WITH FORMULA, MOTHER'S MILK IS BETTER FOR MOTHER-CHILD BONDING,
PLUS IT IS EASIER FOR BABIES TO DIGEST, DOES NOT CAUSE CONSTIPATION AND PROTECTS
THE INFANT FROM ALLERGIES AND SEVERAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES. IT ALSO HAS CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS FOR THE MOTHER, ALTHOUGH NURSING WOMEN CAN GET PREGNANT. FOR
ALL OF THESE REASONS, AND AFTER YEARS OF TOUTING FORMULA, SINCE THE 1980S DOCTORS HAVE SWITCHED BACK TO PROMOTING BREASTFEEDING. (ANOTHER CASE OF MODERN
MEDICINE REVERSING ITSELF. SCIENCE MARCHES ON!) IN FACT, A NEW TYPE OF SPECIALIST, LACTATION CONSULTANT, HAS SPRUNG UP TO HELP NEW MOTHERS DEAL WITH
BREASTFEEDING PROBLEMS: TOO LITTLE MILK, TOO MUCH MILK, SORE NIPPLES AND
PAINFUL NIPPLE INFECTIONS (MASTITIS).
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BREASTFEEDING PROBLEMS
I'M NO LACTATION CONSULTANT, BUT PERMIT ME TO SUGGEST A FEW HERBS THAT CAN
HELP MAKE BREASTFEEDING A MORE REWARDING EXPERIENCE.
V * ^ FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENIUN-GRAECUM). FENUGREEK SEED HAS BEEN
USED TO INCREASE MILK PRODUCTION SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES. THE HERB CONTAINS
PHYTOESTROGENS, WHICH ARE PLANT CHEMICALS SIMILAR TO THE
FEMALE SEX HORMONE ESTROGEN. A KEY COMPOUND, DIOSGENIN, HAS BEEN SHOWN EXPERIMENTALLY TO INCREASE MILK
FLOW. I WOULD READILY WAGER THAT DIETARY LEVELS CONSUMED IN SOME SOCIETIES—PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST,
FOR EXAMPLE—COULD BE SHOWN TO INCREASE MILK FLOW.
BECAUSE FENUGREEK IS MY FIRST-CHOICE HERB FOR
PROMOTING MILK PRODUCTION, IT IS ALSO THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN MY BUSTEA, WHICH I ALSO RECOMMEND FOR BREAST
ENLARGEMENT. YOU CAN FIND THE RECIPE ON PAGE 88.
V \ V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). TO TREAT MASTITIS,
DOCTORS OFTEN PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT
ANTIBIOTICS GET INTO BREAST MILK, AND FM NOT SO SURE IT'S
A GOOD IDEA TO EXPOSE INFANTS TO THESE DRUGS.
FENUGREEK
ALSO KNOWN AS GREEK
HAY, FENUGREEK HAS
LONG BEEN USED TO HEAL
SICK ANIMALS AS WELL AS
HUMANS.
90
BREASTFEEDIN G PROBLEM S
MISSOURI NATUROPATH CHRIS DEATHERIDGE, N.D., HAS WHAT I THINK IS A BETTER
APPROACH. HE SUGGESTS MIXING A DROPPERFUL OF ECHINACEA TINCTURE, THREE CLOVES
OF RAW GARLIC AND FOUR TO SIX OUNCES OF CARROT JUICE IN A BLENDER AND DRINKING THE
MIXTURE EVERY TWO HOURS. HE REPORTS MANY QUICK, PERMANENT CURES. I'M NOT SURPRISED. GARLIC IS A POTENT ANTIBIOTIC.
IN ADDITION, GARLIC HELPS BABIES NURSE BETTER. IF BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS EAT A
FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC WITHIN AN HOUR BEFORE NURSING BEGINS, BABIES ATTACH TO THE
BREAST MORE READILY, STAY THERE LONGER, SUCK MORE AND DRINK MORE MILK, ACCORDING
TO STUDIES DONE AT THE MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA.
VV ANISE (PUNPINEUA ANISUM). ANISE IS VERY HELPFUL IN PROMOTING LACTATION, ACCORDING TO JEAN VALNET, M.D., A PIONEER OF AROMATHERAPY AND AUTHOR OF
THE PRACTICE OF AROMATHERAPY. DR. VALNET ALSO RECOMMENDS CARAWAY, FENNEL AND
LEMONGRASS. HE'S A BIT SURER THAN I AM, BUT I'M INCLINED TO ACCEPT HIS RECOMMENDATIONS, WHICH IS WHY ALL OF THESE HERBS ARE INCORPORATED INTO MY BUSTEA.
THEY ALSO IMPROVE THE FLAVOR OF THE ACTIVE FENUGREEK.
V V CHASTEBERRY (VUEX AGNUS-CASTUS). TALENTED FOURTH-GENERATION CALIFORNIA HERBALIST CHRISTOPHER HOBBS, A BOTANIST WHOM I RESPECT, SUGGESTS USING
VITEX SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY TO PROMOTE MILK FLOW. THIS RECOMMENDATION GOES A BIT
BEYOND THE USUAL USES OF CHASTEBERRY FOR BREAST TENDERNESS, PMS AND MENSTRUAL
COMPLAINTS, BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM SUGGESTING THIS REVERED WOMEN'S HERB TO ENHANCE LACTATION. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH A TRY. (AND IT'S A HANDSOME ORNAMENTAL FLOWERING TREE, AS LOVELY AS LILAC.)
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN AS
CONEFLOWER, IS USEFUL IN TREATING MASTITIS AND NIPPLE FISSURES, ACCORDING TO MAINE
HERBALIST DEB SOULE, FOUNDER OF AVENA BOTANICALS AND AUTHOR OF THE ROOTS OF
HEALING. I'M NOT SURPRISED AT THIS RECOMMENDATION, BECAUSE ECHINACEA IS BOTH
AN ANTIBIOTIC AND AN IMMUNE SYSTEM BOOSTER.
I SUGGEST BLENDING A DROPPERFUL OF ECHINACEA TINCTURE IN JUICE ALONG WITH A
FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC; DRINK IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN
CAUSE THE TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
^¼. FENNEL (FOENICULUM VULGARE). FENNEL, WHICH RESEARCH SHOWS HAS
WEAK PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE STRONGER FEMALE HORMONE ESTROGEN, HAS
BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO PROMOTE LACTATION. YOU CAN TRY TWO TEASPOONS OF
CRUSHED SEEDS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND DRINK UP TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
DON'T USE FENNEL OIL. IN PREGNANT WOMEN, THE OIL CAN CAUSE MISCARRIAGE.
AND IN DOSES GREATER THAN ABOUT A TEASPOON, IT CAN BE TOXIC.
W PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). IN CHINA, WHEN WOMEN PRODUCE LITTLE
MILK, HERBALISTS GIVE THEM PEANUTS. THERE JUST MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO IT. LIKE
91
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SO MANY OTHER LEGUMES, PEANUTS CONTAIN SEVERAL ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS THAT
MIGHT SPUR MILK PRODUCTION.
V ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SALIVA). LIKE FENUGREEK, ALFALFA IS ESTROGENIC. IF
YOU'D LIKE TO PRODUCE MORE MILK, IT PROBABLY CAN'T HURT TO ADD HEAPING HANDIULS
OF SPROUTS TO YOUR SALADS. IF YOU HAVE LUPUS OR A FAMILY HISTORY OF LUPUS, HOWEVER, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO STEER CLEAR OF ALFALFA SPROUTS. THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE
THAT THEY MAY TRIGGER LUPUS IN SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.
V DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE)* THE CHINESE BOIL ABOUT AN OUNCE
OF MINCED DANDELION ROOT IN TWO TO THREE CUPS OF
WATER UNTIL ONLY HALF THE LIQUID REMAINS, THEN USE
COMPRESSES OF THE RESULTING BREW TO TREAT MASTITIS.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TREATMENT TO ME. IF MY
DAUGHTER HAD MASTITIS, I'D SUGGEST THAT SHE TRY IT.
V JASMINE (JASMINUM SAMBAC). TO SUPPRESS MILK FLOW, AN AGE-OLD INDIAN FOLK TREATMENT IS
TO APPLY FRESH JASMINE FLOWERS TO THE BREASTS. IN ONE
STUDY, INDIAN RESEARCHERS MATCHED THIS TREATMENT
AGAINST DOSES OF BROMOCRIPTINE (PARLODEL), A DRUG THAT
TERMINATES LACTATION BY INHIBITING SECRETION OF A HORMONE INVOLVED IN MILK PRODUCTION. IN THE STUDY, HALF
OF A GROUP OF WOMEN TOOK BROMOCRIPTINE, AND HALF APPLIED CRUSHED JASMINE TO THEIR BREASTS. BOTH TREATMENTS WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE LACTATION INHIBITORS,
ALTHOUGH BROMOCRIPTINE LOWERED HORMONE LEVELS
MORE THAN THE FLOWERS DID. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS COULD
WORK, BUT THAT'S WHAT THE STUDY SHOWED.
V PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CRISPUM). EATING
CHOPPED FRESH PARSLEY IS AN OLD FOLK TREATMENT FOR BREAST TENDERNESS. IT MAKES
SENSE: SOME BREAST TENDERNESS IS CAUSED BY WATER RETENTION, AND PARSLEY IS DIURETIC, WHICH MEANS THAT IT HELPS FLUSH EXCESS WATER FROM THE BODY.
THE HERB'S DIURETIC ACTION PROBABLY ACCOUNTS FOR DR. VALNET'S RECOMMENDATION TO USE PARSLEY TO HELP REDUCE MILK PRODUCTION IN PREPARATION FOR WEANING.
HE ALSO RECOMMENDS MINT AND SAGE FOR THIS PURPOSE.
V SESAME (SESAMUM INDICUM). THE CHINESE ROAST SESAME SEEDS, GRIND
THEM AND THEN EAT THEM WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF SALT TO INCREASE MILK FLOW. I LOVE
SESAME SEEDS AND CAN THINK OF NO MORE WHOLESOME FOOD. WHILE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT IT WORKS, I CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD REASON NOT TO GIVE IT A TRY.
ALFALFA
ALFALFA, A FAVORITE FOOD
FOR CATTLE, MAY HELP STIMULATE MILK PRODUCTION.
92
BRONCHITI S
V SQUAW VINE (MITCHELLA REPENS). THIS HERB IS USEFUL IN TREATING NIPPLE
SORENESS THAT RESULTS FROM NURSING, ACCORDING TO HERBALIST PAUL BERGNER, EDITOR OF
MEDICAL HERBALISM. HIS RECIPE: BOIL TWO OUNCES OF SQUAW VINE IN A PINT OF WATER,
ADD A PINT OF HEAVY CREAM, THEN BOIL THE MIXTURE DOWN UNTIL IT HAS THE CONSISTENCY OF A SALVE. LET COOL AND APPLY AFTER EACH FEEDING.
BRONCHITIS
I
'M NOT PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE TV NEWSMAN WALTER CRONKITE, BUT
HE AND I HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. OVER A DECADE AGO, ON INDEPENDENT TRIPS TO CHINA, OUR HOSTS GAVE BOTH OF US HONEYSUCKLE TEA. I WAS GIVEN THE
TEA FOR FLU. HE GOT THE TEA FOR BRONCHITIS, THE INFLAMMATION OF THE BRONCHIAL
TUBES THAT CAUSES PERSISTENT COUGH, CHEST CONGESTION AND OFTEN THE PRODUCTION
OF A LOT OF THICK, STICKY PHLEGM.
BOTH OF US RECOVERED QUICKLY, AND FM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ANCIENT
HERBAL REMEDY HELPED. DOCTORS TEND TO SCOFF AT SUCH STATEMENTS. OUR TWO CASE
STUDIES ARE MERELY WHAT THE SCIENTISTS OFTEN DISMISS AS ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE.
STUDY CONRIRMS FOLK CURES
ALL RIGHT, SO OUR CASES DON'T REALLY PROVE ANYTHING. BUT THERE'S MORE TO HONEYSUCKLE—AND OTHER HERBS—THAN JUST ANECDOTES. AND THESE DAYS, THERE ARE A
LOT OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO BACK THAT UP. IN 1993, FOR EXAMPLE, CHINESE RESEARCHERS DIVIDED 96 CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIOLITIS, A CHILDREN'S FORM OF BRONCHITIS, INTO THREE GROUPS.
ONE-THIRD OF THE CHILDREN WERE GIVEN THE HERBAL FORMULA SHUANG HUANG
LIAN, WHICH CONSISTS OF HONEYSUCKLE, FORSYTHIA AND SKULLCAP. ANOTHER THIRD GOT
ONLY ANTIBIOTICS, AND THE REMAINING THIRD WERE GIVEN BOTH HERBS AND ANTIBIOTICS.
THE CHILDREN WHO WERE GIVEN THE HERBS ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN CHEST
SYMPTOMS, COUGH, FEVER AND WHEEZING. COMPARED WITH THOSE ON ANTIBIOTICS, THE
HERBS-ONLY GROUP FARED BETTER IN SOME WAYS: THEY HAD FEWER DAYS WITH FEVER AND
LESS WHEEZING AND COUGHING. NO ADVERSE REACTIONS TO THE HERBS WERE NOTED.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS, TO MY WAY OF THINKING, IS THAT THE HERBAL
INFUSION WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY FOR SEVEN DAYS. NOWHERE DO I RECOMMEND HERBAL INJECTIONS. FOR TREATING BRONCHITIS, TAKING HERBS IN THE FORM OF TEA
OR TINCTURES IS SAFE AND OFTEN QUITE EFFECTIVE.
93
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
AND TELL YOUR DOCTOR TO SAVE THE ANTIBIOTICS FOR EMERGENCIES. THE DOWNSIDE OF
ANTIBIOTICS IS THAT THEY MAKE ANY "BUGS" THAT SURVIVE MORE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT.
THIS CHINESE STUDY IS GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ME CONFIDENCE IN SUGGESTING HONEYSUCKLE AND FORSYTHIA AS TREATMENTS FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT CONFIRMS CENTURIES OF FOLKLORIC USE. BUT APPARENTLY IT HASN'T BUDGED THE FOOD AND
DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), WHICH DOES NOT LIST EITHER HONEYSUCKLE OR FORSYTHIA
ON THE LIST OF HERBS GENERALLY REGARDED AS SAFE (GRAS), LET ALONE AS TREATMENTS
FOR BRONCHITIS. THE WAYS OF THE FDA ARE A MYSTERY TO ME. I REGARD HONEYSUCKLE
AND FORSYTHIA AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE, AND I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO USE THEM FOR BRONCHITIS AND THE CHEST CONGESTION OF COLDS AND FLU. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GRAS,
ALL I CAN SAY TO OTHER PEOPLE IS, TRY THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK.
BRONCHITIS HAS SEVERAL POSSIBLE CAUSES. IT MAY BE BACTERIAL OR VIRAL, OR IT MAY
BE CAUSED BY SOME CHRONIC IRRITANT SUCH AS CIGARETTE SMOKING OR EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN CHEMICALS. CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP BRONCHITIS (AND ASTHMA) IF
THEIR PARENTS SMOKE OR IF THEY ARE EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF FORMALDEHYDE, ONE OF
THE CHEMICALS THAT GIVE CARS AND HOME FURNISHINGS THAT "NEW" SMELL. SOMETIMES
THE GERMS AND IRRITANTS WORK TOGETHER: A SMOKER CATCHES A COLD AND THE COUGH
TURNS INTO BRONCHITIS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BRONCHITIS
BRONCHITIS MAY CLEAR UP BY ITSELF WITHOUT ANY TREATMENT, BUT IT CAN ALSO LINGER
AND SOMETIMES BECOME CHRONIC. THAT'S WHY I FAVOR TREATING IT. HONEYSUCKLE
(LONICERAJAPONICD) AND FORSYTHIA (FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA) ARE TWO OF MY FAVORITE NATURAL BRONCHITIS REMEDIES, BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS. HERE ARE SOME TO TRY.
W EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS). EUCALYPTUS OIL IS A GOOD EXPECTORANT (A SUBSTANCE THAT HELPS LOOSEN PHLEGM). COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF NATURAL MEDICINE EXPERTS THAT MAKES HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO GERMANY'S HEALTH
ADVISERS, HAS ENDORSED INHALING EUCALYPTUS VAPORS TO TREAT BRONCHITIS AND COUGHS.
TAKEN INTERNALLY, EUCALYPTUS LEAF TEA MIGHT HAVE THE SAME BENEFITS. I SAY
THIS BECAUSE, AFTER YOU INGEST EUCALYPTUS AND YOUR BODY ABSORBS IT, PART OF ITS
ESSENTIAL OIL IS SECRETED THROUGH YOUR LUNGS. SO YOU GET THE ANTISEPTIC, COOLING
AND EXPECTORANT PROPERTIES OF EUCALYPTUS RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED THEM.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). EATING A LOT OF GARLIC CAN HELP PREVENT BRONCHITIS BECAUSE GARLIC IS FILLED WITH CHEMICALS THAT ARE ANTIVIRAL AND ANTIBACTERIAL.
GARLIC MAY ALSO PROTECT YOU FROM COLDS AND FLU BECAUSE "GARLIC BREATH" KEEPS
PEOPLE FROM GETTING TOO CLOSE TO YOU, (JUST JOKING!) ACTUALLY, THERE IS A SERIOUS SIDE TO
GARLIC BREATH THAT SERVES TO DEMONSTRATE JUST HOW USEFUL THIS HERB IS IN TREATING RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS. IN THE BODY, GARLIC RELEASES AROMATIC CHEMICALS, INCLUDING ALLICIN, ONE OF THE MOST POTENT BROAD-SPECTRUM PLANT ANTISEPTICS. THESE AROMATIC
COMPOUNDS ARE EXCRETED THROUGH THE LUNGS—HENCE GARLIC BREATH. THE PRESENCE OF
94
BRONCHITI S
THESE COMPOUNDS IN THE LUNGS IS GOOD. IT MEANS THAT, AS WITH EUCALYPTUS, YOU GET
GARLIC'S ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED THEM.
TO MINIMIZE GARLIC BREATH, YOU CAN CHEW ON A FEW SPRIGS OF PARSLEY.
W MULLEIN (VERBETSCUM THAPSIIS). MULLEIN HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY COMMISSION E FOR RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS BECAUSE IT HAS EXPECTORANT PROPERTIES. IT CAN
HELP BRING UP THAT STICKY PHLEGM. IN FACT, MULLEIN HAS BEEN AN HERBAL FAVORITE FOR
RESPIRATORY AILMENTS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IN ADDITION TO ITS EXPECTORANT ACTION, IT
SOOTHES THE THROAT, HAS BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY AND HELPS STOP THE MUSCLE SPASMS THAT
TRIGGER COUGHS. ,
W STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA).
IN RECENT YEARS, NETTLE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY
TOUTED FOR TREATING BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA AND HAY
FEVER—AND WITH GOOD REASON. THE JUICE OF THE
ROOTS AND LEAVES, MIXED WITH HONEY OR SUGAR,
RELIEVES BOTH BRONCHITIS AND ASTHMA. TRY TWO
TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING
WATER AND STEEP UNTIL COOL.
V COUCHGRASS (AGROPYRON REPENS
OR ELYMUS REPENS). THIS HERB IS ALSO
KNOWN BY AN IRONIC NAME, QUACKGRASS, WHICH
I LOVE. DESPITE ITS NAME, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT A
QUACK REMEDY. IT WORKS AND HAS LONG BEEN
USED FOR RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS. COMMISSION
E RECOGNIZES COUCHGRASS AS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR RESPIRATORY INFLAMMATIONS, INCLUDING
BRONCHITIS.
V ENGLISH PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO
LANCEOLATA). THIS HERB AND ITS PLANTAIN RELATIVES HAVE A WORLDWIDE REPUTATION AS COUGH
SUPPRESSANTS. COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS IT
AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR BRONCHIAL CONDITIONS.
AS A BONUS, IT HAS ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION. YOU
MAY USE ABOUT ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB
PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEP UNTIL COOL.
V HOREHOUND (MARRUBIUM VULGARE). COMMISSION E ENDORSED HOREHOUND FOR BRONCHIAL COMPLAINTS, SO WHY DID THE FDA DECLARE IT INEFFECTIVE
AGAINST COUGHS? BEATS ME.
PERSONALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO HERBAL MEDICINE, I'D BELIEVE COMMISSION E
OVER THE FDA ANY DAY. HERBAL MEDICINE IS FAR MORE MAINSTREAM IN GERMANY
THAN IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND COMMISSION E BASES ITS RECOMMENDATIONS
STINGING NETTLE
THIS PLANT DOES STING, BUT THE
LEAVES, ROOTS AND EVEN NETTLES
(WHEN SOFTENED BY BOILING) HAVE
HEALING POWERS.
95
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
ON SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. FOR BRONCHITIS, I SUGGEST BREWING A STRONG HOREHOUND TEA WITH LEMON AND LICORICE. TRY TWO TEASPOONS OF HOREHOUND PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER.
V IVY (HEDERA HELIX). IVY IS ALSO USEFUL FOR TREATING BRONCHITIS AND OTHER
RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E.
V KNOTGRASS (POLYGONUM AVICULARE). THIS IS ANOTHER HERB WITH COMMISSION E ENDORSEMENT. THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS KNOTGRASS FOR SORE THROAT
AND RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING BRONCHITIS.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS) AND OTHER MALLOWS. THE MALLOWS ARE GOOD RESPIRATORY TRACT SOOTHERS (DEMULCENTS), ACCORDING TO COMMISSION
E. MARSH MALLOW IS PARTICULARLY GOOD BECAUSE ITS DEMULCENT ROOTS ALSO HAVE AN
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT. THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS WHY THIS HERB HAS BEEN USED
FOR CENTURIES AS A TREATMENT FOR BRONCHITIS, COLDS, COUGHS AND SORE THROAT.
V PRIMROSE (PRIMULA VERIS). HERE'S YET ANOTHER HERBAL ENDORSEMENT
FROM COMMISSION E. I KNOW THAT I MENTION THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS A LOT FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS, BUT A NOD FROM THIS BODY OF SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE VIEWED WITH
RESPECT. THEIR RESEARCH SUGGESTS USING ABOUT ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED PRIMROSE
FLOWERS OR A HALF-TEASPOON OF ROOT IN TEA AS AN EXPECTORANT FOR TREATING BRONCHITIS, COLDS AND COUGH. I SHOULD POINT OUT ALSO THAT THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR PRIMROSE, NOT EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS), WHICH SHOWS
UP SO OFTEN ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK.
V SOAPWORT (SAPONARIA OFFICINALIS). THE ROOT OF THIS HERB IS A GOOD
EXPECTORANT FOR TREATING RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BRONCHITIS, ACCORDING
TO COMMISSION E. CHEMICALS IN THE PLANT—SAPONINS—REPORTEDLY HAVE PAIN-RELIEVING AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION, BESIDES HELPING OTHER COMPOUNDS GET THE
JOB DONE. TO MAKE A TEA, USE ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER
AND STEEP UNTIL COOL.
V HERBAL FORMULAS. YOU CAN USE ANY OF THE HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS
CHAPTER SINGLY IF YOU'D LIKE, BUT MOST HERBALISTS RECOMMEND USING THEM IN
COMBINATION. A NOTED BRITISH HERBALIST WHOM I RESPECT, DAVID HOFFMANN,
AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, SUGGESTS USING EQUAL PARTS OF HOREHOUND,
MULLEIN AND ELECAMPANE. (ELECAMPANE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE AS AN ANTISEPTIC AND EXPECTORANT.)
ANOTHER FORMULA THAT YD TRY FOR BRONCHITIS CONTAINS HOREHOUND, MULLEIN,
PLANTAIN, CAYENNE, CHICKWEED, KELP, LICORICE, PLEURISY ROOT, SAW PALMETTO
BERRIES, SLIPPERY ELM BARK AND WILD CHERRY BARK. AMERICAN INDIANS USED THESE
HERBS FOR RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS.
IN ADDITION TO USING HERBS THAT TREAT BRONCHITIS, I'D ALSO SUGGEST USING ECHINACEA, WHICH ENHANCES IMMUNITY.
96
BRUISES
AS A SNACK TO MUNCH ALONG WITH YOUR HERBAL FORMULA OF CHOICE, YOU CAN
MIX UP SOME OF MY BURNING BRONCHO-BUSTER SPREAD. TO MAKE IT, MIX GARLIC,
GINGER, MUSTARD, TURMERIC, CHILI PEPPERS AND HORSERADISH OR WASABI. START WITH
JUST A LITTLE OF EACH AND EXPERIMENT UNTIL YOU FIND A COMBINATION YOU CAN LIVE
WITH. I MUST WARN YOU, HOWEVER, THAT THIS HERBAL FORMULA IS VERY HOT. IT WILL OPEN
YOUR SINUSES AS WELL AS YOUR BRONCHIAL TUBES.
I'M SERIOUS ABOUT IT, THOUGH. IF YOU CAN HANDLE THE HEAT, A LITTLE OF THIS MIXTURE SPREAD ON CRACKERS OR BREAD WILL REALLY HELP. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A PIPING
HOT TEA CONTAINING ANY OR ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS.
V PLANTS CONTAINING VITAMIN C. IN STUDIES, HOSPITAL PATIENTS WITH BRONCHITIS RECOVERED FASTER WHEN THEY TOOK VITAMIN C SUPPLEMENTS. DAILY SUPPLEMENTS
OF 500 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO HELP WITH ALLERGIES AND
ASTHMA, SO THERE'S CLEARLY A LINK BETWEEN USING THIS VITAMIN AND A REDUCTION IN
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS, NASAL CONGESTION AND WATERY EYES.
I FEEL FINE ABOUT RECOMMENDING VITAMIN C SUPPLEMENTS, BUT I FEEL EVEN
BETTER ABOUT ENDORSING PLANT FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN THIS IMPORTANT VITAMIN, SUCH
AS RED AND GREEN PEPPERS, CITRUS FRUITS AND CHILI PEPPERS.
V WHOLE GRAINS, NUTS AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING MAGNESIUM.
SPEAKING OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS, THE RISK FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASES SUCH AS BRONCHITIS INCREASES AS MAGNESIUM LEVELS DECLINE. THE MORE MAGNESIUM IN THE BODY,
THE LESS WHEEZING AND OTHER RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS. NATUROPATHS COMMONLY RECOMMEND TAKING 300 TO 600 MILLIGRAMS DAILY AS A PREVENTIVE, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A
GOOD IDEA TO ME. YOU MIGHT ALSO EAT MORE FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN MAGNESIUM, SUCH
AS WHOLE GRAINS, SOYBEANS, NUTS, FISH, DAIRY PRODUCTS AND LEAN MEATS.
BRUISES
Y
OU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF USING RAW BEEFSTEAK TO TREAT BLACK EYES AND
OTHER BAD BRUISES. BUT WHAT ABOUT PINEAPPLE? IF THE TROPICAL FRUIT
WORKED ON BOXERS' BRUISES, WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED?
TWO PHYSICIANS I RESPECT—MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF
MEDICINE, AND NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHORS OF BOTANICAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS—BOTH SEEM IMPRESSED BY AN OLD STUDY ON BROMELAIN, A PROTEIN-DIGESTING (PROTEOLYTIC) ENZYME IN PINEAPPLE, FOR TREATING BRUISES.
97
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IN THIS STUDY, RESEARCHERS GAVE BROMELAIN TO 74 BOXERS WITH NUMEROUS
BRUISES, WHILE 72 OTHER BRUISED BOXERS RECEIVED AN INACTIVE SUBSTITUTE
(PLACEBO). AMONG THOSE RECEIVING THE PLACEBO, 14 PERCENT HEALED IN FOUR DAYS.
BUT AMONG THE BOXERS TAKING BROMELAIN, 78 PERCENT HEALED IN FOUR DAYS.
HOW DOES IT WORK? BROMELAIN APPEARS TO INHIBIT THE FORMATION OF
PROSTAGLANDIN E2, A CHEMICAL IN THE BODY THAT IS INVOLVED IN INFLAMMATION. AT
THE SAME TIME, IT STIMULATES THE PRODUCTION OF PROSTAGLANDIN E P AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CHEMICAL.
PINEAPPLE'S N O PANACEA
THOSE BLACK-AND-BLUE MARKS KNOWN AS BRUISES ARE ACTUALLY CAUSED BY
BLOOD THAT LEAKS OUT OF CAPILLARIES JUST UNDER THE SKIN, USUALLY AFTER AN INJURY.
BLACK EYES ARE MORE COMMON IN MEN THAN WOMEN, WHILE BLUE SPOTS OCCUR MOST
FREQUENTLY ON THE LEGS OF OLDER WOMEN.
IF I WERE A CHARLATAN, I COULD PUSH PINEAPPLE JUICE OR PINEAPPLE CONCENTRATE AS A TREATMENT FOR THIS CONDITION. THE PRESS RELEASES WOULD BE FUN TO WRITE:
"RECENT STUDY CONFIRMS THE FOLKLORE: PINEAPPLE TAKES THE PURPLE OUT OF
PUGILISTS' PUNCHED PUPILS."
I'M NOT THAT STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF BROMELAIN, HOWEVER. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK
PINEAPPLE AND BROMELAIN REPRESENT THE BEST NATURAL APPROACH TO EITHER THE PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF BRUISES. BROMELAIN OCCURS IN VERY LOW LEVELS IN
PINEAPPLE, AND ONLY ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF IT GETS FROM THE DIGESTIVE TRACT TO OTHER
PARTS OF THE BODY.
THEN, HOW ABOUT PURE BROMELAIN? AFTER ALL, YOU CAN BUY IT AT MANY NATURAL FOOD STORES. NATUROPATHS, WHO ARE BIG ON BROMELAIN, SUGGEST TAKING 150 TO
450 MILLIGRAMS THREE TIMES A DAY ON AN EMPTY STOMACH TO TREAT BRUISES, MANY
SPORTS INJURIES, SWELLING AND INFLAMMATION.
PERHAPS IT IS AS EFFECTIVE AS THE NATUROPATHS SAY, BUT PERSONALLY I'D SUGGEST
FRUITS THAT ARE RICH IN VITAMIN C AND BIOFLAVONOIDS, SUCH AS ORANGES AND OTHER
CITRUS FRUITS. BIOFLAVONOIDS ARE BENEFICIAL NUTRIENTS THAT OFTEN SHOW UP IN FOODS
THAT ARE RICH IN VITAMIN C, AND TOGETHER THESE NUTRIENTS HELP STRENGTHEN CAPILLARY WALLS, MAKING THEM MORE RESISTANT TO THE BLOOD LEAKAGE THAT CAUSES
BRUISES. WHEN BRUISES OCCUR, VITAMIN C AND BIOFLAVONOIDS HELP CAPILLARY
WALLS—AND BLACK-AND-BLUE MARKS—HEAL MORE RAPIDLY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BRUISES
WHILE YOU'RE FEASTING ON PINEAPPLE AND CITRUS FRUIT, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT
ALSO TRY SOME OTHER TRADITIONAL HERBAL TREATMENTS THAT HAVE SCIENTIFIC MERIT.
98
BRUISES
X ARNICA (ARNICA MONTANA). THIS HERB, ALSO KNOWN AS MOUNTAIN DAISY,
IS HELPFUL IN TREATING BRUISES, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT
ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS.
ARNICA, WHICH HAS PAIN-RELIEVING, ANTISEPTIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, IS BEST RESERVED FOR USE ON THE SKIN. WHILE YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE IT INTERNALLY TO TREAT BRUISES, YOU CAN MAKE A HEALING SOLUTION USING ONE TEASPOON OF
DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP UNTIL COOL AND THEN APPLY WITH A
CLEAN CLOTH. OR MAKE THE SOLUTION USING TINCTURE OF ARNICA; A FEW DROPS PER CUP
OF WATER WILL DO IT. COMMERCIAL, MOSTLY HOMEOPATHIC ARNICA OINTMENTS ARE ALSO
AVAILABLE. LOOK FOR A PRODUCT CONTAINING UP TO 15 PERCENT ARNICA OIL AND FOLLOW
THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE), COMFREY IS AMONG THE OLDEST
HERBAL REMEDIES FOR SKIN PROBLEMS, DATING BACK TO ANCIENT GREECE. MODERN RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IT CONTAINS ALLANTOIN, A CHEMICAL THAT PROMOTES
SKIN REPAIR. ALLANTOIN IS AN INGREDIENT IN A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL SKIN CREAMS.
A REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BY COMMISSION E UNCOVERED EVIDENCE
THAT COMFREY IS ALSO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY. THAT'S WHY THE COMMISSION ENDORSED
APPLYING IT TO THE SKIN TO TREAT BRUISES, DISLOCATIONS AND SPRAINS.
TO TREAT BRUISES, MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST AND HERB EXPERT JOHN HEINERMAN
RECOMMENDS FIRST-AID APPLICATION OF ICE PACKS, THEN A BANDAGE SOAKED IN COMFREY TEA. QUICK ACTION CAN PREVENT SOME DISCOLORATION.
IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA NOT TO INGEST COMFREY, HOWEVER. IT CONTAINS
PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS, COMPOUNDS THAT ARE TOXIC TO THE LIVER, AND THERE IS SOME
CONTROVERSY ABOUT ITS SAFETY.
V GRAPE (VITIS VINIFERA). IN RECENT YEARS, A CHEMICAL FOUND IN GRAPE
SEEDS AND PINE BARK HAS BECOME A POPULAR, THOUGH EXPENSIVE, SUPPLEMENT. IT
IS SOLD UNDER THE BRAND NAME PYCNOGENOL. ACCORDING TO SOME NATUROPATHS,
PYCNOGENOL INCREASES LEVELS OF VITAMIN C IN THE BODY'S CELLS AND STRENGTHENS
THE CAPILLARIES AGAINST THE KIND OF TRAUMATIC INJURY THAT CAUSES BRUISES. I'M NOT
ENTIRELY SOLD ON PYCNOGENOL, BUT BY BLENDING GRAPE SEEDS INTO GRAPE JUICE, YOU
CAN GET SOME FOR FREE.
^ PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CRISPUM). REPEATED APPLICATIONS OF CRUSHED
PARSLEY LEAVES WILL USUALLY CLEAR UP ANY BLACK-AND-BLUE MARKS WITHIN A DAY OR SO.
I PLAN TO TRY PARSLEY THE NEXT TIME I GET A BRUISE.
V POTATO (SOLANUM TUBEROSUM). OLD-TIMERS CLAIM THAT RAW POTATO IS
BETTER THAN BEEFSTEAK FOR A BLACK EYE. ME, TOO. CHEAPSKATE SEMI-VEGETARIAN THAT I
AM, I WOULD SURELY APPLY A POTATO, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS
CHAPTER, BEFORE USING BEEFSTEAK.
99
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). THIS HERB HAS A REDDISH
OIL THAT MAY OOZE OUT WHEN THE PLANT IS HANDLED, MAKING IT SEEM TO BLEED.
ACCORDING TO TRADITION, IT CAME TO BE USED FOR SKIN CONDITIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE SKIN
ALSO BLEEDS. ALTHOUGH SUCH REASONS SEEM SILLY NOW, THERE HAS BEEN SOME
SCIENTIFIC VERIFICATION THAT THE HERB IS USEFUL FOR TREATING BRUISES, BURNS, CUTS AND
OTHER WOUNDS. COMMISSION E HAS ENDORSED IT FOR THESE USES. TRY STEEPING ONE TO
TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB IN VEGETABLE OIL FOR A FEW DAYS. THEN USE THE OIL TO
TREAT BRUISES.
V WITCH HAZEL (HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA). THE ASTRINGENCY OF THE LEAVES
AND BARK OF WITCH HAZEL MADE IT A POPULAR EARLY AMERICAN REMEDY FOR ALL SORTS OF
SKIN CONDITIONS, FROM BRUISES TO VARICOSE VEINS. WITCH HAZEL WATER IS AVAILABLE AT
PHARMACIES.
BUNIONS
B
ECAUSE I'M PARTIAL TO BEING BAREFOOT WHENEVER POSSIBLE, I'VE MANAGED
TO COMPLETELY SIDESTEP PAINFUL CONDITIONS LIKE CORNS AND BUNIONS THAT
SHOE-WEARERS OFTEN GET. IN FACT, FVE NEVER HAD ANY FOOT PROBLEMS EXCEPT THOSE
RELATED TO GOUT AND MINOR BOUTS WITH ATHLETE'S FOOT IN THE DISTANT PAST.
A BUNION IS A DEFORMITY OF THE BIG TOE. THE BASE OF THE TOE PROTRUDES OUTWARD, FORCING THE REST OF THE TOE TO POINT INWARD, SOMETIMES EVEN OVERLAPPING
THE OTHER TOES. THE BUNION IS THE BUMP AT THE BASE OF THE BIG TOE.
BUNIONS ARE SOMETIMES CAUSED BY A HEREDITARY WEAKNESS CALLED HALLUX
VALGUS. (HALLUX MEANS "BIG TOE," AND VALGUS MEANS "BOWED.") BUT MORE OFTEN,
ESPECIALLY IN WOMEN, THEY RESULT FROM TRYING TO FORCE THE FOOT INTO A POINTY-TOED,
HIGH-HEELED SHOE. THE BUNION RUBS ON SHOES, CAUSING A THICK CALLUS TO FORM.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BUNIONS
THE BEST ADVICE FOR BUNIONS IS TO WEAR SHOES WITH ROOMY TOE BOXES SO THAT THE
BUNION DOESN'T RUB. CUSHIONED SHOE PADS ALSO HELP. WHILE YOUR PODIATRIST MAY
RECOMMEND THESE REMEDIES AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER, HERBAL SOURCES
OF BUNION RELIEF. HERE ARE SOME OF THE HERBS THAT CAN HELP SOME PEOPLE.
W CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). MORE OFTEN USED FOR BRUISES, CUTS
AND INFLAMMATION, THIS HERB IS SOMETIMES RECOMMENDED FOR BUNIONS. YD TRY IT BY
APPLYING A COMMERCIAL CALENDULA SALVE OR TINCTURE DIRECDY TO THE BUNION, MAYBE
100
BUNION S
TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY FOR UP TO A WEEK. YOU'LL KNOW BY THEN IF IT'S GOING TO HELP.
VV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). NATUROPATHS SUGGEST TAKING BROMELAIN,
A PROTEIN-DISSOLVING (PROTEOLYTIC) ENZYME FOUND IN PINEAPPLE, FOR INFLAMMATORY
JOINT PROBLEMS SUCH AS BUNIONS. I GENERALLY PREFER A WHOLE-FOODS APPROACH, BUT IT
IS POSSIBLE TO BUY JUST THE BROMELAIN. NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHOR OF ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOLARLY BOOKS ON
NUTRITIONAL AND NATUROPATHIC HEALING, RECOMMENDS TAKING 250 TO 750 MILLIGRAMS
THREE TIMES A DAY. ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT BROMELAIN IS EXTREMELY SAFE. IN HUMAN
STUDIES, DOSES UP TO 2,000 MILLIGRAMS HAVE CAUSED NO SIDE EFFECTS.
YOU CAN TAKE COMMERCIAL BROMELAIN PRODUCTS IF YOU LIKE. I LOVE PINEAPPLE
AND WOULD RATHER GET MY BROMELAIN FROM THE NATURAL SOURCE. IF I HAD A BUNION,
I'D EAT LOTS OF PINEAPPLE IN FRUIT SALADS WITH PAPAYA, WHICH ALSO CONTAINS A POTENT PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME (PAPAIN), AND SEASON IT ALL LIBERALLY WITH GINGER, WHICH
CONTAINS BOTH PROTEOLYTIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS.
W RED PEPPE R (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). CAPSAICIN, THE HOT INGREDIENT IN RED PEPPER, IS ALSO MEDICALLY "HOT" AS A PAIN RELIEVER FOR INFLAMMATORY
CONDITIONS. WHEN APPLIED TO THE SKIN AT THE SITE OF PAIN, CAPSAICIN BLOCKS CERTAIN
PAIN NERVES BY DEPLETING THEM OF SUBSTANCE P, ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS RESPONSIBLE
FOR PRODUCING PAIN. MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT CREAMS CONTAINING 0.025 PERCENT CAPSAICIN RELIEVE ALL SORTS OF PAIN AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT.
IF I HAD A PAINFUL BUNION, I'D TRY THIS HERB. AT HOME, I'D BITE OFF ONE END OF A
HOT PEPPER AND CHEW IT, AND FD RUB THE OTHER END DIRECTLY ON THE BUNION. ON THE
ROAD, I'D GO WITH COMMERCIAL OVER-THE-COUNTER CAPSAICIN PREPARATIONS, SUCH AS
ZOSTRIX AND CAPZASIN-P.
IF YOU USE A CAPSAICIN CREAM, BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD SO THAT YOU DON'T GET IT IN YOUR EYES. ALSO, SINCE SOME PEOPLE ARE QUITE
SENSITIVE TO THIS COMPOUND, YOU SHOULD TEST IT ON A SMALL AREA OF SKIN BEFORE
USING IT ON A LARGER AREA. IF IT SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.
VV TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT LIKE RED PEPPER,
TURMERIC DEPLETES NERVE ENDINGS OF SUBSTANCE P. APPLYING ABOUT A TEASPOON OF
GRATED FRESH TURMERIC DIRECTLY TO THE BUNION TWICE A DAY COULD CONCEIVABLY BE
HELPFUL. OTHER STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN INGESTED, THE COMPOUND CURCUMIN IN
TURMERIC HAS POTENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS, ANOTHER REASON THAT IT MIGHT HELP
RELIEVE BUNION PAIN.
THE STANDARD DOSE OF CURCUMIN IS 400 MILLIGRAMS THREE TIMES A DAY, WHICH
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT SIX TO EIGHT TEASPOONS OF TURMERIC. THAT'S WAY MORE
TURMERIC THAN YOU'D WANT TO USE IN A CURRY. TO GET THIS HERB'S ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
BENEFITS, YOU'LL HAVE TO USE CAPSULES.
V \ WILLOW (SALIX) VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW IS HERBAL ASPIRIN, THANKS TO
101
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THE COMPOUND SALICIN THAT IT CONTAINS. A CLOSELY RELATED COMPOUND, SALICYLIC ACID,
IS APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AS A CALLUS REMOVER AND FOR WART
TREATMENT. SALICYLIC ACID ALSO SHOWS UP IN MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER PREPARATIONS FOR
TREATING BUNIONS AND CORNS. SALICYLATES ARE ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN. IF I HAD A
CALLUSED BUNION, YD TRY APPLYING FRESH WILLOW BY WRAPPING THE INNER BARK AROUND
THE BUNION. I'D ALSO ADD SOME DRIED BARK TO MY DAILY HERBAL TEAS. IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC
TO ASPIRIN, HOWEVER, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
V ARNICA (ARNICA MONTANA). THE FLOWERS OF THIS PLANT, ALSO KNOWN AS
MOUNTAIN DAISY, ARE USEFUL FOR TREATING MUSCLE AND JOINT COMPLAINTS, ACCORDING TO
COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT MAKES HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE
GERMAN GOVERNMENT. IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH EXTRAPOLATION TO SPECULATE THAT THIS HERB
MIGHT ALSO HELP DEAL WITH BUNIONS.
FOR A TEA, USE ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER
AND STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES. DON'T DRINK MORE THAN TWO CUPS A DAY FOR MORE THAN
THREE DAYS. FOR LONGER-TERM USE, I'D GO WITH AN ARNICA OINTMENT, WHICH IS WHAT
HOMEOPATHS RECOMMEND FOR ALL SORTS OF MUSCLE, JOINT AND SPORTS INJURIES. MANY
HEALTH FOOD STORES AND PHARMACIES NOW CARRY ARNICA OINTMENTS. FOLLOW THE
PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). ESSENTIAL OILS OF CAMOMILE, CYPRESS
AND JUNIPER HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY AROMATHERAPISTS FOR TREATING BURSITIS AND
COULD CONCEIVABLY BE USEFUL FOR BUNIONS. OF THE THREE, CAMOMILE WOULD BE MY TOP
CHOICE. IT HAS WELL-ESTABLISHED ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY THAT COULD HELP KEEP
BUNIONS UNDER CONTROL. AFTER YOU'VE DRUNK YOUR CAMOMILE TEA, APPLY THE SPENT TEA
BAG DIRECTLY TO THE BUNION.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION. IF
IT SEEMS TO HELP, GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE
ITCHING OR IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.
V CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM). CLOVE OIL IS ALMOST PURE EUGENOL, A
POTENT ANESTHETIC WIDELY USED BY DENTISTS FOR TREATING TOOTHACHE. IF I HAD A BUNION
AND CAPSAICIN WERE UNAVAILABLE OR INEFFECTIVE, I MIGHT TRY CLOVE OIL BY PLACING A
FEW DROPS ON A COTTON BANDAGE AND APPLYING IT DIRECTLY TO THE BUNION ONCE OR TWICE
A DAY. IF IT IRRITATES YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). IN ADDITION TO HAVING SOME PROTEOLYTIC
ACTIVITY, SPICY GINGER IS ALSO A PAIN-RELIEVING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT MIGHT HELP
CONTROL THE DISCOMFORT OF BUNIONS, ACCORDING TO INDIAN RESEARCHERS. THEY GAVE
THREE TO SEVEN GRAMS (1½ TO 3½ TEASPOONS) OF POWDERED GINGER A DAY TO 28 PEOPLE
WITH PAINFUL AND INFLAMED JOINTS. MORE THAN 75 PERCENT EXPERIENCED NOTICEABLE
102
BURN S
RELIEF FROM PAIN AND SWELLING. AFTER UP TO 30 MONTHS, NONE REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM THIS DOSAGE OF GINGER.
FOR BUNIONS, I'D SUGGEST DRINKING GINGER TEA MADE WITH ONE TEASPOON OF
GRATED FRESH GINGER PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. I WOULD DRINK THIS EVERY DAY AND
APPLY GRATED GINGER DIRECTLY TO THE BUNION ONCE OR TWICE A DAY AS WELL.
V SUNDEW (DROSERA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS HERB HAS A LONG FOLK REPUTATION AS A TREATMENT FOR BUNIONS, CORNS AND WARTS. ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO, SCIENTISTS
LEARNED WHY: IT HAS PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY. TO USE THIS HERB, CRUSH THE FRESH PLANT AND
APPLY IT DIRECDY TO THE BUNION ONCE OR TWICE A DAY FOR UP TO A WEEK. THE FRESH HERB
IS READILY AVAILABLE IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY: I KNOW PLACES IN PEAT BOGS
WHERE IT GROWS SO ABUNDANTLY THAT IT'S ALMOST A WEED. ELSEWHERE, HOWEVER, IT'S OFTEN LISTED AS A LOCALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES, SO YOU SHOULDN'T PICK IT UNLESS YOU'VE
GROWN IT ON YOUR OWN PROPERTY.
BURNS
MY WIFE IS NO REAL FAN OF HERBAL MEDICINE. SHE'D RATHER GO TO DOCTORS
AND TAKE PILLS THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE HERBAL CONCOCTIONS
AND HEALING VEGETABLE SOUPS THAT I MIX UP, MESSING UP HER KITCHEN. BUT LIKE
SO MANY HOMEMAKERS, MY HERBAILY SKEPTICAL PEGGY STILL HAS A SMALL POTTED ALOE
PLANT ON HER KITCHEN WINDOWSILL, AND SHE'S USED ITS GEL TO TREAT BURNS SEVERAL
TIMES OVER THE YEARS.
MY SECRETARY IS ALSO A FAN OF ALOE FOR BURNS. ONCE SHE FELL ASLEEP OUTDOORS
AND WOUND UP WITH A NASTY SUNBURN ON HER FEET AND ANKLES. SHE REACHED FOR
HER ALOE AND GOT EFFECTIVE RELIEF.
BURNS BY TKE NUMBERS
BURNS COME IN THREE DEGREES OF SEVERITY. FIRST-DEGREE BUMS INJURE ONLY THE
OUTERMOST LAYER OF SKIN. AN ORDINARY SUNBURN, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A FIRST-DEGREE BURN.
WHEN A BURN DEVELOPS BLISTERS, THE INJURY HAS PENETRATED DEEPER INTO THE
SKIN, AND YOU HAVE A VERY PAINFUL SECOND-DEGREE BURN.
THE WORST TYPE OF BURN, A THIRD-DEGREE BURN, IS, ODDLY, OFTEN NOT PAINFUL AT
ALL. THAT'S BECAUSE THE INJURY PENETRATES SO DEEPLY THAT IT DESTROYS THE NERVES
THAT TRANSMIT PAIN SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN.
THIRD-DEGREE BURNS ARE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES THAT ALWAYS REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL
103
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CARE AND TYPICALLY NECESSITATE HOSPITALIZATION. AND ANY SECOND-DEGREE BURN THAT
COVERS AN AREA OF SKIN LARGER THAN A QUARTER SHOULD RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BURNS
FOR FIRST-DEGREE AND SMALLER SECOND-DEGREE BURNS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
HERBAL TREATMENTS THAT CAN SOOTHE THE BURN AND HELP BRING RELIEF.
VVV ALOE (ALOE VERA). ALOE HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT BURNS AND OTHER WOUNDS
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. BUT IT'S NOT JUST A FOLK REMEDY. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT
THE GEL OBTAINED BY SLITTING OPEN THE SUCCULENT'S FAT, LEATHERY LEAVES RELIEVES BURNS,
INCLUDING BURNS CAUSED BY RADIATION TREATMENTS FOR CANCER.
MY FRIEND VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY
(NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, CITES
MANY STUDIES SHOWING THAT ALOE GEL IS USEFUL IN TREATING BURNS, WOUNDS AND FROSTBITE.
SCIENTISTS ARE STILL NOT CERTAIN HOW ALOE SPEEDS THE HEALING OF BURNS, BUT
THE HERB APPEARS TO HAVE SEVERAL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT ALOE
INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD FLOWING TO AREAS OF BURNED TISSUE, WHICH BRINGS
MORE OF THE BODY'S HEALING RESOURCES TO THE AREA
W WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED.
ALOE ALSO CONTAINS ENZYMES, CARBOXYPEPTIDASE AND BRADYKININASE, THAT RELIEVE
PAIN, REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND DECREASE
REDNESS AND SWELLING. IN ADDITION, ALOE
GEL HAS ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIFUNGAL
PROPERTIES, WHICH MIGHT HELP PREVENT
BURNS FROM GETTING INFECTED.
ALOE BELONGS IN EVERY KITCHEN, THE
PLACE WHERE MOST HOUSEHOLD BURNS
OCCUR. IT'S MY FIRST-CHOICE HERB FOR
BURNS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE FOOD AND
DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) DOES NOT
SHARE MY OPINION. TWO FDA ADVISORY
PANELS FOUND "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE"
THAT ALOE IS USEFUL FOR BURNS.
WHEN THE FDA SAYS "INSUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE," IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE EVIDENCE ISN'T OUT THERE—IT CLEARLY IS, AND
LOTS OF IT. IT MEANS ONLY THAT YEARS AGO,
WHEN THE PANELS WERE CONSIDERING OVERTHE-COUNTER DRUGS (AND WHEN U.S.
ALOE
ALOE, WHICH IS EASILY GROWN
INDOORS ON A WINDOWSILL,
HAS BEEN USED MEDICINALLY
SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES.
104
BURN S
HERBALISM WAS AT A LOW EBB), NO ONE SENT THE PANELS ENOUGH STUDIES TO CONVINCE
THEM. AND WHY SHOULD THEY? THE HERBAL BELIEVERS ARE ALREADY CONVINCED, AND
THERE'S NO ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR DRUG COMPANIES TO GET ALOE APPROVED WHEN ANYONE
CAN GROW IT AND THE COMPANIES CAN'T MAKE ANY MONEY ON IT.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). MOST PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH
HERBS KNOW THAT ECHINACEA (ALSO KNOWN AS CONEFLOWER) STIMULATES IMMUNE RESPONSES. BECAUSE IT DOES, IF I HAD A BUM, I'D TAKE OUT MY TINCTURE OF ECHINACEA
AND DRINK A TEASPOON OR TWO. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE
OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.) ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WITH
ANY KIND OF BUM IS INFECTION, AND A BEEFED-UP IMMUNE SYSTEM HELPS GUARD AGAINST
INFECTION. IN ADDITION, I'D APPLY A FEW DROPS DIRECTLY TO THE BUM. FEW PEOPLE
KNOW THAT ECHINACEA IS ALSO A GENTLE ANTISEPTIC THAT HELPS PREVENT INFECTION AT
THE BUM SITE.
V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A. CEPA). FROM AFRICA TO ROME
TO AMERICA, THESE HERBS OR THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES (CHIVES, LEEKS AND SCALLIONS) HAVE
BEEN APPLIED DIRECTLY TO BURNS. THESE PLANTS ALL HAVE UNDENIABLE ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES. TO USE ANY OF THESE PLANTS ON A BUM, JUST MASH THEM AND APPLY THE PASTE AS
A POULTICE.
V GOTU KOLA (CENTELLA A SIALIC A). NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS SUGGEST
TAKING THIS HERB (ALONG WITH FOODS HIGH IN VITAMIN C) FOR TREATMENT OF BUMS. THERE
IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE VITAMIN AND THREE COMPOUNDS IN
GOTU KOLA—ASIATIC ACID, ASIATICOSIDE AND MADECASSIC ACID—STIMULATE COLLAGEN
SYNTHESIS, A KEY ELEMENT IN SKIN REPAIR. (COLLAGEN IS A PROTEIN THAT FORMS THE BASIC
STRUCTURE OF SKIN.)
V LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). DURING THE 1920S, FRENCH
PERFUME CHEMIST REN6-MAURICE GATTEFOSSE" BURNED HIS HAND IN HIS LABORATORY. HE
PLUNGED IT INTO THE NEAREST LIQUID—A CONTAINER OF LAVENDER OIL. THE PAIN SUBSIDED
QUICKLY AND THE BURN HEALED WITH NO SCARRING. THIS INCIDENT MAY HAVE LED TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AROMATHERAPY, THE USE IN HEALING OF VARIOUS ESSENTIAL OILS TAKEN
FROM PLANTS.
OTHER ESSENTIAL OILS, SUCH AS CAMOMILE, CAMPHOR, EUCALYPTUS, GERANIUM,
ONION, PEPPERMINT, ROSEMARY AND SAGE, HAVE ALSO BEEN TOUTED AS BURN TREATMENTS. BUT AROMATHERAPISTS I KNOW RESERVE THEIR HIGHEST PRAISE FOR LAVENDER
OIL. CONSIDER PLACING A VIAL ON YOUR KITCHEN WINDOWSILL RIGHT NEXT TO THE ALOE
PLANT. (REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS, AS EVEN
A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.)
^ PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). PLANTAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR FOLK HERBAL REMEDIES FOR BURNS IN THE UNITED STATES. JUICE FROM THE FRESH
105
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
LEAVES OF THIS PLANT IS APPLIED DIRECTLY TO MILD BURNS. I'VE USED IT MANY TIMES AND
FOUND IT SOOTHING.
V ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM), GERMANY'S COMMISSION
E, THE SCIENTISTS WHO ADVISE THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBAL TREATMENTS,
PRAISED ST.-JOHN'S-WORT AS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EXTERNAL TREATMENT FOR FIRST-DEGREE
BURNS. ONE GERMAN STUDY SHOWED THAT ST.-JOHN'S-WORT SALVES SPEEDED UP BURN
HEALING TIME AND HELPED REDUCE SCARRING. YOU MAY NEED TO BEAT THE BUSHES TO FIND
A SALVE CONTAINING THIS HERB IN AMERICA, BUT TINCTURES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. YOU
CAN ALSO MAKE A SUITABLE PREPARATION BY STEEPING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED
HERB (PREFERABLY THE FLOWERING TOPS) IN A FEW OUNCES OF VEGETABLE OIL.
BURSITIS AND. TENDINITIS
A
FEW YEARS BACK, THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED A STORY ABOUT MY LIFELONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH MEDICINAL PLANTS. SOME TIME AFTER IT RAN, I GOT A
CALL FROM A TIMES EMPLOYEE WHO SAID THAT SOMETHING LIKE 20 PERCENT OF THE
NEWSPAPER'S EMPLOYEES WHO BANGED AWAY DAILY ON COMPUTER KEYBOARDS WERE
EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH INFLAMED JOINTS, INCLUDING TENDINITIS IN THEIR WRISTS
OR SHOULDERS OR BURSITIS OF THE SHOULDER.
HE SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING INTO ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENTS, CAME
ACROSS MY NAME IN THE TIMES ARCHIVES AND CALLED ME. I SENT HIM WHAT I HAD,
AND MY SYMPATHY AS WELL. I'VE HAD BURSITIS MYSELF AND CAN VOUCH FOR THE PAIN
AND DISABILITY IT CAUSES. LIKE THE MAN AT THE TIMES, I, TOO, SPEND HOURS ON END
WORKING AT A COMPUTER. I ALSO ENJOY PLAYING THE GUITAR AND BASS FIDDLE AND DO A
FAIR AMOUNT OF DRIVING AND LAWN MOWING, ALL OF WHICH CAN AGGRAVATE BURSITIS
AND TENDINITIS.
THESE TWO DISORDERS ARE OFTEN LUMPED TOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TWO
DISTINCT CONDITIONS. BURSITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE BURSAE, THE FLUID-FILLED
SACS THAT HELP LUBRICATE THE JOINTS IN PLACES WHERE MUSCLES AND TENDONS MEET
BONE. TENDINITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE TENDONS, THE TOUGH, ELASTIC, FIBROUS
TISSUES THAT CONNECT MUSCLES TO BONES.
THE TWO TERMS ARE OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY BECAUSE THE BURSAE ARE LOCATED NEAR TENDON-BONE CONNECTIONS, AND BOTH CONDITIONS CAUSE PAIN IN AND
AROUND THE JOINTS. BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS ALSO HAVE THE SAME CAUSE—OVERUSE OF
A PARTICULAR JOINT. THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS SHOW UP AS A RESULT OF SPORTS, AS IN
106
BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS
TENNIS ELBOW, AND IN JOBS THAT REQUIRE REPETITIVE MOVEMENT, SUCH AS CARPENTRY
AND BUTCHERING. WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM, THOUGH, BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS REALLY
HURT. AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THEY BOTH RESPOND TO THE SAME KINDS
OF TREATMENTS.
PHYSICIANS GENERALLY TREAT BURSITIS, TENDINITIS AND RELATED PROBLEMS WITH
REST AND MEDICATIONS THAT RELIEVE PAIN AND REDUCE INFLAMMATION—ASPIRIN AND
OTHER NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND CORTICOSTEROIDS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR BURSITIS ANA TENDINITIS
I THINK RESTING A JOINT THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY TENDINITIS OR BURSITIS IS A
GREAT IDEA. ICE PACKS MIGHT ALSO HELP CONTROL THE PAIN AND INFLAMMATION. BUT
DON'T COUNT ON AN ICE PACK TO PROVIDE COMPLETE RELIEF. AND WHILE TAKING ASPIRIN
AND RELATED DRUGS IS FINE, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES.
W%. WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER NATURAL PAIN RELIEVERS. WILLOW BARK IS HERBAL ASPIRIN. SO ARE MEADOWSWEET AND WINTERGREEN.
THEY ALL CONTAIN SALICYLATES, NATURAL PRECURSORS OF ASPIRIN. TO MAKE A TEA, I SUGGEST USING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF WATER AND BOILING IT FOR
ABOUT 20 MINUTES. HAVE A CUP TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY. OR TRY A TEASPOON OF TINCTURE OF ANY OF THESE HERBS THREE TIMES A DAY. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). GINGER HAS A LONG FOLK HISTORY IN ASIA
AS A BURSITIS TREATMENT. SINCE I LIKE GINGER, I SUGGEST TRYING IT IN COMBINATION WITH PINEAPPLE AND A LITTLE LICORICE (BOTH DISCUSSED BELOW) FOR RECURRING BURSITIS.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS HERB, ALSO CALLED
CONEFLOWER, IS GOOD FOR CONNECTIVE TISSUE INJURIES SUCH AS TENNIS ELBOW, SKIER'S
KNEE AND JOGGER'S ANKLE, ACCORDING TO MICHAEL MOORE, AUTHOR OF MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE DESERT AND CANYON WEST AND ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING HERBALISTS. ALL OTHESE INJURIES ARE, IN FACT, TYPES OF TENDINITIS. HE RECOMMENDS TAKING UP TO A HALFOUNCE OF ECHINACEA TINCTURE DAILY UNTIL THE SWELLING AND PAIN ARE REDUCED. THAT'S
A LOT OF TINCTURE, BUT ECHINACEA IS NOT HAZARDOUS (ALTHOUGH IT MAY CAUSE YOUR
TONGUE TO TINGLE OR BECOME NUMB), SO IT'S PROBABLY WORTH A TRY.
V HORSETAIL (EQUISETUM ARVENSE). THIS HERB IS ONE OF NATURE'S RICHEST
SOURCES OF THE ELEMENT SILICON, AND SOME SAY THAT IT IS IN A FORM THAT IS ESPECIALLY
EASY FOR YOUR BODY TO USE. A NUMBER OF STUDIES SHOW THAT SILICON PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE HEALTH AND RESILIENCE OF BOTH CARTILAGE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUES SUCH
AS TENDONS. (CARTILAGE FORMS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF JOINTS.)
I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M ENTIRELY SOLD ON HIGH-SILICON HERBS AND FOODS FOR
TREATING BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS, BUT TWO SCIENTISTS I RESPECT, HERBAL PHARMACOL107
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
OGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, AND FORREST NIELSEN, M.D., DIRECTOR OF THE
GRAND FORKS USDA HUMAN NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTER IN NORTH DAKOTA, TOUT
SILICON. SO I THINK IT'S WORTH TRYING, ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS HERB
WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE OF A HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER.
IF YOU'RE ADVISED TO TAKE THIS HERB, YOU CAN MAKE A TEA BY PUTTING FIVE TEASPOONS OF DRIED HORSETAIL, ONE TEASPOON OF SUGAR AND ONE QUART OF WATER IN A POT.
(THE SUGAR WILL PULL MORE SILICON OUT OF THE PLANT.) BRING IT TO A BOIL, THEN REDUCE THE HEAT AND LET IT SIMMER FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS. STRAIN THE TEA AND LET IT
COOL BEFORE DRINKING IT.
OTHER PLANTS HIGH IN SILICON INCLUDE BARLEY, CHICKWEED, CUCUMBERS,
PARSLEY, STINGING NETTLE, WALNUTS, BRAZIL NUTS, CASHEWS, PISTACHIOS, STRING BEANS
AND TURNIPS.
V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE CAN BE EVERY BIT AS EFFECTIVE
A TREATMENT FOR BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS AS THE COMMONLY PRESCRIBED DRUG HYDROCORTISONE, ACCORDING TO DR. MOWREY. PLUS, THE HERB HAS NONE OF THE USUAL SIDE
EFFECTS, SUCH AS WEIGHT GAIN, INDIGESTION, INSOMNIA AND LOWERED RESISTANCE TO INFECTION, THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CORTISONE AND HYDROCORTISONE. FROM WHAT I KNOW
OF LICORICE'S ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS, I BELIEVE THIS HERB IS WORTH TRYING. (WHILE
LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—UP TO ABOUT
THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY—LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.)
V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). THIS TASTY FRUIT CONTAINS ENZYMES THAT
BREAK DOWN PROTEIN. ONE OF THESE ENZYMES, BROMELAIN, IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IT HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES. PINEAPPLE REDUCES SWELLING, BRUISING
AND PAIN AND SPEEDS THE HEALING OF JOINT AND TENDON INJURIES.
MANY ATHLETES BELIEVE THAT PINEAPPLE HELPS HEAL SPRAINS AND TENDINITIS.
SOME EAT LOTS OF PINEAPPLE BEFORE AND AFTER STRENUOUS WORKOUTS TO HELP PROTECT
THEIR TENDONS, AS TENDINITIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THEM. DOES IT WORK? I DON'T
HAVE A DEFINITE ANSWER FOR THAT, BUT MY COLLEAGUE JAMES GORDON, M.D., PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR MIND-BODY MEDICINE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
TOLD ME THAT HE WAS AMAZED AT HOW PINEAPPLE ALLEVIATED HIS CHRONIC BACK CONDITION THAT INVOLVED PAIN AND INFLAMMATION.
THE BROMELAIN CONTENT OF PINEAPPLE IS NOT ALL THAT HIGH, BUT IF I HAD BURSITIS
OR TENDINITIS, I'D TRY THIS APPROACH. IT PROBABLY CAN'T HURT TO ADD FRESH PINEAPPLE
AND PINEAPPLE JUICE TO YOUR MENU WHILE YOU'RE GETTING OVER AN EPISODE OF TENDINITIS OR BURSITIS. PAPAYA CONTAINS ENZYMES SIMILAR TO THOSE IN PINEAPPLE, SO YOU
MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOME OF THIS FRESH FRUIT TO YOUR MENU AS WELL.
108
CANCER PREVENTION
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING
MAGNESIUM. MAGNESIUM IS AN IMPORTANT MINERAL FOR MUSCLES, BONES AND
CONNECTIVE TISSUES. AND SINCE LEAFY GREEN VEGETABLES ARE A GOOD SOURCE OF
MAGNESIUM, I'VE CREATED A MAGNESIUM MEDLEY SALAD. TO MAKE IT, INCLUDE ANY
OF THE FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS TO WHICH YOU HAVE ACCESS, IN WHATEVER AMOUNTS
ARE PLEASING TO YOU: FRESH PURSLANE, GREEN BEANS, SPINACH AND LETTUCE. AND
THROW SOME POPPY SEEDS INTO THE DRESSING; THEY ALSO CONTAIN MAGNESIUM.
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). THIS SILICON-RICH HERB HAS STRONG
FOLKLORIC SUPPORT AS A TREATMENT FOR GOUT AND RHEUMATISM, WHICH MEANS IT'S
LONG BEEN USED TO TREAT INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE JOINTS. SO IT
SEEMS PROMISING AS A TREATMENT FOR BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS AS WELL.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF
BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, AND NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHORS
OF A TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL MEDICINE, ARE JUST TWO OF THE HERBAL SCHOLARS WHO NOTTHAT CURCUMIN, A COMPOUND ABUNDANT IN TURMERIC, HAS PROVED AS EFFECTIVE AS
CORTISONE IN THE TREATMENT OF SOME KINDS OF INFLAMMATION. THEY SUGGEST TAKING
BOTH 250 TO 500 MILLIGRAMS OF CURCUMIN AND 250 MILLIGRAMS OF BROMELAIN THREE
TIMES A DAY, BETWEEN MEALS.
YOU CAN PURCHASE THESE ISOLATED COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL FOOD STORES, BUT I
HAVE A SUGGESTION THAT YOU MIGHT ENJOY MORE. TRY PREPARING RIPE PINEAPPLE, FOR
BROMELAIN, WITH TURMERIC, FOR A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF CURCUMIN. COME TO THINK OF IT,
A FRUIT COCKTAIL MADE OF PINEAPPLE AND PAPAYA SPICED WITH GINGER AND TURMERIC
WOULD TASTE PRETTY DARN GOOD.
I ALWAYS TAKE A WHOLE-FOODS APPROACH WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I THINK THAT
GENERALLY, WHOLE FOODS HAVE MORE HEALING POWER GOING FOR THEM THAN ANY
INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM THEM.
CANCER PREVENTION
I
T GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO BE ALIVE AND WELL IN MY LATE SIXTIES. I MUST
ADMIT THAT I HAD A HARD TIME DURING MY 65TH YEAR. YOU SEE, I WAS HAUNTED BY ONE DISTURBING HEALTH STATISTIC IN MY FAMILY. MY FATHER AND TWO OF HIS BROTHERS
ALL DIED AT AGE 65 OF COLON CANCER OR CANCER OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. NOW IT
SO HAPPENS THAT THEY ALSO RETIRED AT THAT AGE, SO I DECIDED THAT I WAS GOING TO TRY ANOTHER TACTIC. MAYBE IF I DIDN'T RETIRE, I WOULDN'T DIE, EITHER. SO I WORKED
10Q
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
ANOTHER YEAR AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) AND MADE IT TO 66
WITHOUT DEVELOPING COLON CANCER.
IN TRUTH, I THINK I DO KNOW WHY MY DAD AND UNCLES DEVELOPED THEIR CANCERS
AND I DID NOT. THEY ALL GREW UP AS GOOD OLD BOYS IN RURAL ALABAMA, EATING WHAT
REDNECKS USED TO EAT—A HIGH-FIBER, LOW-FAT COUNTRY DIET. BUT THEN THEY BECAME
SUCCESSFUL INSURANCE SALESMEN AND BEGAN EATING MORE MEAT AND POTATOES (MORE
MEAT THAN POTATOES).
I THINK THAT CHANGING THEIR DIET LIKE THAT KILLED THEM. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
IT WAS ESPECIALLY BAD THAT THEY ABANDONED THE CORNBREAD, PEAS, CABBAGE, GREEN
BEANS, LIMA BEANS AND COLLARD AND TURNIP GREENS OF THEIR YOUTH. REBELLIOUS SON
THAT I AM, I CUT WAY DOWN ON THE MEATS AND RETURNED TO ALL THE HIGH-FIBER, LOW-FAT
FOODS THAT MY DAD HAD STOPPED EATING. IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS A DIET RICH IN
CANCER-PREVENTING CHEMICALS FROM PLANTS (PHYTOCHEMICALS).
FOOD AS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
YOU'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING ME TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL HERBS IN
THIS CHAPTER, AS I DO IN ALL THE OTHER CHAPTERS, BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T DO THAT HERE.
ONE DEFINITION OF HERB—THE ONE I FAVOR—IS ANY PLANT THAT CAN BE USED AS A
HEALING AGENT. AS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALING POWER OF PLANTS CONTINUES TO
GROW, SO DOES THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT CAN BE CALLED HERBS. IF THESE DAYS THE
DEFINITION EMBRACES MANY OF OUR FOODS, SO BE IT.
WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTING CANCER, THE KEY SEEMS TO BE EATING AS WIDE A
VARIETY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS POSSIBLE. IN A SENSE, THEN, IF YOU WANT TO
LOWER YOUR RISK OF CANCER, YOU CAN CREATE A WHOLE DIET—EXCLUDING OR MINIMIZING MEATS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS—THAT CONSISTS OF HEALING HERBS. SO SINGLING
OUT INDIVIDUAL PLANTS WOULD BE GIVING YOU A FALSE PICTURE OF HOW TO USE HERBS
TO PREVENT CANCER.
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF THE HIGH-FIBER "FLAKES," BACK BEFORE NUTRITIONISTS
DISCOVERED THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THEY USED TO CALL ROUGHAGE. AS A MATTER OF
FACT, MY EVERYDAY DIET TURNED OUT TO BE HIGHER IN FIBER THAN THE HIGH-FIBER DIETS
THAT WERE FED TO THE VOLUNTEERS IN FIVE FORMAL USDA STUDIES. I KNOW, BECAUSE I
WAS ONE OF THE SUBJECTS IN THOSE STUDIES.
OF COURSE, I CAN'T PROVE THAT MY DAD'S HIGH-FAT DIET KILLED HIM, NOR THAT MY
PLANT-BASED DIET HAS SPARED ME FROM BECOMING A CANCER STATISTIC. BUT THE RESEARCH
IS VERY CLEAR. AS FAT AND MEAT CONSUMPTION INCREASES, CANCER RATES RISE. BUT AS
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION INCREASES, THEREBY LOWERING FAT IN THE DIET AND
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF FIBER AND HELPFUL PHYTOCHEMICALS, CANCER RATES FALL.

CANCER PREVENTION
FIGKTING TKE WRONG BATTLES
LIFESTYLE KEYS TO LOCKING
OWL
THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) HAS BEEN WAGING ITS WAR ON CANCER FOR
30 YEARS NOW. BUT IN EVERY YEAR REPORTED UP UNTIL 1996, CANCER DEATHS WERE INCREASING, ACCORDING TO NCI STATISTICS. SOME OF THE INCREASES HAVE TO DO WITH THE
FACT THAT FEWER PEOPLE ARE DYING OF HEART DISEASE AND STROKE, SO THEY LIVE LONG
ENOUGH TO GET CANCER. BUT CONSIDERING ALL THE MONEY AND ALL THE EFFORT
THIS COUNTRY HAS INVESTED IN BEATING
CANCER, WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO
SHOW FOR IT.
OVER THE YEARS, MANY NEW
CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, AND SOME WORK PRETTY WELL
TO EXTEND LIFE, ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T
CURE CANCER. AND SOME OF THE BEST OF
THOSE NEW CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS COME
FROM PLANTS: TAXOL, A TREATMENT FOR
OVARIAN AND BREAST CANCER, ORIGINALLY
FROM THE PACIFIC YEW TREE; ETOPOSIDE,
A TREATMENT FOR TESTICULAR CANCER AND
SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER, FROM THE
MAYAPPLE; AND VINBLASTINE AND VINCRISTINE, WHICH TREAT HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LEUKEMIAS AND LYMPHOMAS,
BOTH FROM THE MADAGASCAR PERIWINKLE.
BUT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG WITH THE
WAY THE NCI HAS APPROACHED CANCER.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF NCI RESEARCH
MONEY—OUR TAX DOLLARS—HAS GONE
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS, WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE
DEVOTED TO PREVENTION.
CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS HAVE THEIR
PLACE IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS,
BUT THEY'RE NOT CURES. THEY ARE USUALLY LIFE-EXTENDERS THAT ADD A FEW
CANCER PREVENTION INVOLVES MANY OF THE
SAME WISE MOVES INVOLVED IN PREVENTING
MANY OTHER DISEASES. YOU SHOULD MAKE THE
EFFORT TO GET:
• MORE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS, LESS FAT
AND RED MEAT.
• GREATER VARIETY IN YOUR DIET, LESS
MONOTONY.
• MORE CEREALS AND WHOLE GRAINS, LESS
PROCESSED SUGAR.
• MORE NATURAL FOOD COLORS, FEWER ARTIFICIAL COLORS.
• MORE HERBAL SPICES, FEWER ARTIFICIAL FLAVORINGS.
• MORE NATURAL, WHOLE FOODS, FEWER
PROCESSED FOODS.
• MORE ESTROGEN-LIKE CHEMICALS FROM
PLANTS (PHYTOESTROGENS), FEWER
SYNTHETIC HORMONES.
• MORE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES, FEWER
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.
• MORE FRESH AIR, LESS SMOKE- AND POLLUTION-FILLED AIR.
• MORE TRANQUILLITY, LESS STRESS.
• MORE EXERCISE, LESS TELEVISION.
• MORE PUBLIC GREENERY, LESS PAVEMENT.
• MORE ORGANIC GARDENS AND FARMS, FEWER
PESTICIDES.
• MORE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES, FEWER PHARMACEUTICAL "MAGIC BULLETS."

MONTHS OR YEARS TO AVERAGE SURVIVAL.
BUT THOSE MONTHS OR YEARS ARE OFTEN
LOWER-QUALITY TIME BECAUSE OF THE MANY
SIDE EFFECTS THAT CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS
CAUSE.
FROM 1977 TO 1982,1 WAS INVOLVED
WITH THE NCFS CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM, A MULTIYEAR EFFORT THAT INVESTIGATED THE CANCER TREATMENT POTENTIAL OF
THOUSANDS OF PLANT COMPOUNDS AND
GAVE US THE ONES MENTIONED ABOVE. I'VE
ALSO BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE EMBRYONIC
DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM OF THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), WHICH IS ATTEMPTING TO DESIGN FOODS HIGH IN
HEALTHFUL PHYTOCHEMICALS THAT PREVENT
CANCER.
I HAVE A GREATER RESPECT FOR THE POTENTIAL OF THE FOOD PROGRAM THAN I DO FOR
THE RESULTS OF THE DRUG-FINDING PROGRAM.
CLEARLY, CANCER PREVENTION PROGRAMS
^ ^ CAN SAVE MORE LIVES THAN TREATMENT PROGRAMS CAN, AND AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.
STILL THE 30-YEAR-OLD CURE-ORIENTED WAR ON CANCER GETS THE MOST TAX DOLLARS, WHILE
PREVENTION PROGRAMS GET VERY LITTLE.
ALMOST ALL OF MY DOCUMENTS ON CANCER HAVE TO DO WITH PREVENTION. YES, BY ALL
MEANS, LET US DEVELOP EFFECTIVE, GENDE TREATMENTS, BUT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT,
AND MORE COST-EFFECTIVE, TO WORK TO PREVENT THIS DISEASE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CANCER PREVENTION
TWENTY YEARS AGO, LONG BEFORE SCIENTISTS REACHED A CONSENSUS ON THE FACT
THAT A DIET HIGH IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES HELPS PREVENT CANCER, AND LONG BEFORE
THE NIH BEGAN URGING EVERYONE TO "STRIVE FOR FIVE"—FIVE SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND
VEGETABLES A DAY—PREVENTION MAGAZINE ASKED ME FOR IDEAS ON CANCER PREVENTION. I CAME UP WITH SEVERAL: A BIG GREEN SALAD OR COLESLAW (COLESLAW BEING A
REDNECK FAVORITE IN MY FAMILY), A BIG BOWL OF MINESTRONE SOUP AND A CANCER
PREVENTION HERBAL SALAD.
PM SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE A FINE GREEN SALAD, AND PLENTY OF GOOD SLAW
AND MINESTRONE RECIPES ARE AVAILABLE, SO I WON'T DWELL ON THEM HERE EXCEPT TO
SFRIVE-FOR-HVEODE
I RECENTLY CONCOCTED A MOST ATTRACTIVE
FIVEADE. FIRST I DICED ONE APPLE, TWO CARROTS AND SECTIONS OF ONE LIME AND ONE PINK
GRAPEFRUIT. THEN I TOSSED THEM IN THE
BLENDER AND JUST COVERED THEM WITH WATER.
THE RESULTING BEVERAGE WAS THE COLOR OF ORANGE SHERBET, JUST LIKE THE ARTIFICIAL ORANGE
SHERBET MY DAD USED TO BUY ME IN DURHAM.
BY DRINKING THE FIVEADE FOR BREAKFAST,
I DID ALL OF MY STRIVING FOR FIVE BEFORE LUNCH.
THEN I MADE ANOTHER BATCH AND DIVIDED IT:
I FROZE SOME LIKE SHERBERT AND SOME AS ICE
POPS WITH STICKS. I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT ON MY
GRANDKIDS. THEY WOULD WANT IT SWEETER, I'M
SURE, BUT I COULD FOOL THEM WITH STEVIA, AN
HERB THAT'S A GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR SUGAR AND
ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER. IT'S AVAILABLE IN HERB
SHOPS; YOU CAN OPEN A TEA BAG AND ADD A
PINCH TO BEVERAGES.
112
CANCER PREVENTIO N
SAY THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE TOO MANY DIFFERENT VEGETABLES. TRY TO INCLUDE AS
GREAT A VARIETY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN THESE DISHES—AND IN YOUR DIET—AS
YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
MY HERBAL SALAD RECIPE IS A LITTLE MORE OBSCURE, SO I'LL DISCUSS IT MORE
FULLY.
V W CANCER PREVENTION HERBAL SALAD. AT THE CORE OF THE RECIPE ARE SEVERAL PLANTS I LIFTED (WITH THANKS) FROM JONATHAN HARTWELL'S ETHNOBOTANICAL
CLASSIC PLANTS USED AGAINST CANCER, A COMPENDIUM OF ABOUT 3,000 PLANTS CITED
IN THE MEDICAL-FOLKLORIC LITERATURE FOR TREATING CANCER. MORE THAN HALF OF
HARTWELL'S PLANTS TURNED OUT TO CONTAIN A COMPOUND USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF
SOME TYPES OF CANCERS, AT LEAST IN THE TEST TUBE.
MY CANCER PREVENTION HERBAL SALAD NOW INCLUDES GARLIC, ONIONS, RED PEPPERS, TOMATOES, RED CLOVER FLOWERS, CHOPPED COOKED BEETS, FRESH CALENDULA
FLOWERS, CELERY, FRESH CHICORY FLOWERS, CHIVES, CUCUMBERS, CUMIN, PEANUTS,
POKESALAD, PURSLANE AND SAGE.
IN ADDITION, I CAME UP WITH A CANCER PREVENTION DRESSING TO USE WITH THIS
SALAD. IT INCLUDES FLAXSEED OIL, EVENING PRIMROSE OIL, GARLIC, ROSEMARY, A DASH
OF LEMON JUICE AND THAT LATIN AMERICAN FAVORITE, HOT PEPPERS.
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER I DEVELOPED MY SALAD, LATE IN 1989, HERBERT PIERSON,
PH.D., OF THE NIH CALLED TO INVITE MY PARTICIPATION IN THE DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM FOR CANCER PREVENTION. THIS WAS A MAJOR NATIONAL EFFORT TO MANIPULATE
FOODS TO INCREASE THEIR CONTENT OF NUTRACEUTICALS (NUTRIENTS WITH MEDICINAL
VALUE). THE IDEA WAS TO ENHANCE THE AMOUNT OF CANCER-FIGHTING CHEMICALS IN
FOODS, EITHER BY MANIPULATING THE PLANTS' GENES OR BY COMING UP WITH NECESSARY TECHNIQUES THAT WOULD PRESERVE OR ENHANCE THE DESIRED MEDICINAL EFFECTS.
DR. PIERSON WAS MOST INTERESTED IN MY DATABASE OF MEDICINAL PHYTOCHEMICALS IN FOOD PLANTS AND HERBS, WHICH INCLUDES ANTI-CANCER COMPOUNDS—THE
SAME EVER-EVOLVING DATABASE ON WHICH THIS BOOK IS BASED. HE INVITED ME TO ATTEND A MEETING WHERE EXPERTS WOULD EXPLAIN THE CANCER-PREVENTION BENEFITS OF
VARIOUS PLANTS.
IMAGINE MY DELIGHT WHEN MY COLLEAGUES AND FELLOW RESEARCHERS SPOKE
ABOUT THE ANTI-CANCER PHYTOCHEMICALS THAT THEY WERE FINDING IN PLANTS. MY
FELLOW SCIENTISTS GAVE PRESENTATIONS ON THE SULFIDES IN GARLIC, THE CAPSAICIN IN
RED PEPPERS, THE LIMONENE IN CITRUS FRUITS AND THE LYCOPENE IN TOMATOES. THEY
TOUTED THE CANCER-FIGHTING POTENTIAL OF SUCH HERBS AS FLAX, LICORICE AND ROSEMARY. (EVER SINCE THAT CONFERENCE, I'VE BEEN ADDING ROSEMARY TO MY SALAD
DRESSING.)
THE DESIGNER FOOD PROGRAM CLEARLY HAD A LOT GOING FOR IT. I GOT EXCITED
ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND EAGERLY ANTICIPATED FIVE YEARS OF HELPING THE NIH IN THIS
113
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
AREA. BUT ALAS, DR. PIERSON LEFT THE NIH, AND THE PROGRAM NOW SEEMS MUCH LESS
VISIBLE AND EXCITING.
FORTUNATELY, RESEARCH ON THE MEDICINAL POTENTIAL OF FOODS IS GOING FORWARD
IN OTHER PROGRAMS AND INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, YOU'LL BE HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT NUTRACEUTICALS, PHYTOCHEMICALS
AND MEALS THAT HEAL. FOODS AND TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL HERBS CLEARLY HAVE
HEALING PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO PREVENT CANCER.
CANKER SORES
E
ARLY AMERICAN SETTLERS INTRODUCED MYRRH TO THE NEW WORLD. ALTHOUGH
MOST OF US ASSOCIATE MYRRH WITH THE CHRISTMAS TALE OF THE THREE WISE
MEN'S GIFTS TO THE BABY JESUS, THESE EARLY SETTLERS WEREN'T CARRYING MYRRH FOR
RELIGIOUS PURPOSES. THEY USED IT AS A TREATMENT FOR CANKER SORES AND OTHER
KINDS OF MOUTH SORES, ACCORDING TO WALTER LEWIS, PH.D., AND MEMORY ELVINLEWIS, PH.D., BOTH PROFESSORS AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS AND CO-AUTHORS OF THE CLASSIC BOOK, MEDICAL BOTANY.
CANKER SORES ARE PAINFUL, CRATERLIKE ULCERS THAT FORM IN THE MOUTH OR ON
THE INNER LIPS. ALSO KNOWN AS APHTHOUS ULCERS, CANKER SORES USUALLY CLEAR UP BY
THEMSELVES WITHIN A WEEK OR SO, BUT THEY OFTEN RECUR, SOMETIMES IN THE FORM OF
MULTIPLE SORES. ESTIMATES VARY, BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 AND 50 PERCENT OF
AMERICANS KNOW THE PAIN OF CANKER SORES.
FOLK TREATMENTS: THE WAY TO GO
DOCTORS DON'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER PEOPLE WITH CANKER SORES. THEY OFTEN PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS OR CORTICOSTEROIDS, MEDICATIONS THAT HELP RELIEVE PAIN AND INFLAMMATION. BUT NEITHER OF THESE TREATMENTS HELPS MUCH. SO EVEN DOCTORS TEND TO RECOMMEND TRADITIONAL RELIEF—ICE TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND RINSING THE
MOUTH WITH WARM SALTWATER SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
DOCTORS ALSO SUGGEST ELIMINATING THINGS THAT SOMETIMES TRIGGER OR AGGRAVATE CANKER SORES, SUCH AS ALCOHOL, CHEWING GUM, CITRUS FRUITS, COFFEE, DAIRY
PRODUCTS, MEAT, PINEAPPLE, SPICY FOODS, TOMATOES, TOOTHPASTE AND VINEGAR AND
OTHER ACIDIC FOODS. (IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHICH FOODS ARE ACIDIC, JUST PUT ANYTHING
THAT TASTES SOUR ON THE LIST.)
114
CANKER SORE S
DOCTORS ALSO SUGGEST AVOIDING ANYTHING THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE ALLERGIC TO.
PEOPLE OFTEN INDULGE IN "JUST A TASTE" OF SOMETHING TO WHICH THEY KNOW THEY
HAVE A MILD ALLERGY, BUT NIBBLING THESE "FORBIDDEN" FOODS IS A NOTORIOUS CAUSE
OF CANKER SORES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CANKER SORES
I'M ALL FOR USING ICE AND RINSING YOUR MOUTH WITH SALTWATER. AND I THINK IT'S
A GREAT IDEA—AS WELL AS OBVIOUS—TO AVOID POSSIBLE CANKER SORE TRIGGERS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. I MYSELF WOULD ALSO TRY THESE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES.
W MYRRH {COMMIPHORA, VARIOUS SPECIES). MYRRH IS MORE THAN JUST A
FOLK REMEDY FOR CANKER SORES. GERMANY'S COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF SCIENTISTS THAT
PROVIDES ADVICE ON HERBAL MATTERS, HAS ENDORSED POWDERED MYRRH FOR THE TREATMENT OF MILD INFLAMMATIONS OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS HIGH
AMOUNTS OF TANNINS.
TANNIN, THE COMMON NAME FOR TANNIC ACID, IS A CONSTITUENT OF MANY PLANTS
AND GIVES FOODS AN ASTRINGENT TASTE. AN ANTISEPTIC WITH BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIVIRAL ACTION, IT'S ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR TREATING MOUTH SORES,
WHICH COULD BE CAUSED BY A BACTERIUM, A FUNGUS, A VIRUS OR AN ALLERGY.
TO USE POWDERED MYRRH, JUST OPEN A CAPSULE (AVAILABLE AT HEALTH FOOD
STORES) AND DAB A LITTLE DIRECTLY ON THE SORE.
VV TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). MYRRH ISN'T THE ONLY HERB THAT'S HIGH IN
TANNIN: REGULAR BEVERAGE TEA ALSO HAS A RICH SUPPLY. TRY PLACING A SPENT TEA BAG ON
YOUR CANKER SORES. OR MAKE TEA FROM SOME OF THE OTHER HERBS THAT ARE HIGH IN
TANNIN, SUCH AS BEARBERRY, EUCALYPTUS, ST.-JOHN'S-WORT, SAGE, RASPBERRY, PEPPERMINT AND LICORICE.
V CANKERROOT (COPTIS GROENLANDICA). THIS PLANT GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE
OF ITS TRADITIONAL USE AS A TREATMENT FOR CANKER SORES. AMERICAN INDIANS AND EARLY
SETTLERS ALIKE USED CANKERROOT AS A TEA TO TREAT BOTH SORE THROAT AND CANKER SORES.
PENOBSCOT INDIANS CHEWED RAW ROOT FOR CANKER SORES AND FEVER BLISTERS.
THE PLANT, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS GOLDTHREAD, SHARES MANY OF THE ACTIVE
INGREDIENTS AND HEALING PROPERTIES OF THE MORE FAMILIAR GOLDENSEAL, BARBERRY
AND OREGON GRAPE.
V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). THIS HERB WAS AN AMERICAN INDIAN FAVORITE FOR TREATING ALL SORTS OF WOUNDS. WHEN SCIENTISTS LOOKED AT THIS HERB,
THEY FOUND THAT THE INDIANS WERE ON TO SOMETHING. IT TURNS OUT THAT GOLDENSEAL CONTAINS ASTRINGENT, ANTISEPTIC CHEMICALS THAT HELP TREAT WOUNDS AND INFECTIONS.
TO MAKE A CANKER SORE MOUTHWASH, USE TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED GOLDENSEAL
PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEP UNTIL COOL. USE IT AS A MOUTH RINSE THREE OR
115
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
FOUR TIMES A DAY. BARBERRY AND OREGON GRAPE HAVE SIMILAR CONSTITUENTS AND
HEALING EFFECTS.
V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIAA GLABRA). IN ONE STUDY THAT LOOKED AT THE POWER
OF LICORICE TO HEAL CANKER SORES, A MOUTHWASH CONTAINING THIS HERB PROVIDED RELIEF
FOR 75 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO USED IT. THOSE WHO GOT RELIEF NOTED SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT WITHIN ONE DAY AND COMPLETE HEALING BY THE THIRD DAY. THIS STUDY
WAS CITED BY MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, IN HIS INSIGHTFUL
BOOK NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS.
IN ADDITION TO TANNIN, LICORICE HAS TWO OTHER THINGS GOING FOR IT: THE COMPOUNDS GLYCYRRHETINIC-ACID AND GLYCYRRHIZIN, BOTH OF WHICH HELP SPEED THE
HEALING OF SORES. YOU MIGHT SWEETEN THE TEAS RECOMMENDED HERE WITH LICORICE.
V SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AMONG THE RICHEST
SOURCES OF TANNIN, MANY HERBALISTS SUGGEST MAKING A STRONG SAGE TEA TO TREAT INFLAMMATIONS OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. TO MAKE THIS TEA, USE TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED
HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. LET IT STEEP UNTIL COOL AND THEN GARGLE WITH IT.
YOU SHOULD NOT DRINK TOO MUCH OF THIS TEA. SAGE CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF
THUJONE, A COMPOUND THAT IN VERY HIGH DOSES MAY CAUSE CONVULSIONS. ALTHOUGH
SAGE IS AN EXCELLENT HEALING HERB, AND WEAK SAGE TEA PREPARATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK, SAGE IS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS—LIKE ASPIRIN—THAT IS GOOD IN SMALL AMOUNTS AND NOT SO GOOD IN LARGE AMOUNTS.
V WILD GERANIUM (GERANIUM MACULATUM). THE ROOT OF THIS COMMON
PLANT WAS WELL-USED MEDICINALLY BY AMERICAN INDIANS AND EARLY SETUERS. THE
CHEROKEE, FOR EXAMPLE, USED IT AS AN ASTRINGENT TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF OPEN
WOUNDS AND AS A WASH TO TREAT CANKER SORES. GIVEN ITS WIDE FOLK USE TO TREAT MOUTH
SORES, I THINK THIS HIGH-TANNIN HERB IS WORTH TRYING.
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA
A
VERY FRIGHTENED FATHER CALLED ME ASKING FOR HELP. HIS SIX-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUSLY IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
(CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA).
ARRHYTHMIAS ARE MUCH WORSE THAN THE MORE COMMON HEART PALPITATIONS, A
CONDITION IN WHICH THE HEART OCCASIONALLY SEEMS TO SKIP A BEAT OR TWO. HEART
PALPITATIONS ARE OFTEN MINOR AND SELF-CORRECTING. CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS ARE NOT.
116
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMI A
THEY OFTEN DON'T NORMALIZE BY THEMSELVES, AND THEY CAN LEAD TO A POTENTIALLY
FATAL HEART ATTACK. ARRHYTHMIAS ARE USUALLY DIAGNOSED IN PEOPLE OVER 50, BUT
HERE WAS A FATHER TELLING ME THAT HIS LITTLE GIRL HAD THIS PROBLEM.
HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD BEEN TAKING A CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER,
A STANDARD TYPE OF HEART MEDICATION, BUT THAT IT HADN'T HELPED. "OH, NO," I
THOUGHT. "NOW YOU WANT TO SWITCH TO AN HERBAL MEDICINE, AND YOU WANT ME TO
TELL YOU WHICH ONE AND HOW MUCH TO TAKE."
SO I TOOK A BREATH AND WAS ABOUT TO DELIVER MY USUAL SPIEL: "I DON'T PRESCRIBE, ESPECIALLY FOR SOMETHING AS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS AS CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA.
SEE YOUR DOCTOR." ^
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT WHEN THE
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER DIDN'T DO
THE TRICK, THE DAUGHTER'S DOCTOR, OF ALL
PEOPLE, HAD SUGGESTED ADDING A FEW
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES TO HER TREATMENT
REGIMEN: HAWTHORN, COENZYME Q10
AND MAGNESIUM.
THE NATURAL ROUTE
THE HERB HAWTHORN IS A TRADITIONAL HEART TONIC. AND COENZYME QM
AND MAGNESIUM HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN
SEVERAL STUDIES TO HELP THE HEART. THE
FATHER FOLLOWED THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE,
AND HE SAID THAT THE NATURAL APPROACH WAS WORKING BETTER THAN THE
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER HAD. BUT
NOW THAT THE DAUGHTER WAS TAKING
HAWTHORN REGULARLY, THE FATHER WAS
NATURALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL LONG-TERM TOXICITY.
I WENT TO MY DATABASE AND REFERENCE BOOKS AND FAXED HIM WHAT I COULD FIND.
HAWTHORN APPEARED TO BE SAFE FOR LONG-TERM USE, BUT I LEARNED THAT MOST PEOPLE
WHO USE IT FOR HEART PROBLEMS (PRIMARILY EUROPEANS) ARE OLDER ADULTS, NOT CHILDREN. CURIOUSLY, NONE OF MY SOURCES AT HAND SAID THAT HAWTHORN HELPED TREAT ARRHYTHMIAS. IN FACT, ONE SOURCE SAID IT MIGHT CAUSE THEM. BUT I FOUND NO CASE
REPORTS OF HEART ATTACKS RESULTING FROM USING THIS HERB, SO I TOLD THE WORRIED FATHER THAT I'D RATHER GIVE MY DAUGHTER HAWTHORN THAN A CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER.
IMPROVIN G N W DN T
IN ADDITION TO HERBS, A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT ARRHYTHMIA. HERE
ARE THE BASICS.
• EAT A LOW-FAT DIET.
• EXERCISE REGULARLY.
• DON'T SMOKE.
• MANAGE YOUR STRESS.
• MANAGE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME MEDICAL
REASON TO AVOID ALCOHOL, BY ALL MEANS
HAVE ONE OR TWO DRINKS A DAY. SOME 30
STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THIS LEVEL OF ALCOHOL
CONSUMPTION REDUCES HEART ATTACK RISK BY
25 TO 40 PERCENT. BUT DON'T EXCEED THAT
TWO-DRINK LIMIT: HEAVIER DRINKING MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE.
117
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE GIRL'S FATHER CALLED AGAIN, ELATED, TO SHARE HIS GOOD
NEWS. JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS, HIS DAUGHTER WAS OFF THE CALCIUM CHANNEL
BLOCKER COMPLETELY, THANKS TO THE HAWTHORN, COENZYME Q10 AND MAGNESIUM. AT
HER LAST CHECKUP, HER DOCTOR DETECTED NO ARRHYTHMIA AT ALL. I SUGGESTED THAT HE
PLANT A HAWTHORN TREE IN HIS YARD TO SHOW TO PEOPLE WHEN HE RECOUNTS HIS STORY.
PROBLEMS WITH RNYTNIN
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA SIMPLY MEANS THAT THE HEART RHYTHM IS IRREGULAR, EITHER
TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW. WHEN YOUR HEART BEATS TOO FAST—MORE THAN 100 BEATS PER
MINUTE—THE CONDITION IS KNOWN AS TACHYCARDIA. WHEN IT BEATS TOO SLOWLY—
FEWER THAN 60 BEATS PER MINUTE—YOU HAVE BRADYCARDIA.
ARRHYTHMIAS ARE ALSO NAMED ACCORDING TO THE PART OF THE HEART THAT IS AFFECTED. ATRIAL ARRHYTHMIAS DISTURB THE HEART'S ABILITY TO PUMP THE BLOOD FROM
ITS UPPER CHAMBERS, WHICH RESULTS IN THE "POOLING" OF BLOOD. THIS STAGNANT
BLOOD CAN FORM CLOTS AND TRIGGER HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS, WHICH AFFECT THE HEART'S LARGER, LOWER CHAMBERS, CAN LEAD TO A CONDITION
CALLED VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION, A CONDITION IN WHICH THE CHAMBERS QUIVER
WEAKLY INSTEAD OF CONTRACTING VIGOROUSLY. VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION IS THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF HEART ATTACK DEATHS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA IS A SERIOUS CONDITION THAT SHOULD BE TREATED BY A
PHYSICIAN. IF I HAD IT, I WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE THE MEDICATIONS MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED. BUT IN CONSULTATION WITH MY PHYSICIAN—AND MANY ARE INCREASINGLY
OPEN TO HERBAL REMEDIES—I MIGHT ALSO TRY SOME MEDICINAL HERBS.
V W ANGELICA {ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA). THIS HERB CONTAINS AT LEAST 14
ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC COMPOUNDS, ONE OF WHICH IS SAID TO BE AS ACTIVE AS VERAPAMIL
(CALAN, ISOPTIN), A POPULAR CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER. I SUGGEST TAKING ANGELICA IN
THE FORM OF MY ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC ANGELADE. TO MAKE THIS TASTY COCKTAIL, PUT ANGELICA, CARROTS, CELERY, FENNEL, GARLIC AND PARSNIPS THROUGH YOUR JUICER. YOU MAY
HAVE TO ADD SOME WATER AND SPICES TO MAKE IT DRINKABLE. HEAVY WITH CARROTS AND
GARLIC, IT CAN BE QUITE TASTY. I SUGGEST DRINKING ONE OR TWO EIGHT-OUNCE GLASSES.
CELERY CONTAINS CALCIUM BLOCKERS AND OTHER PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS) SUCH AS APIGENIN, APIIN, MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THAT HELP PREVENT AND
TREAT ARRHYTHMIAS, PLUS OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT HELP LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND
CHOLESTEROL. GARLIC ALSO APPEARS TO BE A POTENT ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC AGENT. IN
STUDIES, LABORATORY ANIMALS THAT ATE GARLIC POWDER SHOWED LESS VENTRICULAR
TACHYCARDIA AND FIBRILLATION.
118
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA
^ W CINCHONA (CINCHONA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS IS THE SOURCE OF QUININE,
WHICH IS FAMOUS AS A TREATMENT FOR MALARIA. QUININE STARTED TO GAIN ATTENTION AS A
REMEDY FOR HEART PROBLEMS ABOUT A CENTURY AGO. LEGEND HAS IT THAT A DUTCH MERCHANT WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION CONSULTED SEVERAL DOCTORS, WHO TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO
REMEDY. HE SOUGHT HIS OWN REMEDY AND TOOK A GRAM OF QUININE. WHEN HE RETURNED
TO HIS DOCTORS THE NEXT DAY, SO THE STORY GOES, HIS PULSE WAS REGULAR.
THE KEY COMPOUND IS QUINIDINE, NOW A STANDARD ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC MEDICATION. QUINIDINE IS NOT THE ONLY HELPFUL COMPOUND IN THE HERB, HOWEVER, THERE
ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN. SINCE YOU GET A FEW OF THESE COMPOUNDS WHEN YOU DRINK
TONIC WATER, I'D DRINK PLENTY OF TONIC IF I HAD ARRHYTHMIA.
VVV HAWTHORN (CRATAEGUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). HAWTHORN IS A CENTURIESOLD HEART TONIC, AND MODERN RESEARCH HAS CONFIRMED ITS TRADITIONAL USE. MANY
STUDIES SHOW THAT IT HELPS PREVENT HEART PROBLEMS, GENTLY STRENGTHENING THE HEART
MUSCLE, IMPROVING BLOOD CIRCULATION THROUGH THE HEART AND REDUCING THE HEART'S
NEED FOR OXYGEN. IT ALSO HELPS THE HEART CIRCULATE BLOOD WITH LESS EFFORT.
NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS RECOMMEND TAKING STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS. THE
KIND OF EXTRACTS IS IMPORTANT, AND I'M GOING TO INCLUDE THESE DETAILS SO THAT YOU
CAN DISCUSS THEM WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING THE RIGHT
HERBAL MEDICATION IF YOUR DOCTOR GIVES YOU THE GO-AHEAD TO TRY THIS. (NOTICE THAT
NATUROPATHS DO NOT RECOMMEND USING RAW HAWTHORN. ALSO NOTE THAT MANY STATES
DO NOT REQUIRE NATUROPATHS TO BE LICENSED. IF YOU HAVE ANY HINT OF A HEART CONDITION, YOU MUST LOOK INTO YOUR NATUROPATH'S CREDENTIALS AND TRAINING. IF YOU'RE
NOT SURE WHETHER TO PROCEED, DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR REGULAR PHYSICIAN.)
THE RECOMMENDED EXTRACTS CONTAIN 1.8 PERCENT VITEXIN-4-RHAMNOSIDE OR
10 PERCENT OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS) IN DOSAGES OF 120 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS THREE TIMES A DAY. IF THE EXTRACTS ARE STANDARDIZED TO 18 PERCENT OPCS,
THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE IS 240 TO 480 MILLIGRAMS ONCE A DAY. TO OBTAIN THESE
EXTRACTS, YOU MUST CONSULT A NATUROPATH.
THERE HAVE BEEN SCATTERED REPORTS THAT HAWTHORN MAY INCREASE ARRHYTHMIAS
IN SOME CASES. I DON'T PUT MUCH STOCK IN THESE REPORTS, BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE SAFE
THAN SORRY. YOU REALLY NEED TO BE MONITORED BY A DOCTOR IF YOU TRY THIS HERB.
VV CANOLA (BRASSICA, VARIOUS SPECIES). AUSTRALIAN CARDIOLOGISTS HAVE
SHOWN THAT DIETARY CANOLA OIL HELPS PREVENT CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS IN LABORATORY ANIMALS. I BET THAT IT WOULD ALSO HELP IN PEOPLE.
VV KHELLA (ANUNI MA JUS). KHELLA IS THE SOURCE OF AMIODARONE (CORDARONE),
ONE OF THE KEY ANTI-ARRHYTHMIA MEDICATIONS. LONDON CARDIOLOGIST ARTHUR HOLLMAN,
M.D., TELLS THE STORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS DRUG IN HIS BOOK CARDIOLOGY FROM
NATURE, WHICH IS A TRIBUTE TO THE POWERS OF NATURAL MEDICINE.
BACK IN 1946, A TECHNICIAN IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH LABORATORY OF G. V. AN119
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
REPIN, M.D., DEVELOPED A KIDNEY PROBLEM AND TREATED HIMSELF WITH A MIDDLE
EASTERN HERBAL REMEDY, KHELLA.
AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT, THE TECHNICIAN ALSO HAD ANGINA, WHICH IMPROVED
DRAMATICALLY WHILE HE WAS TAKING THE HERB. INTRIGUED BY THIS UNEXPECTED BENEFIT, DR. ANREPIN STUDIED THE PLANT AND ISOLATED ITS ACTIVE INGREDIENT, KHELLIN.
FURTHER WORK ELSEWHERE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF KHELLIN-DERIVED AMIODARONE,
WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY USED TO TREAT ANGINA. EVENTUALLY, IN 1974, ITS UNIQUE ANTIARRHYTHMIC ACTIVITY WAS DISCOVERED.
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET SOME BENEFIT FROM TAKING THE HERB ITSELF TO TREAT ARRHYTHMIA. THE USUAL RECOMMENDATION CALLS FOR POURING BOILING WATER OVER ABOUT
A QUARTER-TEASPOON OF POWDERED KHELLA FRUITS. STEEP FOR FIVE MINUTES AND DRINK
THE TEA AFTER STRAINING.
V ASTRAGALUS (ASTRAGALUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS HUANG QI,
ASTRAGALUS IS BEST KNOWN AS AN IMMUNE STIMULANT. ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA
HERBALIST KATHI KEVILLE, AUTHOR OF THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR
HEALTH AND HEALING, IT IS ALSO A HEART TONIC THAT HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT ARRHYTHMIA. YOU CAN TRY A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB STEEPED
IN BOILING WATER.
V BARBERRY {BERBERIS VULGARIS). BARBERRY IS BEST
KNOWN AS AN HERBAL ANTIBIOTIC BECAUSE IT CONTAINS
BERBERINE, A COMPOUND ALSO FOUND IN GOLDENSEAL. BERBERINE
ALSO HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS,
ACCORDING TO MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND AUTHOR
OF NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS.
IN ONE CHINESE STUDY, BERBERINE REDUCED VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS BY MORE THAN 50 PERCENT IN MORE
THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO USED IT. IN ADDITION TO
GOLDENSEAL, OTHER HERBS WITH BERBERINE INCLUDE
OREGON GRAPE AND GOLDTHREAD.
THE BEST WAY TO TAKE THIS HERB IS TO BUY A STANDARDIZED HERBAL EXTRACT AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB
SHOP AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE
TO MAKE A TEA USING A TEASPOON OR TWO OF THE DRIED HERB
TO A CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS A FAVORITE CHINESE HEART TONIC. I KNOW OF NO STUDIES SHOWING THAT GINKGO HAS ANTIARRHYTHMIC EFFECTS, BUT LIKE HAWTHORN, IT IMPROVES BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEART AND
LESSENS CORONARY DEMAND FOR OXYGEN, THUS REDUCING SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND
BARBERRY
ALONG WITH ITS CLOSE RELATIVE OREGON GRAPE,
BARBERRY MAY STIMULATE
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND
HELP FIGHT DAMAGE FROM
FREE RADICALS.
120
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMI A
CHEST PAIN. IF I HAD AN ARRHYTHMIA, I WOULD INCLUDE GINKGO AMONG MY HERBAL
TREATMENTS.
YOU CAN BUY GINKGO EXTRACTS AT MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES; FOLLOW THE PACKAGE
DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER. IN
LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
V HOREHOUND (MARRUBIUM VULGARE). HOREHOUND IS BEST KNOWN AS A
TREATMENT FOR COUGHS AND COLDS BECAUSE THE TWO KEY COMPOUNDS IT CONTAINS, MARRUBIIN AND MAMABIC ACID, ARE GOOD EXPECTORANTS. BUT THESE COMPOUNDS ALSO HAVE
A NORMALIZING EFFECT ON HEART RHYTHM. YOU CAN MAKE A TEA USING TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF THE HERB AND DRINK A CUP AFTER LUNCH AND DINNER.
V MOTHERWORT (LEONURUS CARDIACA). WITH A NAME LIKE CARDIACA, THIS
HERB MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HELP HEART PROBLEMS, AND SCIENCE CONFIRMS THAT IT DOES.
CHINESE STUDIES SHOW THAT IT SLOWS A RAPID HEARTBEAT, GENERALLY IMPROVING CARDIAC
ACTIVITY. IT ALSO HELPS TRANQUILIZE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, REDUCING THE ANXIETY, NERVOUS TENSION AND STRESS THAT MAY ACCOMPANY OR TRIGGER HEART PROBLEMS.
THE CHINESE REPORTEDLY CONSUME AS MUCH AS NINE OUNCES (250 GRAMS) A
DAY. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT MUCH TO ME. I'D SUGGEST TRYING ABOUT A HALF-OUNCE IN
THREE CUPS OF BOILING WATER FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS TO SEE IF IT HELPS.
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND OTHER PLANTS CONTAINING MAGNESIUM. ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES I'VE SEEN, MORE THAN 70 PERCENT OF AMERICANS
MAY GET INSUFFICIENT MAGNESIUM. MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH ARRHYTHMIA.
SCIENTISTS NOTE THAT MAGNESIUM, AT DOSES OF 250 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, HELPS PREVENT
CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA.
PURSLANE IS VERY RICH IN MAGNESIUM (NEARLY 2 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS).
GREEN BEANS, POPPY SEEDS, OATS, COWPEAS AND SPINACH ARE ALSO GOOD SOURCES. IN
SEASON, I COOK PURSLANE LIKE SPINACH AND EAT SEVERAL OUNCES AT A TIME.
V REISHI (GANODERMA LUCIDUM). SIXTEENTH-CENTURY MING DYNASTY TEXTS
SAY THAT THIS MARVELOUS CHINESE MEDICINAL MUSHROOM "MENDS THE HEART." AND MY
GOOD FRIEND, PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D.,
SAYS IN HIS BETTER HEALTH WITH (MOSTLY) CHINESE HERBS AND FOOD THAT REISHI HAS
CONSIDERABLE VALUE IN PREVENTING AND TREATING ARRHYTHMIA.
REISHI IS A HEART TONIC, LIKE HAWTHORN AND GINKGO. IT IMPROVES BLOOD FLOW TO
THE HEART, REDUCES CORONARY DEMAND FOR OXYGEN AND HELPS EASE THE CHEST PAIN
OF ANGINA. I MAKE REISHI TEA USING THREE TO SIX TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP
OF BOILING WATER.
V SCOTCH BROOM (CYTISUS SCOPARIUS). THIS HERB IS USEFUL AS A HEART
TONIC, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN EXPERT COMMITTEE THAT JUDGES THE
SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES. THE PRINCIPAL ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IS
AN ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC COMPOUND, SPARTEINE.
I 121
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA USING ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING
WATER. DRINK UP TO TWO CUPS A DAY. ONE NOTE OF CAUTION: SCOTCH BROOM ALSO CONTAINS THE COMPOUND TYRAMINE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH THE
CLASS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS KNOWN AS MAO INHIBITORS. IF YOU TAKE AN
ANTIDEPRESSANT, FIND OUT IF IT'S AN MAO INHIBITOR, AND IF IT IS, DON'T USE THIS HERB.
V VALERIAN (VALERIANA OFFICINALIS). VALERIAN IS BEST KNOWN AS AN HERBAL
SLEEP AID, AND WITH GOOD REASON. BUT HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY,
PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC
THERAPIES, SAYS THAT VALERIAN ALSO CONTAINS PROVEN ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC COMPOUNDS. IN
FACT, THIS HERB WAS USED FOR ARRHYTHMIAS AND PALPITATIONS IN ROMAN TIMES.
VALERIAN ALSO HAS OTHER HEART BENEFITS: IT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE, INCREASES
BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEART AND IMPROVES THE HEART'S PUMPING ABILITY.
THIS HERB SMELLS PRETTY FOUL, BUT IN SPITE OF THIS, I'D TRY A TEA MADE WITH
ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. DRINK TWO TO THREE
CUPS A DAY. IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TASTE, TRY CAPSULES OR A TINCTURE INSTEAD.
BOTH THE DRIED HERB AND TINCTURE ARE AVAILABLE AT HEALTH FOOD STORES OR HERB
SHOPS. FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
K
ATHI KEVILLE IS A CALIFORNIA HERBALIST WHOM I LIKE AND RESPECT. LIKE
ME, SHE OFTEN SPENDS DAYS CHAINED TO HER COMPUTER. UNLIKE ME, SHE
DEVELOPED CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (CTS), CAUSED BY COMPRESSION OF THE NERVE
THAT PASSES THROUGH THE "TUNNEL" FORMED BY THE WRIST BONES. THE SYMPTOMS OF
CTS ARE PAIN, WEAKNESS, FINGER STIFFNESS AND A PINS-AND-NEEDLES SENSATION.
AS KEVILLE'S CTS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE, SHE HAD TO GIVE UP HER MASSAGE
PRACTICE AND STOP PLAYING THE RECORDER BECAUSE SHE LOST SO MUCH SENSATION IN
HER FINGERS. SHE COULD BARELY FINISH TYPING THE MANUSCRIPT FOR HER BOOK, THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA. FINALLY, HER CTS GOT SO BAD THAT SHE LOST THE
ABILITY TO TURN THE DOORKNOB TO HER HOUSE.
THAT'S WHEN KEVILLE GOT A GENDE REMINDER FROM AN HERBALIST FRIEND ABOUT
PRACTICING WHAT SHE PREACHED. SHE ADOPTED AN AGGRESSIVE NATURAL HEALING
PROGRAM. SHE CONSULTED AN EXCELLENT OSTEOPATH, WHO MANIPULATED HER WRISTS
AND ENCOURAGED HER TO EXERCISE, USE MORE HERBS AND MANAGE HER STRESS MORE
122
CARPAL TUNNE L SYNDROME
EFFECTIVELY. SHE RECEIVED REGULAR MASSAGES WITH RELAXING AROMATHERAPY OILS.
SHE TOOK HER OWN HERBAL NERVE PAIN FORMULA AND ALSO SLATHERED LIBERAL AMOUNTS
OF HERBAL OILS ON HER WRISTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
HER RECOVERY WAS SLOW, BUT SHE DID RECOVER, AND WITHOUT THE WRIST SURGERY
THAT IS FREQUENTLY PERFORMED FOR CTS.
REPETITIVE MOVEMENTS HIT HOME
I MAY USE A COMPUTER AS MUCH AS KEVILLE, OR EVEN MORE—SOMETIMES AS
MUCH AS 14 HOURS A DAY. WHY HAVEN'T I DEVELOPED CTS?
BEING A MAN IS CERTAINLY A FACTOR. WOMEN DEVELOP CARPAL TUNNEL PROBLEMS
MORE THAN MEN DO BECAUSE THE CYCLICAL HORMONE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE MENSTRUAL
CYCLE, PREGNANCY AND MENOPAUSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SWELLING OF THE TISSUES SURROUNDING THE CARPAL TUNNEL. BUT I ALSO THINK MY HAND EXERCISES HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT. ADOPTING A CHINESE TECHNIQUE THAT IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY, I HOLD TWO
STEEL BALLS IN ONE HAND AND ROLL THEM AROUND WHEN I'M NOT TYPING. THE CHINESE
BALLS PROVIDE A GENTLE FORM OF EXERCISE, AND THE ROLLING MOTION MASSAGES THE TINY
MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS OF THE HANDS AND WRISTS. WHEN I'M AT THE COMPUTER, I
TAKE FREQUENT BREAKS TO TWIRL THE CHINESE BALLS IN EACH HAND.
CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME IS CONSIDERED A REPETITIVE MOTION INJURY—CUMULATIVE TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTANT RAPID USE OF THE FINGERS (LOW-INTENSITY,
HIGH-FREQUENCY FINGER WORK). CTS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES, THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD OF BOOKKEEPERS AND SUPERMARKET CHECKOUT CLERKS WHO PUNCHED
BUTTONS ALL DAY LONG. BUT IT DID NOT BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD UNTIL THE 1980S,
WHEN PERSONAL COMPUTERS CAME TO DOMINATE SO MANY WORKPLACES. SUDDENLY
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE'S JOBS REQUIRED THE KIND OF STEADY, RAPID FINGER MOVEMENTS
THAT CAN CAUSE REPETITIVE MOTION INJURIES LIKE CTS. IT IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR SOME
MUSICIANS, FACTORY WORKERS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO MUST CONSTANTLY USE THEIR
HANDS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE QUITE A FEW HERBS THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THIS
PROBLEM.
V * ^ WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK, THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF
ASPIRIN, CONTAINS CHEMICALS (SALICYLATES) THAT BOTH RELIEVE PAIN AND REDUCE INFLAMMATION. YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY OTHER HERBS RICH IN SALICYLATES, NOTABLY MEADOWSWEET AND WINTERGREEN.
WITH ANY OF THESE HERBS, I'D STEEP ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED, POWDERED
BARK OR FIVE TEASPOONS OF FRESH BARK FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO, THEN STRAIN OUT THE
PLANT MATERIAL. YOU CAN ADD LEMONADE TO MASK THE BITTER TASTE AND DRINK TWO
123
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TO THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN,
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
V V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE
TEA IS BEST KNOWN AS A TASTY WAY TO CALM JANGLED
NERVES. BUT ITS ACTIVE COMPOUNDS (BISABOLOL,
CHAMAZULENE AND CYCLIC ETHERS) ALSO HAVE
POTENT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION. CAMOMILE
IS WIDELY USED IN EUROPE FOR MANY INFLAMMATORY DISEASES. IF I HAD CTS, I'D DRINK SEVERAL
CUPS OF CAMOMILE TEA A DAY.
W PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS).
PINEAPPLE CONTAINS A PROTEIN-DISSOLVING (PROTEOLYTIC) ENZYME, BROMELAIN, THAT IS OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR CTS.
"BROMELAIN HAS WELL-DOCUMENTED EFFECTS
ON VIRTUALLY ALL INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE," ACCORDING TO NATUROPATHS
JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR
UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, AND MICHAEL MURRAY,
N.D., CO-AUTHORS OF A TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL
MEDICINE. "BROMELAIN CAN REDUCE SWELLING,
INFLAMMATION AND PAIN. BROMELAIN IS EXTREMELY SAFE TO USE. IN HUMAN STUDIES, VERY
LARGE DOSES (NEARLY TWO GRAMS) HAVE BEEN
GIVEN WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS."
NATUROPATHS SUGGEST TAKING 250 TO 1,500
MILLIGRAMS OF PURE BROMELAIN A DAY, BETWEEN
CAMOMILE FLOWERS ARE USED TO
MAKE A SLEEP-INDUCING TINCTURE
AND A TEA WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES.
MEALS, TO TREAT INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS SUCH AS CTS. BROMELAIN IS AVAILABLE AT
MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES. SINCE I FAVOR FOOD SOURCES, HOWEVER, I PREFER TO GET MY
BROMELAIN FROM PINEAPPLE ITSELF. GINGER AND PAPAYA ALSO CONTAIN HELPFUL PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES. YOU MIGHT ENJOY A PROTEOLYTIC CTS FRUIT SALAD COMPOSED OF
PINEAPPLE AND PAPAYA AND SPICED WITH GRATED GINGER.
W RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS CAYENNE,
RED PEPPER CONTAINS SIX PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUNDS AND SEVEN THAT ARE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY. ESPECIALLY NOTEWORTHY IS CAPSAICIN. COMMERCIAL SALVES CONTAINING
CAPSAICIN, SUCH AS ZOSTRIX AND CAPZASIN-P, ARE WIDELY USED TO TREAT PAIN.
I WOULD TRY THIS HERB IF I HAD CTS. YOU MIGHT ADD SEVERAL TEASPOONS OF
POWDERED CAYENNE TO A QUARTER-CUP OF SKIN LOTION AND RUB IT ON YOUR WRISTS. OR
YOU COULD MAKE A CAPSAICIN LOTION BY STEEPING FIVE TO TEN RED PEPPERS IN TWO
124
UARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME
PINTS OF RUBBING ALCOHOL FOR A FEW DAYS. JUST WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTER
USING ANY TOPICAL CAPSAICIN TREATMENT, AS YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT IN YOUR EYES.
ALSO, SINCE SOME PEOPLE ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS COMPOUND, YOU SHOULD TEST
IT ON A SMALL AREA OF SKIN BEFORE USING IT ON A LARGER AREA. IF IT SEEMS TO IRRITATE
YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.
I'D ALSO SUGGEST ADDING A FEW DROPS OF LAVENDER OIL TO YOUR RED-PEPPER
SALVE. LAVENDER OIL IS A MAINSTAY OF AROMATHERAPY, USEFUL FOR TREATING INFLAMMATION AND BURNS. ITS AROMA IS ALSO QUITE RELAXING, WHICH HELPS WHEN YOU'RE
FEELING THE PAIN OF CTS.
W TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). THIS HERB CONTAINS CURCUMIN, A POTENT
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CHEMICAL. SOME STUDIES SUGGEST THAT CURCUMIN IS ONLY ABOUT
HALF AS EFFECTIVE AS THE PHARMACEUTICAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MEDICATION CORTISONE,
BUT CONSIDER THAT CORTISONE IS EXPENSIVE AND CAN HAVE NASTY SIDE EFFECTS. TURMERIC
IS MUCH EASIER ON THE SYSTEM AND THE POCKETBOOK, NOT TO MENTION A LOT TASTIER.
NATUROPATHS SUGGEST TAKING 250 TO 500 MILLIGRAMS OF PURE CURCUMIN A DAY,
BETWEEN MEALS. DRIED TURMERIC CONTAINS ABOUT 1 TO 4 PERCENT CURCUMIN, SO TO
GET THE DOSE THAT NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND, YOU WOULD HAVE TO CONSUME 10 TO
50 GRAMS (5 TO 25 TEASPOONS) OF DRIED TURMERIC. THAT'S A LOT MORE THAN EVEN I
WOULD ADD TO A CURRIED RICE DISH. INSTEAD, TRY USING TURMERIC LIBERALLY ON FOOD
AND THEN TAKING SOME MORE IN CAPSULES.
V COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE). MY GOOD FRIENDS, PHARMACOGNOSIST
(NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D., AND NOTED ARKANSAS HERBALIST
AND PHOTOGRAPHER STEVEN FOSTER, IN THEIR EXCELLENT ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS, EXPLAIN THAT APPLYING COMFREY TO THE SKIN CAN HELP RELIEVE PAIN,
SWELLING AND INFLAMMATION. THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THROUGH STUDIES USING LABORATORY ANIMALS. THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS ARE ALLANTOIN AND ROSMARINIC ACID.
COMFREY HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF BAD PRESS IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE IT ALSO CONTAINS PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS, COMPOUNDS THAT MAY CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE WHEN
THE HERB IS INGESTED. BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT COMFREY IS RISKY WHEN APPLIED TO THE SKIN, WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST FOR CTS (AND ARTHRITIS). ADD A
FEW TEASPOONS OF DRIED, POWDERED COMFREY TO THE RECIPE MENTIONED ABOVE FOR
RED PEPPER OR TO ANY FAVORITE SKIN CREAM.
V CUMIN (CUMINUM CYMINUM). CUMIN IS USED LIBERALLY IN MEXICAN
FOODS. MY FORMER U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE COLLEAGUE, MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST
STEPHEN BECKSTROM-STERNBERG, PH.D., AND I ONCE STUDIED THE PROPERTIES OF THIS
SPICE AND DISCOVERED THREE PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUNDS, SEVEN THAT ARE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND FOUR THAT COMBAT SWELLING. IF I HAD CTS, I'D USE LOTS OF CUMIN ON
FOOD AND ADD IT TO MY CURRIED RICE.
V SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). DR. BECKSTROM-STERNBERG AND I IDENTIFIED SIX
125
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS IN SAGE. IF I HAD CTS, FD USE THIS SPICE LIBERALLY IN
ALL SORTS OF FOODS, NOT JUST TURKEY STUFFING.
V FOODS HIGH IN VITAMIN B6. NATUROPATHS SUGGEST GETTING 40 TO 80 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN B6 TWICE A DAY TO TREAT CTS. IN ONE STUDY OF PEOPLE WITH THIS
CONDITION, TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE USING THIS AMOUNT OF B6 REPORTED IMPROVEMENT.
FOODS HIGH IN B6 INCLUDE CAULIFLOWER, WATERCRESS, SPINACH, BANANAS AND OKRA. I IT,WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH B6 TO TREAT CTS SOLELY FROM FOOD. IF YOU HAVE
THIS CONDITION, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER A SUPPLEMENT. THE DAILY VALUE IS ONLY 2 MILLIGRAMS, HOWEVER, AND GETTING TOO MUCH OF THIS VITAMIN HAS BEEN LINKED TO NERVE
DISORDERS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS THERAPY, PLEASE DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
CATARACTS
S
OME TIME BACK, I PUBLISHED A MAGAZINE ARTICLE ENTITLED "CATNIP AND
CATARACTS," WHICH EXPLORED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE HERB MOST CATS FIND
INTOXICATING MIGHT ALSO HELP PREVENT THE COMMON—AND POTENTIALLY BLINDING—
EYE DISEASE. IT WAS A SPECULATIVE PIECE, AND I PLAYED IT THAT WAY, NOT MAKING
ANY BIG PROMISES.
THIS NOTION IS STILL SPECULATIVE, BUT AS TIME HAS PASSED, I'VE BECOME INCREASINGLY PERSUADED THAT CATNIP IS A THREE-STAR HERB FOR CATARACT PREVENTION.
AND I THINK SEVERAL OTHER HERBS CAN HELP AS WELL.
I SHOULD SAY RIGHT AWAY THAT HERBS CAN'T CURE CATARACTS. THIS CONDITION IS
SERIOUS, AND ANYONE WITH EVEN THE FIRST HINT OF CATARACTS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE
UNDER A DOCTOR'S CARE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HERBS CAN HELP PREVENT THEM.
CLOUDED VISION
CATARACTS ARE CLOUDY AREAS THAT DEVELOP IN THE NORMALLY CLEAR LENS OF THE
EYE. AN ESTIMATED 20 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, MOSDY THE ELDERLY, HAS
CATARACTS. SOME FOUR MILLION AMERICANS HAVE SIGHT-IMPAIRING CATARACTS, AND AT
LEAST 40,000 HAVE BECOME LEGALLY BLIND BEFORE RECEIVING SURGICAL TREATMENT.
IN THE UNITED STATES, CATARACTS AFFLICT AROUND 5 PERCENT OF THOSE AGES 52 TO
64, 18 PERCENT OF THOSE AGES 65 TO 74 AND HALF OF THOSE 75 AND OLDER. BUT THE
FAINT BEGINNINGS OF THE CONDITION CAN BE DETECTED IN ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS OF
AMERICANS.
126
CATARACTS
THE MAINSTREAM MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS IS SURGERY. THE CLOUDED
LENS IS REMOVED FROM THE EYE, AND AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IS INSERTED. MORE THAN
500,000 CATARACT OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED EACH YEAR. THEY USUALLY RESTORE REASONABLY GOOD VISION, BUT THEY COST THE NATION A FORTUNE—MORE THAN $3.5 BILLION A YEAR.
CLOUD FACTORS
SCIENTISTS USED TO THINK THAT CATARACTS WERE CAUSED BY OLD AGE, ALONG WITH
THE BAD LUCK OF BEING SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE CONDITION. THEN RESEARCHERS NOTICED
THAT CERTAIN GROUPS ARE UNUSUALLY LIKELY TO GET CATARACTS. SMOKERS FACE A MUCH
GREATER THAN NORMAL RISK OF DEVELOPING THE CONDITION. THOSE WITH DIABETES OR
HEAVY METAL POISONING AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN USING STEROIDS FOR A LONG TIME
ARE ALSO AT INCREASED RISK.
NOW WE KNOW WHY. WHAT CLOUDS THE EYE LENS IS THE DAMAGE FROM OXIDATION, A BIOCHEMICAL PROCESS SET IN MOTION WHEN A HIGHLY REACTIVE FORM OF
OXYGEN CHANGES WITHIN OUR CELLS. SMOKING AND OTHER RISK FACTORS ALL INCREASE
OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY, FOR INSTANCE, A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO
SMOKED 30 CIGARETTES A DAY SHOWED A 60 PERCENT GREATER RISK OF DEVELOPING
CATARACTS.
CAN ANYTHING PREVENT CATARACTS? YOU BET—ANTIOXIDANTS.
ANTIOXIDANTS ARE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES THAT PREVENT OXIDATIVE DAMAGE BY
NEUTRALIZING FREE RADICALS, THE RENEGADE OXYGEN MOLECULES THAT ARE SO DAMAGING
TO THE BODY. AMONG THE BEST ANTIOXIDANTS IS VITAMIN A, WHICH WE GET FROM FOOD
IN THE FORM OF CAROTENOIDS LIKE BETA-CAROTENE. OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS INCLUDE VITAMINS C AND E, THE VITAMIN-LIKE FLAVONOIDS, AND THE MINERAL SELENIUM.
SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DIETS RICH IN VITAMINS C AND E HELP PREVENT CATARACTS. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT TAKING 1,000 MILLIGRAMS OF
VITAMIN C A DAY CAN SLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CATARACTS. WHICH BRINGS ME BACK
TO MY MAGAZINE ARTICLE ABOUT CATNIP. ITS LEAVES, AND THE LEAVES OF MANY MINT
RELATIVES LIKE ROSEMARY, CONTAIN GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF VITAMINS C AND E, SOME OF
WHICH CAN BE EXTRACTED IN CATNIP TEA OR A MIXED MINT TEA LIKE MY CATARACTEA.
IN ADDITION TO ANTIOXIDANTS, THE TRACE MINERALS MAGNESIUM AND MANGANESE
APPEAR TO PLAY A ROLE IN CATARACT PREVENTION. ENZYMES CONTAINING THESE MINERALS
HELP DISPOSE OF PROTEINS DAMAGED BY OXIDATION THAT CONTRIBUTE TO EYE CLOUDING.
CATNIP AND THE OTHER MINTS CONTAIN BOTH OF THESE ESSENTIAL TRACE MINERALS.
FINALLY, CATNIP AND OTHER MINTS ARE ALSO RICH IN FLAVONOIDS, AND SEVERAL
STUDIES HAVE NOW SHOWN HOW IMPORTANT FLAVONOIDS ARE.
ALTHOUGH FLAVONOIDS HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN PRAISED FOR THEIR PROPERTIES,
127
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THEY WERE IDENTIFIED DECADES AGO. ALBERT SZENT-GYORGYI, THE RESEARCHER WHO
FIRST DISCOVERED VITAMIN C IN 1928, WAS ALSO A CHAMPION OF FLAVONOIDS. HE
CALLED THEM VITAMIN P.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CATARACTS
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP PREVENT CATARACTS.
V \ V BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTITTUS). AS FAR BACK AS WORLD WAR I, BRITISH
FLIERS MUNCHED BILBERRIES BEFORE MISSIONS TO SHARPEN THEIR VISION. BILBERRY HAS
MANY BOTANICAL RELATIVES, INCLUDING BLUEBERRY, CRANBERRY AND HUCKLEBERRY, AND
SIMILAR CHEMICALS OCCUR IN OTHER FRUITS SUCH AS BLACKBERRY, RASPBERRY, GRAPE, PLUM
AND WILD CHERRY. ALL HAVE REPUTATIONS FOR AIDING VISION.
MODERN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE FRUITS CONTAIN COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS ANTHOCYANOSIDES, WHICH DO INDEED CONTRIBUTE TO VISUAL ACUITY. A GROUP OF ITALIAN
RESEARCHERS SHOWED THAT A MIXTURE OF ANTHOCYANOSIDES FROM BILBERRY PLUS VITAMIN E HALTED THE PROGRESSION OF LENS CLOUDING IN
A REMARKABLE 97 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH EARLYSTAGE CATARACTS.
NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND TAKING A STANDARDIZED
BILBERRY EXTRACT (CONTAINING 25 PERCENT ANTHOCYANIDIN) AT A DOSE OF 80 TO 160 MILLIGRAMS THREE
TIMES A DAY. THIS EXTRACT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WHEREVER HIGH-QUALITY HERBAL FORMULATIONS ARE SOLD.
I PREFER A CUP OF BLUEBERRIES, WHICH ARE MORE
READILY AVAILABLE THAN BILBERRIES. GERMAN HERBALISTS
SUGGEST A TEA MADE WITH TWO TO FOUR TABLESPOONS OF
CRUSHED BLUEBERRIES.
V \ \ CATNIP (NEPETA CATARIA). I'M NOT YET
READY TO SAY THAT CATNIP TEA IS GUARANTEED TO PREVENT CATARACTS. BUT I THINK THAT TWO CUPS OF CATNIP
(OR MINT) TEA A DAY SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE
YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPING THIS PROBLEM.
HOT CATNIP TEA IN WINTER AND ICED CATNIP TEA
IN SUMMER ARE QUITE TASTY. IN ADDITION TO HELPING
PREVENT CATARACTS, THIS HERB IS A MILD TRANQUILIZER, SO NOT ONLY WILL YOU STOP WORRYING ABOUT
CATARACTS QUITE AS MUCH, YOU'LL ALSO REDUCE YOUR
WORRIES IN GENERAL.
V W ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). A MINT RELATIVE OF CATNIP, ROSEMARY CONTAINS MORE THAN A DOZEN ANTIOXIDANTS. IT ALSO CONTAINS AT LEAST FOUR OTHER
KNOWN CATARACT FIGHTERS. THAT'S WHY I INCLUDE IT IN MY CARARACTEA. I'D ALSO SUGGEST
CATNIP
CATNIP, A MEMBER OF THE
MINT FAMILY, RELEASES A DISTINCTIVE AROMA WHEN ITS
MADE INTO AN HERBAL TEA.

USING ROSEMARY LIBERALLY IN
COOKING. IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD ON
ROASTED POTATOES AND IS OFTEN
USED IN CHICKEN DISHES.
VV BRAZIL NUT {BERTHOLETTIA EXCELSA). THESE NUTS
CONTAIN GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF VITAMIN E, PLUS THE ESSENTIAL TRACE
MINERAL SELENIUM, WHICH BOOSTS
VITAMIN E'S ANTIOXIDANT BENEFITS.
SELENIUM LEVELS IN THE EYE
LENSES OF PEOPLE WITH CATARACTS
ARE A MERE 15 PERCENT OF NORMAL,
SUGGESTING THAT SELENIUM SUPPLEMENTATION OR THE SELENIUM FROM
BRAZIL NUTS MIGHT HELP PREVENT
CATARACTS. AT LEAST, IT MIGHT SLOW
THEIR PROGRESSION. THE AVERAGE
BRAZIL NUT CONTAINS THE DAILY
VALUE FOR SELENIUM.
VV CARROT (DAUCUS
CAROTA). THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT
OF FOLKLORE THAT CARROTS ARE GOOD
FOR VISION. AS IT TURNS OUT, IT'S
MORE THAN FOLKLORE. ONE RESEARCHER AT THE PHARMACEUTICAL
FIRM HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE CITES
MORE THAN 30 STUDIES PROVIDING
EVIDENCE THAT CAROTENOIDS HELP
PREVENT WHAT HE CALLS THE THREE
CS: CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND CATARACTS. CAROTENOIDS
(INCLUDING BETA-CAROTENE) ARE THE
COMPOUNDS THAT GIVE CARROTS
THEIR ORANGE COLOR.
THIS CONCLUSION IS SUPPORTED BY A DECADE-LONG HARVARD STUDY INDICATING THAT BY GETTING 50 MILLIGRAMS OF CAROTENOIDS EVERY OTHER
DAY, YOU CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RISK OF CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND
CATARACTS.
CANDIED CAROTENOIDS
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECTACULAR WAY TO
ENJOY MANY OF THE EYE-PROTECTING YELLOW
VEGETABLES, THIS RECIPE CAN'T BE BEAT. IN
FACT, TAKE IT TO A THANKSGIVING FAMILY

INTERESTED IN THE RECIPE.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IT WOULD TAKE SEVEN GOOD-SIZE CARROTS TO PROVIDE 50 MILLIGRAMS OF
CAROTENOIDS. BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE MUNCHING ON CARROTS, WHIP UP SOME OF MY
CANDIED CAROTENOIDS. OR SIMPLY EAT MORE ORANGE, YELLOW AND DARK GREEN FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES, ALL OF WHICH ARE HIGH IN CAROTENOIDS.
VV ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONION IS ONE OF OUR BEST SOURCES OF QUERCETIN, A
COMPOUND THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN STUDIES TO HELP PREVENT CATARACTS IN PEOPLE WITH
DIABETES. WHILE I SUSPECT THAT IT WORKS FOR ALL KINDS OF CATARACTS, NO RESEARCH YET
CONFIRMS THIS.
IN ANY CASE, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO USE MORE ONIONS. WHEN YOU MAKE STEWS AND
SOUPS, LEAVE THE ONION SKIN ON WHILE COOKING TO ALLOW AS MUCH QUERCETIN AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE FOOD. DISCARD THE SKIN BEFORE SERVING THE DISH.
VV PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). PURSLANE IS HIGH IN ALL OF THE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP PREVENT CATARACTS—VITAMIN C, VITAMIN E, CAROTENOIDS AND OTHER POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS, NOTABLY ONE KNOWN AS GLUTATHIONE. JUST A HALF-CUP OF FRESH
PURSLANE CONTAINS HEALTHY AMOUNTS OF BETA-CAROTENE AND VITAMINS C AND E.
FRESH PURSLANE CAN BE AWFULLY HARD TO COME BY IF YOU DON'T GROW IT YOURSELF. IF YOU HAVE A GARDEN, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER INCLUDING IT IN YOUR
NEXT PLANTING. I RECENTLY TRANSPLANTED A THICK BED OF PURSLANE SEEDLINGS TO THE
MAIN PART OF MY GARDEN. I'LL EAT IT IN
SOUPS AND SALADS OR LIKE SPINACH FOR
THE REST OF THE YEAR.
VV TURMERI C (CURCUMA LONGA). IN ADDITION TO GOOD AMOUNTS OF VITAMINS C AND E AND CAROTENOIDS,
TURMERIC CONTAINS MANY OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS. TURMERIC IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN
MANY CURRY SPICE BLENDS. EXPERIMENT
WITH IT IN COOKING.
V CAPERS (CAPPARU SPINOSA).
MY OWN RESEARCH AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE WITH MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST
STEPHEN BECKSTROM-STERNBERG, PH.D.,
SHOWS THAT CAPERS ARE A VERY RICH SOURCE
J OF CATARACT-PREVENTING COMPOUNDS
KNOWN AS ALDOSE-REDUCTOSE INHIBITORS.
USE CAPERS WHENEVER YOU WANT EXTRA ZING IN COOKING.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE)* GINGER IS ANOTHER GOOD SOURCE
OF ANTIOXIDANTS. IT ALSO MAKES MY CATARACTEA TASTIER.
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN PROTECTING YOUR VISION AS YOU AGE? LEARN TO ENJOY THIS TEA
DAILY, AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT WILL
HELP YOU DO JUST THAT.
TO MAKE THE TEA, BOIL TWO QUARTS OF
WATER. REMOVE FROM THE HEAT AND ADD ONE
HANDFUL EACH OF CATNIP, ROSEMARY AND
LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA). ADD
A FEW TEASPOONS OF GRATED GINGER AND A
DASH OR TWO OF TURMERIC. STEEP FOR 20 MINUTES AND DRINK WARM OR COLD WITH LEMON
JUICE AND HONEY.

CNRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME
F
ATIGUE USED TO BE CONSIDERED ONLY A SYMPTOM, BUT IN THE LAST DECADE
OR SO, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS) HAS BECOME ONE OF THE NATION'S
MOST CONTROVERSIAL ILLNESSES. DEPENDING ON WHOM YOU TALK TO, THIS DISEASE EITHER DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL OR IT'S AN EPIDEMIC.
ALL SORTS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN FINGERED AS CAUSES: ALLERGIES, FOOD INTOLERANCES, DRUG REACTIONS, YEAST INFECTION, PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND CHRONIC INFECTION WITH THE EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (THE CULPRIT THAT CAUSES MONONUCLEOSIS),
JUST TO NAME A FEW.
ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES, 3 MILLION AMERICANS—90 MILLION PEOPLE
WORLDWIDE—SUFFER FROM THE WELL-DEFINED GROUP OF SYMPTOMS THAT SEEM TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH CFS. THESE SYMPTOMS, DOCTORS SAY, INCLUDE PROFOUND LETHARGY
NOT ALLEVIATED BY SLEEP, PLUS DEPRESSION, HEADACHE, FEVERS, MALAISE, MEMORY
LOSS, MENTAL CONFUSION, POOR CONCENTRATION, PAIN AND WEAKNESS OF THE JOINTS
AND MUSCLES, RECURRING INFECTIONS, SEVERE EXHAUSTION FROM MINOR ACTIVITIES,
SORE THROAT, STOMACH DISTRESS AND SWOLLEN LYMPH GLANDS. ODDLY ENOUGH, EVEN
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE SICK—DOCTORS
FIND LITTLE, IF ANYTHING, WRONG DURING A PHYSICAL EXAM, AND LABORATORY TESTS FREQUENTLY FAIL TO FIND ANY ABNORMALITIES.
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH ESTIMATES THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AT
RISK FOR CFS ARE WHITE, MIDDLE-CLASS WOMEN.
I BELIEVE CFS IS A VERY REAL CONDITION. I ALSO AGREE WITH MANY EXPERTS IN
THE FIELD THAT IT'S VERY CONFUSING. ANY NUMBER OF INFECTIONS, ALLERGIES, FOODS,
DRUGS, NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES AND OTHER ILLNESSES MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO IT. BECAUSE CFS IS SO MULTIFACETED, I SHY AWAY FROM ANYONE WHO CLAIMS TO UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THE CAUSE OR THE CURE.
I'D ADVISE ANYONE WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE TO FIND A GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CONDITION AND FOLLOW THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE TO HELP EXPLORE ALL POSSIBLE CAUSES. TO SEE WHAT HELPS AND WHAT HURTS YOU, BY ALL MEANS HAVE YOUR
DOCTOR TEST YOU FOR ALLERGIES, INCLUDING FOOD ALLERGIES.
ONE MORE NOTE BEFORE WE GET TO THE HERBS: ALMOST EVERY CFS EXPERT RECOMMENDS TRYING A WHOLE-FOOD, VEGETARIAN OR NEAR-VEGETARIAN DIET TO SEE IF IT
HELPS. EVEN IF IT DOESN'T CURE YOUR FATIGUE, IT SHOULD REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HEART
DISEASE, CANCER, OBESITY, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND MANY OTHER SERIOUS CONDITIONS. AND ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS WILL CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTE TO CHRONIC FATIGUE,
EVEN IF THEY DON'T CAUSE IT.
131
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT MAY PROVE HELPFUL.
"V%. ASSORTED ANTIVIRAL HERBS. SEVERAL HERBALISTS I RESPECT CLAIM TO RELIEVE
CHRONIC FATIGUE SUCCESSFULLY IN A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH COMBINATIONS OF
ANTIVIRAL HERBS: ECHINACEA, GOLDENSEAL, LICORICE, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS
MELISSA) AND GINGER. I THINK THIS APPROACH IS WORTH A TRY. YOU CAN MAKE A BLEND OF
EQUAL AMOUNTS OF THESE HERBS OR USE VARYING AMOUNTS, ADJUSTING THE BLEND TO YOUR
PERSONAL TASTE. MAKE A TEA USING A TEASPOON OR TWO OF YOUR FAVORITE BLEND AND HAVE
A CUP TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY. SUCH HERB TEAS CAN BE ENERGIZING.
V ASIAN GINSENG {PANAX GINSENG) AND SIBERIAN GINSENG (ELEUTHEROCOCCUS SENTICOSUS). COMMISSION E, THE GROUP OF SCIENTISTS THAT ADVISES THE
GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, ENDORSES GINSENG "AS A TONIC TO COMBAT FEELINGS
OF LASSITUDE AND DEBILITY, LACK OF ENERGY AND ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE, AND DURING
CONVALESCENCE." THE SUGGESTED DAILY DOSE IS ABOUT ONE TEASPOON STEEPED IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER TO MAKE
A TEA.
CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT GINSENG IMPROVES ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, ALTHOUGH IT TAKES
UP TO A MONTH OF REGULAR USE TO NOTICE THIS
HERB'S BENEFITS. GINSENG ALSO STIMULATES THE
IMMUNE SYSTEM, AN EFFECT THAT'S BEEN REPEATEDLY CONFIRMED IN EXPERIMENTS WITH ANIMALS.
REVERED IN ASIA FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AS
AN ENERGY-BOOSTING TONIC, GINSENG IS USED
TODAY BY RUSSIAN COSMONAUTS AND ASIAN
OLYMPIC ATHLETES AS AN "ADAPTOGEN," AN HERB
THAT INCREASES GENERAL RESISTANCE TO ALL TYPES
OF STRESS. IT DOES THIS IN ADDITION TO REDUCING
FATIGUE AND IMPROVING ALERTNESS, COORDINATION,
MEMORY AND STRESS-COPING ABILITIES.
SOME YEARS AGO, A CO-WORKER ASKED IF
THERE WERE ANY CAFFEINE IN AN "ENERGY PREPARATION" THAT HE WAS TAKING TO COMBAT FATIGUE.
THE FORMULA INCLUDED DAMIANA, GINSENG, ROYAL
JELLY AND SAW PALMETTO. HE SAID IT WAS REALLY
HELPING HIM, BUT HE WAS AFRAID IT WAS GETTING HIM UP EARLIER IN THE MORNING.
AND WHEN HE WOKE UP, HE SAID, HE HAD A TREMENDOUS URGE TO GO TO WORK.
NOPE, I TOLD HIM, NO CAFFEINE IN THERE. BUT I ADDED THAT GINSENG CAN BE
ASIAN GINSENG
A ROOT PRIMARILY IMPORTED FROM
CHINA AND KOREA, THIS TYPE OF
GINSENG WON MYTHIC RENOWN FOR
INCREASING LONGEVITY.
132
COLD S AN D FL U
QUITE A STIMULANT. I TOLD HIM TO KEEP TAKING IT AND TO GET UP AND WORK WHENEVER
THE URGE STRUCK HIM. (DON'T LET THAT ENERGY GO TO WASTE.)
V MATE (ILEX PARAGUAYENSIS). COMMISSION E APPROVES USING ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS A DAY IN TEA FOR BANISHING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FATIGUE. MOST OF MATE'S
ENERGY-BOOSTING ACTIVITY COMES FROM ITS CAFFEINE CONTENT. WHILE IT MAY BE GOOD AS
AN OCCASIONAL PICKER-UPPER, HOWEVER, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TAKING IT DAILY TO
TREAT CFS.
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING
MAGNESIUM. PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE JUICING FOR HEALTH OFTEN STRESS THE IMPORTANCE
OF GETTING MAGNESIUM FROM GREENS TO BOOST STAMINA AND ENERGY. IF YOU WANT TO GET
MORE MAGNESIUM, TRY PURSLANE, STRING BEANS, SPINACH, COWPEAS, LETTUCE, STINGING
NETTLE, POPPY SEEDS, LICORICE ROOT AND CORIANDER.
YOU COULD JUST TAKE A MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENT (THE DAILY VALUE IS 400 MILLIGRAMS), BUT PERSONALLY, I'D MUCH RATHER EAT A PURSLANE/STRING BEAN/SPINACH
SALAD WITH POPPYSEED DRESSING. WITH SUPPLEMENTS, YOU GET ONE MINERAL OR A
FEW PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS), BUT WITH WHOLE HERBS, YOU GET EVERY
THERAPEUTIC PHYTOCHEMICAL IN THE PLANT—POSSIBLY HUNDREDS.
V SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING FOLATE. ALTHOUGH I PREFER TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET YOUR VITAMINS AND MINERALS
FROM FOODS RATHER THAN SUPPLEMENTS, DEFICIENCIES OF FOLATE (THE NATURALLY OCCURRING FORM OF FOLIC ACID) ARE QUITE COMMON, AND YOU MIGHT NEED A FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENT. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN CONSUMES ONLY 61 PERCENT OF THE DAILY VALUE OF
400 MICROGRAMS OF FOLATE. WHETHER OR NOT YOU TAKE A SUPPLEMENT, HOWEVER, DON'T
NEGLECT GOOD FOOD SOURCES SUCH AS SPINACH, PINTO BEANS, ASPARAGUS, BROCCOLI, OKRA
AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
V WHEATGRASS (AGROPYRON, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER GRASSES.
JUICE ADVOCATES OFTEN RECOMMEND WHEATGRASS JUICE FOR FATIGUE. PERSONALLY, I THINK
ANY JUICED WHOLESOME GRASS, INCLUDING BARLEY, OATS, COUCHGRASS OR WHEAT, WOULD BE
HELPFUL.
COLDS AND FLU
C
ATHY WILKINSON BARASH, A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LIVES IN COLD SPRING
HARBOR, NEW YORK, IS THE AUTHOR OF EDIBLE FLOWERS: FROM GARDEN TO
PALATE. IN A LETTER ASKING ME TO REVIEW HER LIST OF EDIBLE FLOWERS BEFORE HER BOOK
133
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WENT TO PRESS, SHE MENTIONED: "I HAVE FOLLOWED THE ADVICE YOU GAVE ME ABOUT
ECHINACEA WHEN WE MET AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN DINNER AT AUNTIE
YUAN'S RESTAURANT IN MANHATTAN." MY ADVICE WAS TO TAKE ECHINACEA AT THE FIRST
SIGN OF SNIFFLES, AND BARASH SAYS SHE HASN'T HAD A SINGLE COLD SINCE SHE STARTED
FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE.
FOR CENTURIES, AMERICAN INDIANS OF THE GREAT PLAINS CHEWED ECHINACEA
ROOT OR USED IT IN TEA TO TREAT COLDS, FLU AND MANY OTHER AILMENTS. OVER THE LAST
FEW YEARS, PUBLICITY IN MANY MAGAZINES HAS TURNED ECHINACEA INTO THE HOTTEST
HEALTH FOOD STORE COLD REMEDY.
NOT TOO LONG AGO, A LEADING HEALTH MAGAZINE HEAPED PRAISE ON ECHINACEA
AS A COLD REMEDY, QUOTING ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM SEVERAL OF MY HERBAL BUDDIES. MARK BLUMENTHAL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN BOTANICAL COUNCIL
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, SAID, "I HAVEN'T HAD A COLD IN FOUR YEARS THANKS TO GARLIC,
ECHINACEA, ASTRAGALUS AND GOLDENSEAL." STEVEN FOSTER, NOTED ARKANSAS
HERBALIST, PHOTOGRAPHER AND CO-AUTHOR OF ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS, SAID, "I'VE GONE TWO OR THREE YEARS WITHOUT A COLD OR FLU BY TAKING
ECHINACEA." AND HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH,
NATURAL MEDICINE, AGREED: "SOME YEARS I DON'T GET ANY.. . I EAT RAW GARLIC. I
TAKE ECHINACEA."
UNIVERSAL SNIFFLING ANA SNEEZING
THE COMMON COLD, AN INFECTION OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT, IS CAUSED BY
ANY OF 200 DIFFERENT VIRUSES. THE VIRAL INFECTION AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM'S BATTLE
AGAINST IT PRODUCE THE ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR SYMPTOMS: SORE THROAT, NASAL CONGESTION,
RUNNY NOSE, WATERY EYES, HACKING COUGH AND SOMETIMES FEVER.
COLDS ARE SPREAD DIRECDY FROM PERSON TO PERSON BY COUGHING OR SNEEZING OR
BY HAND-TO-HAND CONTACT. THE VIRUS GETS ON ONE PERSON'S HANDS AND CAN SPREAD
TO THE HANDS OF OTHERS. IF YOUR VIRUS-CONTAMINATED HANDS TOUCH YOUR NOSE OR
EYES, YOU CATCH THE COLD. THE VIRUS CAN ALSO LIVE FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON EVERYDAY
SURFACES LIKE COUNTERS AND DOORKNOBS. YOUR HANDS CAN LITERALLY PICK IT UP THAT
WAY AS WELL. (THAT'S A GOOD REASON TO WASH YOUR HANDS OFTEN DURING COLD AND
FLU SEASON.)
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN ADULT SUFFERS TWO TO THREE COLDS A YEAR; THE AVERAGE
YOUNG CHILD HAS AS MANY AS NINE. THAT ADDS UP TO SOMETHING LIKE ONE BILLION
COLDS A YEAR.
IF YOU ARE GETTING MORE THAN YOUR FAIR SHARE OF COLDS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
MAY NEED HELP. MAYBE THE RIGHT HERBS CAN HELP YOU AS THEY HAVE ME. I
134
COLD S AN D FL U
DEFINITELY TAKE THESE HERBS, AND I CATCH FEWER COLDS THAN MY WIFE AND KIDS AND
GRANDKIDS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR COLAS ANA FLU
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW HERBS THAT CAN HELP BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM'S
COLD-FIGHTING POWER.
VVV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). I USE ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN
AS CONEFLOWER, MYSELF. THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH, MOST OF IT GERMAN, TO SHOW THAT IT
STRENGTHENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AGAINST COLD VIRUSES AND MANY OTHER GERMS AS WELL.
ECHINACEA INCREASES LEVELS OF A CHEMICAL IN THE BODY CALLED PROPERDIN, WHICH ACTIVATES THE PART OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING DEFENSE MECHANISMS
AGAINST VIRUSES AND BACTERIA.
ECHINACEA ROOT EXTRACTS ALSO POSSESS ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY AGAINST INFLUENZA,
HERPES AND OTHER VIRUSES. IN A STUDY OF 180 PEOPLE WITH FLU, ONE SCIENTIST FOUND
THAT 900 MILLIGRAMS OF AN ECHINACEA EXTRACT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SYMPTOMS.
THERE'S ONE ODD THING ABOUT GOOD ECHINACEA: SHORTLY AFTER INGESTING A TEA
OR TINCTURE, IT MAKES THE TONGUE NUMB OR TINGLY. DON'T WORRY, THOUGH: THIS REACTION IS HARMLESS.
BUT AS EFFECTIVE AS ECHINACEA CAN BE, IT'S NO MIRACLE COLD CURE. EVEN IF YOU
TAKE THIS HERB ON A REGULAR BASIS, YOU STILL MIGHT CATCH SOME COLDS. IN FACT,
SOME HERBALISTS CAUTION THAT YOU SHOULD NOT USE ECHINACEA EVERY DAY AS AN IMMUNE-ENHANCING TONIC BUT SHOULD TAKE IT ONLY WHEN YOU FEEL A COLD COMING ON
OR WHEN THOSE CLOSE TO YOU HAVE ONE. I'M STILL DEBATING WITH MYSELF ON THIS.
^ * V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). EAT ENOUGH GARLIC, AND MOST PEOPLE (ALONG
WITH THEIR COLD GERMS) WILL STAY AWAY FROM YOU. I'M JUST JOKING, AND THERE REALLY
ARE SOME EXCELLENT REASONS TO USE THIS HERB TO PREVENT COLDS AND FLU. GARLIC CONTAINS SEVERAL HELPFUL COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING ALLICIN, ONE OF THE PLANT KINGDOM'S
MOST POTENT, BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS.
AS ANYONE WHO HAS EVER HAD GARLIC BREATH KNOWS, THIS HERB'S AROMATIC COMPOUNDS ARE READILY RELEASED FROM THE LUNGS AND RESPIRATORY TRACT, PUTTING GARLIC'S
ACTIVE INGREDIENTS RIGHT WHERE THEY CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE AGAINST COLD VIRUSES.
V^V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). POURING A CUP OF BOILING WATER ONTO A
COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF FRESH, SHREDDED GINGER ROOT TO MAKE A GOOD HOT TEA REALLY
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AS A COLD TREATMENT. THAT'S BECAUSE THIS HERB CONTAINS NEARLY
A DOZEN ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS.
SCIENTISTS HAVE ISOLATED SEVERAL CHEMICALS (SESQUITERPENES) IN GINGER THAT
HAVE SPECIFIC EFFECTS AGAINST THE MOST COMMON FAMILY OF COLD VIRUSES, THE RHINOVIRUSES. SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS ARE REMARKABLY POTENT IN THEIR ANTI-RHINOVIRUS EFFECTS.
135
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
STILL OTHER CONSTITUENTS IN GINGER, GINGEROLS AND SHOGAOLS, HELP RELIEVE COLD
SYMPTOMS BECAUSE THEY REDUCE PAIN AND FEVER, SUPPRESS COUGHING AND HAVE A
MILD SEDATIVE EFFECT THAT ENCOURAGES REST.
GINGER HAS ONE MORE THING GOING FOR IT—IT'S TASTY. I'D SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF
GOOD REASONS TO MAKE GINGER A REGULAR PART OF YOUR COLD-TREATMENT ARSENAL.
W BLACK CHERRY (PRUNUS SEROTINA). DURING THEIR SUMMER SEASON, I
ADD CRUSHED CHERRIES TO MY LEMONADE. BASIC TEAS HAVE BEEN USED FOR COLDS, BUT
I PREFER THE FRUITS. THEY CONTAIN VITAMIN C AND BENZALDEHYDE, AND THEY TASTE GOOD, TOO, REALLY IMPROVING MY PINK LEMONADE.
VV CITRUS FRUITS AND OTHE R FOODS CONTAINING VITAMIN C. LIKE THE LATE LINUS PAULING,
PH.D., MANY HERBALISTS AND PHYSICIANS SUGGEST
TAKING 500 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C FOUR TIMES A
DAY FOR THE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS. SEVERAL STUDIES
DONE BY ELLIOT DICK, PH.D., EPIDEMIOLOGIST AT THE
RESPIRATORY VIRUS RESEARCH LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN IN MADISON HAVE SHOWN THAT
IT WORKS. (SOME PEOPLE DEVELOP DIARRHEA AFTER
TAKING AS LITTLE AS 1,200 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C A
DAY, BUT THIS IS RARE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS
THERAPY, CUT BACK ON THE AMOUNT OF VITAMIN C IF
YOU DEVELOP DIARRHEA.)
I TAKE VITAMIN C FOR COLDS, BUT I DO IT WITHOUT
USING MANY PILLS. I PREFER TO GET MINE FROM CAMUCAMU (MYRCIARIA DUBIA), THE AMAZONIAN FRUIT THAT
HAS THE WORLD'S HIGHEST VITAMIN C CONTENT. YOU UNDOUBTEDLY WON'T HAVE ACCESS YET TO THIS AMAZING
FRUIT, BUT OTHER GOOD SOURCES OF THIS VITAMIN INCLUDE ACEROLA, BELL PEPPERS, CANTALOUPE, CITRUS AND PINEAPPLE.
VV ELDERBERRY (SAMBUCUS NIGRA). THIS HERB CONTAINS TWO COMPOUNDS
THAT ARE ACTIVE AGAINST FLU VIRUSES. IT ALSO PREVENTS THE VIRUS FROM INVADING
RESPIRATORY TRACT CELLS.
A PATENTED ISRAELI DRUG (SAMBUCOL) THAT CONTAINS ELDERBERRY IS ACTIVE
AGAINST VARIOUS STRAINS OF VIRUSES. AT KIBBUTZ AZA IN ISRAEL, A FLU OUTBREAK PROVIDED A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TEST SAMBUCOL. TWENTY PERCENT OF FLU SUFFERERS WHO
USED IT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RELIEF OF FEVER, MUSCLE ACHES AND OTHER SYMPTOMS
WITHIN 24 HOURS, AND ANOTHER 73 PERCENT FELT BETTER AFTER THE SECOND DAY. IN
THREE DAYS, 90 PERCENT WERE REPORTED COMPLETELY CURED. IN A SIMILAR GROUP THAT
BLACK CHERRY
BLACK CHERRY, A MEMBER
OF THE ROSE FAMILY, IS A
VITAMIN C—RICH ADDITION
THAT WILL MAKE YOUR
LEMONADE LESS TART.
136
COLDS AND FLU
RECEIVED AN INACTIVE TREATMENT (A PLACEBO), ONLY 26 PERCENT WERE IMPROVED IN
TWO DAYS, AND IT TOOK MOST OF THEM SIX DAYS TO FEEL WELL AGAIN.
PUBLICITY FROM THIS TRIAL SOLD MORE THAN 30,000 BOTTLES OF SAMBUCOL IN ISRAEL WITHIN A YEAR. SAMBUCOL ALSO STIMULATES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HAS SHOWN
SOME ACTIVITY IN PRELIMINARY TRIALS AGAINST OTHER VIRUSES, SUCH AS EPSTEIN-BARR,
HERPES AND EVEN HIV.
SAMBUCOL HAS JUST BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND YOU MAY BE
ABLE TO FIND IT ON THE SHELVES AT YOUR PHARMACY OR HEALTH FOOD STORE. NEXT TIME I
HAVE THE FLU, I INTEND TO TRY IT. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A TEA FROM THE HERB ITSELF.
VV FORSYTHIA (FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA) AND HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA
JAPONICA). THESE HERBS ARE THE TRADITIONAL CHINESE APPROACH TO COLDS, FLU AND
OTHER VIRUSES. REVIEWING THE RESEARCH, I'M PERSUADED THAT THEY HAVE REAL ANTIVIRAL
BENEFITS. WHEN I FEEL A COLD OR FLU COMING ON, I MIX HONEYSUCKLE AND FORSYTHIA
WITH LEMON BALM TEA, WHICH ALSO HAS ANTIVIRAL ACTION. I FIND A HOT TEA COMBINATION
OF THE THREE HERBS ESPECIALLY NICE JUST BEFORE BED.
"VV ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONION IS A CLOSE RELATIVE OF GARLIC AND CONTAINS
MANY SIMILAR ANTIVIRAL CHEMICALS. ONE OLD FOLK REMEDY FOR COLDS RECOMMENDS
STEEPING RAW ONION SLICES OVERNIGHT IN HONEY, THEN TAKING THE RESULTING MIXTURE AT
INTERVALS LIKE A COUGH SYRUP. OF COURSE, YOU COULD ALSO SIMPLY USE MORE ONIONS IN
COOKING WHENEVER YOU HAVE A COLD.
V ANISE (PIMPINEUA ANISUM). COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HERBS TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, ENDORSES
ANISEED AS AN EXPECTORANT FOR GETTING RID OF PHLEGM. IN LARGE DOSES, IT ALSO HAS
SOME ANTIVIRAL BENEFITS.
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA BY STEEPING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED ANISEED IN
A CUP OR TWO OF BOILING WATER FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. THEN STRAIN IT. SUGGESTED
DOSE: ONE CUP OF TEA, MORNING AND/OR NIGHT. THIS SHOULD HELP YOU COUGH UP
WHATEVER'S LOOSE AND ALSO HELP YOU FIGHT THE COLD. (IT ALSO TASTES GOOD.)
V EPHEDRA (EPHEDRA SINICA). ALSO KNOWN AS MA HUANG OR CHINESE
EPHEDRA, EPHEDRA IS A POWERFUL DECONGESTANT. IT CONTAINS CHEMICALS, EPHEDRINE
AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, THAT OPEN UP THE BRONCHIAL PASSAGES. PSEUDOEPHEDRINE
WORKS SO WELL THAT IT IS USED IN MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER DECONGESTANTS AND INSPIRED
THE COMMONLY KNOWN BRAND NAME SUDAFED.
ALONG WITH ITS DECONGESTANT ACTION, HOWEVER, EPHEDRA IS ALSO A POWERFUL
STIMULANT THAT CAN RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE AND CAUSE INSOMNIA AND JITTERS. IN FACT,
WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS, A NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIED FROM ABUSING THIS HERB WHEN
THEY OVERDOSED IN A MISGUIDED ATTEMPT TO GET HIGH, AND THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO REMOVE EPHEDRINE SUPPLEMENTS FROM THE
MARKET. BECAUSE OF EPHEDRA'S STIMULANT ACTION AND THOSE UNFORTUNATE FATALITIES,
137
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THIS HERB IS CONTROVERSIAL, AND SOME HERBALISTS DISCOURAGE USING IT AT ALL.
TO ME, EPHEDRA IS STILL THE HERBAL DECONGESTANT OF CHOICE. IT IS SAFE WHEN
USED RESPONSIBLY, BUT BECAUSE OF ITS MANY POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS, I HESITATE TO
RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT THIS PROVISO: BEFORE TAKING EPHEDRA, PLEASE DISCUSS IT
WITH YOUR DOCTOR. TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, START WITH A WEAK TEA.
V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). BOTH ANTISEPTIC AND IMMUNE
STIMULATING, GOLDENSEAL REPORTEDLY INCREASES THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE SPLEEN, AN
ORGAN THAT'S THE STAGING AREA FOR THE FIGHTING CELLS OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM.
THE MAJOR HEALING COMPONENT IN GOLDENSEAL, BERBERINE, ACTIVATES SPECIAL
WHITE BLOOD CELLS (MACROPHAGES) THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DESTROYING BACTERIA,
FUNGI, VIRUSES AND TUMOR CELLS. SEVERAL RELATED CHEMICALS IN THE HERB APPEAR
TO HELP THE BERBERINE DO ITS JOB.
V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHISA GLABRA) LICORICE CONTAINS ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS
THAT INDUCE THE RELEASE OF INTERFERONS, THE BODY'S OWN ANTIVIRAL CONSTITUENTS.
LICORICE ALSO HAS A PLEASANTLY SWEET TASTE THAT OFFSETS THE BITTERNESS OF SEVERAL OF
THE OTHER COLD HERBS (GOLDENSEAL AND WILLOW), SO IT'S GOOD IN COMBINATION WITH
THEM.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS) AND OTHER MALLOWS. MARSH
MALLOW HAS BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AS A SOOTHING HERB FOR COLD-RELATED
COUGH AND SORE THROAT AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS. MARSH MALLOW ROOTS CONTAIN A SPONGY MATERIAL CALLED MUCILAGE THAT SOOTHES INFLAMED MUCOUS MEMBRANES,
PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS THAT THE PLANT IS
KNOWN TO CONTAIN.
COMMISSION E ENDORSES MARSH MALLOW, HOLLYHOCK AND OTHER MALLOWS FOR
COUGH AND SORE THROAT.
MOST MEMBERS OF THE MALLOW FAMILY, INCLUDING OKRA AND ROSELLE (THE RED IN
RED ZINGER TEA), CONTAIN SOOTHING MUCILAGE. THIS SON OF ALABAMA SUGGESTS THAT
YOU TRY—AT LEAST ONCE—ADDING A LOT OF OKRA TO YOUR CHICKEN SOUP. IT ADDS
SOMETHING EXTRA TO THE SOUP'S COLD-RELIEVING BENEFITS.
V MULLEIN (VERBASCUM THAPSUS), A TEA MADE WITH MULLEIN FLOWERS PROVIDES THROAT-SOOTHING MUCILAGE AND ALSO HAS AN EXPECTORANT EFFECT. THE PLANT REPORTEDLY CONTAINS COMPOUNDS THAT INHIBIT FLU VIRUSES. I HAVE HAD GOOD SUCCESS WITH
MULLEIN LEAF TEAS AS WELL.
V SENECA SNAKEROOT (POLYGALA SENEGA). COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS
SENECA SNAKEROOT AS AN EXPECTORANT FOR REDUCING UPPER RESPIRATORY PHLEGM. TO
MAKE A TEA, USE ABOUT ONE TEASPOON PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. (THIS HERB IS ALSO
RECOMMENDED FOR TREATMENT OF BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.)
V SLIPPERY ELM (UBNUS RUBRA). FINALLY, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GOT SOMETHING RIGHT. IT HAS DECLARED SLIPPERY ELM A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE THROAT
138
COLD S AND FL U
AND RESPIRATORY SOOTHER. SLIPPERY ELM WAS A MEDICAL MAINSTAY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR
MORE THAN 150 YEARS AND WAS LONG LISTED IN THE NATION'S OFFICIAL GUIDES TO THERAPEUTICS. THE BARK CONTAINS LARGE QUANTITIES OF A MUCILAGE THAT ACTS AS AN EFFECTIVE
THROAT SOOTHER AND COUGH SUPPRESSANT.
V WATERCRESS (NASTURTIUM OFFICINALE). COMMISSION E SUGGESTS USING
TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRY WATERCRESS TO MAKE A TEA FOR TREATING COLD-RELATED
RUNNY NOSE AND COUGH. OR TRY AN OUNCE OF FRESH WATERCRESS—IT MAKES A GREAT ADDITION TO A SALAD.
GINGER AND WATERCRESS MAKE A PIQUANT COMBINATION. FOR COLDS IN SUMMER,
WHEN FRESH WATERCRESS IS ABUNDANT, I'D SUGGEST COMBINING THEM.
V WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK IS AN HERBAL SOURCE OF
ASPIRIN; THE COMPOUND SALICIN, WHICH IS FOUND IN WILLOW, IS A CHEMICAL PRECURSOR OF
MODERN ASPIRIN THAT HAS A VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL EFFECT. COMMISSION E RECOGNIZES
WILLOW BARK AS A PAIN RELIEVER AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FEVER REDUCER THAT HELPS RELIEVE MANY COLD AND FLU SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SORE THROAT, FEVER, HEADACHE AND
OTHER ACHES.
MANY HERBALISTS RECOMMEND THE BARK OF THE WHITE WILLOW (S. ALBA), BUT IT
DOESN'T CONTAIN MUCH SALICIN—ONLY 0.5 TO 1 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS.
OTHER SPECIES CONTAIN MUCH MORE HERBAL ASPIRIN. THESE INCLUDE VIOLET WILLOW
(S. DAPHNOIDES), CRACK WILLOW (S.FRAGILIS) AND PURPLE OSIER (5. PURPUREA). IF POSSIBLE, USE THESE MORE SALICIN-RICH WILLOWS. BUT IN A PINCH, YOU CAN USE WHITE
WILLOW. IT TAKES ONLY ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON TO A TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB MADE
INTO A TEA TO PROVIDE 100 MILLIGRAMS OF SALICIN, WHICH SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO RELIEVE THE ACHES RELATED TO COLDS. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO
ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
ALSO REMEMBER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT GIVE EITHER ASPIRIN OR ITS NATURAL HERBAL
ALTERNATIVES TO CHILDREN WITH COLDS. WHEN CHILDREN TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE DRUGS FOR
VIRAL INFECTIONS (ESPECIALLY COLDS, FLU AND CHICKEN POX), THERE'S A CHANCE THAT
THEY MIGHT DEVELOP REYE'S SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION THAT DAMAGES THE LIVER AND BRAIN.
V GARLIC-AND-ONION CHICKEN SOUP. I HEARTILY AGREE WITH THE FOLKLORIC
TRADITION THAT HOT, SPICY CHICKEN SOUP IS GOOD FOR COLDS AND FLU. JUST MAKE SURE YOU
USE LOTS OF GARLIC AND ONIONS. AND ALONG WITH YOUR VEGETABLES, THROW IN SOME
GINGER AND HOT RED PEPPER. GOOD FOOD—AND GOOD MEDICINE.
139
CONSTIPATION
A
FEW YEARS AGO, I WAS INTERVIEWED FOR DAN RATHER'S EYE ON AMERICA PROGRAM ON CBS. IN ANOTHER SEGMENT OF THE SAME PROGRAM, RATHER INTERVIEWED THE COMMISSIONER OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), DAVID
KESSLER, M.D. THE PROGRAM SHOWED ME IN MY HABITUAL FIELDWORK ENVIRONMENT,
ON LOCATION IN ECUADOR, WEARING MY EXOTIC JUNGLE GARB. DR. KESSLER WAS SHOWN
IN HIS OFFICE WEARING HIS USUAL COAT AND TIE. ALTHOUGH WE NEVER ACTUALLY MET OR
DEBATED ON THAT PROGRAM, THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR GARB SPOKE VOLUMES.
DR. KESSLER AND I DISAGREED ABOUT HERBS AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS. HE
HAS COME DOWN RATHER HARD ON THEM, WHILE I AM CONVINCED THAT THEY CAN BE
USEFUL. THEY'RE A CHEAP WAY TO PREVENT SOME CONDITIONS, AMELIORATE OTHERS AND
EVEN CURE A FEW. BUT THE FDA DOES NOT ALLOW ANY MEDICINAL CLAIMS FOR HERBS
AND SUPPLEMENTS UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO FDA SATISFACTION WITH EXTENSIVE CLINICAL TRIALS.
AS OF 1995, IT COST $500 MILLION TO JUMP THROUGH THE FDA HOOPS TO PROVE
ANY NEW DRUG, HERB OR SUPPLEMENT TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. FEW MARKETERS OF
HERBS OR SUPPLEMENTS HAVE THAT KIND OF SPENDING MONEY. DRUG COMPANIES,
WHICH DO HAVE THE MONEY, CAN JUSTIFY THE EXPENSE BECAUSE ONCE THEY GET A NEW
DRUG APPROVED, THEY USUALLY HAVE A PATENT ENTITLING THEM TO EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR MANY YEARS. DURING THAT TIME THEY CAN RECOUP MANY TIMES OVER
THE INVESTMENT MADE IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS. BUT WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD SPEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO PROVE THAT PRUNE JUICE IS A GOOD LAXATIVE?
(IT IS.) YOU CAN'T PATENT PRUNES, SO YOU COULD NEVER MAKE YOUR MONEY BACK.
IN PRAISE OR PRUNES
WHEN DAN RATHER'S PRODUCER CALLED, HE ASKED ME WHAT QUESTIONS RATHER
SHOULD ASK DR. KESSLER. I TOLD HIM TO HAVE RATHER OFFER DR. KESSLER A BOTDE OF
PRUNE JUICE AND ASK IF HE CONSIDERED IT A SAFE, EFFECTIVE LAXATIVE. IF HE ANSWERED
NO, I SUGGESTED THAT RATHER REQUEST THAT DR. KESSLER DRINK SOME AND EXPERIENCE THE RESULTS FOR HIMSELF. IF HE ANSWERED YES, I SUGGESTED THAT RATHER ASK
WHY FDA LABELING REGULATIONS PROHIBIT PRUNE JUICE MARKETERS FROM STATING THAT
PRUNE JUICE IS A SAFE, EFFECTIVE, GENTLE LAXATIVE.
AT MY SUPERMARKET, PRUNE JUICE COSTS ONLY $1.30 A QUART, MAKING IT PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST, LEAST UNPLEASANT LAXATIVE NOW AVAILABLE. AT MY NEARBY HERB
STORE, EFFECTIVE BOTANICAL LAXATIVES—RHUBARB ROOT, CASCARA SAGRADA BARK, SENNA
140
CONSTIPATION
PODS AND LEAVES AND PSYLLIUM SEEDS AND HUSKS—ARE ALMOST AS CHEAP, BUT THEY
DON'T TASTE HALF AS GOOD.
MEANWHILE, FDA-APPROVED COMMERCIAL LAXATIVES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE
SENNA, CASCARA SAGRADA OR PSYLLIUM IN THEM, ARE COMPARATIVELY COSTLY. AND
MANY AMERICANS DO USE PRUNE JUICE AS A LAXATIVE. SO WHY WON'T THE FDA ALLOW
IT TO BE LABELED AS SUCH?
FACTS ON FIBER
THE SAD FACT IS THAT MOST AMERICANS PROBABLY WOULDN'T NEED A LAXATIVE,
HERBAL OR OTHERWISE, IF THEY ATE RIGHT. DOCTORS KNOW THAT A HIGH-FIBER DIET CONTROLS CONSTIPATION BY KEEPING THINGS MOVING THROUGH THE INTESTINE.
THANKS TO A FAMILY HISTORY OF COLON CANCER, I WAS ALREADY A HIGH-FIBER FREAK
WHEN I FIRST HEARD A TALK BY DENIS BURKITT, M.D., A RESPECTED BRITISH SURGEON WHO
HAS SPENT A LIFETIME WORKING IN EAST AFRICA. DR. BURKITT NOTED THAT IN NONINDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES, AMONG THEM THE AFRICAN COMMUNITIES WHERE HE WORKED, PEOPLE
EAT A VERY HIGH-FIBER DIET AND RARELY SUFFER FROM CONSTIPATION. IN FACT, THE ONLY
PEOPLE DR. BURKITT EVER SAW WITH CONSTIPATION WHILE IN AFRICA WERE WEALTHY
PEOPLE WHO ATE THE SAME LOW-FIBER DIET THAT SO MANY AMERICANS EAT.
HERE'S A SURE-FIRE FORMULA TO CREATE A PROBLEM WITH CONSTIPATION: TAKE ALL
THE FIBER-RICH FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND WHOLE GRAINS OUT OF YOUR DIET. IN THEIR PLACE
EAT LOTS OF MEATS, FATS AND DAIRY FOODS. NO WONDER AN ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT OF
AMERICANS SUFFER FROM CONSTIPATION, WITH AT LEAST 20 PERCENT OF THE ELDERLY
COMPLAINING OF IT.
WHEN I SAY THAT DIET CAN CONTROL CONSTIPATION, I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT
PRUNE JUICE. EVERY WHOLE-GRAIN ITEM AND EVERY FIBER-RICH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
HELPS PREVENT AND RELIEVE CONSTIPATION. IN FOLK MEDICINE THE FOODS THAT GET SPECIAL RECOGNITION AS LAXATIVES INCLUDE ALMONDS, APPLES, AVOCADOS, CHICORY, DANDELION, DATES, ENDIVE, FIGS, FLAXSEED, GRAPES, MANGOS, PAPAYAS, PARSLEY,
PERSIMMONS, PINEAPPLE, PRUNES, RHUBARB, RUTABAGAS, SOYBEANS, TURNIPS, WALNUTS AND WATERCRESS. YOU MIGHT EASILY CONTRIVE ANY NUMBER OF SOUPS AND SALADS
FROM THIS LIST.
IF YOU ARE CONSTIPATED, THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS CHANGE YOUR DIET TO
THE "DOUBLE HIGH FIVE" BY EATING FIVE FRUITS AND FIVE VEGETABLES A DAY. IF YOU ARE
STILL CONSTIPATED AFTER TWO DAYS, INCREASE YOUR FRUIT AND VEGGIE INTAKE WHILE DIMINISHING YOUR INTAKE OF LOW-FIBER FOODS LIKE MEATS AND REFINED BREADS. ALSO,
I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU AVOID TEA IF CONSTIPATION IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU. TEA IS
RICH IN TANNINS, WHICH IS ONE REASON THAT IT IS RECOMMENDED AS A TREATMENT FOR DIARRHEA. TANNINS HELP BIND STOOLS AND HOLD BACK BOWEL MOVEMENTS.
141
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE JUICES ALSO WORK, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT RETAIN MUCH OF
THEIR FIBER. PRUNE JUICE TOPS THE LIST, OF COURSE, BUT SOME JUICE ADVOCATES SAY
THAT APPLE-PEAR JUICE IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD LAXATIVE. AMONG VEGETABLE JUICES,
ASPARAGUS, JFCAMA AND POTATO HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED.
SOME PEOPLE WHO FAVOR JUICING USE MACHINES THAT EJECT MOST OF THE FIBER.
WHEN IT COMES TO TREATING CONSTIPATION, THAT'S A BIG MISTAKE, BECAUSE FIBER IS
PRECISELY WHAT YOU WANT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CONSTIPATION
SEVERAL HERBS CAN ALSO HELP PREVENT AND TREAT CONSTIPATION.
VV FLAX (LINUM USITATISSIMUM). ALSO KNOWN AS LINSEED, FLAXSEED AS AN
HERBAL TREATMENT FOR CONSTIPATION GETS AN ENDORSEMENT FROM COMMISSION E, THE
BODY OF SCIENTISTS THAT PROVIDES ADVICE ON HERBAL TREATMENTS TO GERMANY'S EQUIVALENT OF THE FDA. COMMISSION E SUGGESTS TAKING ONE TO THREE TABLESPOONS OF WHOLE
OR CRUSHED FLAXSEED TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY FOR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION.
A SPECIAL WORD OF WARNING: IF YOU TRY THIS REMEDY, MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALSO
GET PLENTY OF WATER—AT LEAST EIGHT FULL GLASSES A DAY—TO KEEP ALL THAT BULK
MOVING THROUGH YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.
VV PSYLLIUM (PLANTAGO OVATA). TINY PSYLLIUM SEEDS CONTAIN A FIBER CALLED
MUCILAGE, WHICH ABSORBS A GREAT DEAL OF FLUID IN THE GUT. THIS MAKES THE SEEDS
SWELL. THEY ADD BULK TO STOOL, AND AS STOOL BECOMES BULKIER; IT PRESSES ON THE COLON
WALL, TRIGGERING THE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS WE EXPERIENCE AS "THE URGE." PSYLLIUM IS
QUITE POPULAR IN GERMANY, AND COMMISSION E APPROVES TAKING THREE TO TEN TABLESPOONS A DAY FOR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION.
AS WITH FLAXSEED, PSYLLIUM NEEDS WATER TO WORK, AND IF YOU TAKE IT WITHOUT
WATER, IT MIGHT OBSTRUCT YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT.
AND IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA, DON'T TAKE THIS HERB. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL REPORTS OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO PSYLLIUM, INCLUDING A FEW SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS
FROM INHALED SEED DUST.
YOU SHOULD ALSO WATCH HOW YOU REACT TO THIS HERB IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES. IF
ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS DEVELOP AFTER YOU TAKE IT ONCE, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
^. ALOE (ALOE, VARIOUS SPECIES), BUCKTHORN (RHAMNUS CATHARTICAS), CASCARA SAGRADA (RHAMNUS PURSHIANUS), FRANGULA (FRANGULA
ALNUS) AND SENNA (CASSIA SENNA). THESE HERBS ALL CONTAIN POWERFUL NATURAL
LAXATIVE CHEMICALS CALLED ANTHRAQUINONES. WITH CERTAIN RESERVATIONS, COMMISSION
E ENDORSES ALL OF THESE HERBS FOR TREATING CHRONIC CONSTIPATION.
I SUGGEST TRYING ANY OF THESE ANTHRAQUINONE HERBS ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. YOU
SHOULD TRY A HIGH-FIBER DIET AND OTHER, GENTLER HERBS BEFORE REACHING FOR ANY OF
THESE. ANY HERB THAT CONTAINS ANTHRAQUINONES CAN BE UNPLEASANDY POWERFUL.
142
CORN S
IF YOU USE BUCKTHORN, CASCARA SAGRADA
OR FRANGULA, WHICH ARE ALL BARKS, INSIST ON
AGED BARK. THE ANTHRAQUINONES IN FRESH
BARK IRRITATE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND MAY
CAUSE BLOODY DIARRHEA AND VOMITING.
ANTHRAQUINONE LAXATIVES SHOULD NOT
BE TAKEN OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME OR
DURING PREGNANCY OR NURSING. IF YOU TAKE
THESE LAXATIVES FOR LONG PERIODS, YOU MAY
BECOME DEPENDENT ON THEM. THAT'S WHY I
CALL THEM A LAST RESORT.
V FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). LIKE PSYLLIUM, FENUGREEK
SEEDS CONTAIN FLUID-ABSORBING MUCILAGE. IF
YOU USE FENUGREEK SEEDS, MAKE SURE YOU
DRINK PLENTY OF WATER TO KEEP THINGS MOVING
ALONG. AND DON'T USE MORE THAN TWO TEASPOONS AT A TIME, AS ANY MORE MAY CAUSE ABDOMINAL DISTRESS.
V RHUBARB (RHEUM OFFICINALE). I LIKE THIS CONSTIPATION-RELIEF RECIPE FROM
PHYSICIAN RONALD HOFFMAN, M.D., THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN PARADE MAGAZINE: PUREE
THREE STALKS OF RHUBARB WITHOUT THE LEAVES. ADD ONE CUP OF APPLE JUICE, A QUARTER OF
A PEELED LEMON AND ONE TABLESPOON OF HONEY. IT WILL MAKE A THICK, TART DRINK THAT
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
DR. HOFFMAN IS RIGHT ABOUT RHUBARB. IT CONTAINS A NATURAL LAXATIVE CHEMICAL THAT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THAT IN CASCARA SAGRADA AND SENNA. IT'S ALSO
HIGH IN FIBER. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT ITS LAXATIVE ACTION CAN BE PRETTY POWERFUL; YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY SOME OTHER METHODS FIRST.
LEAFLETS AND SEED PODS OF SENNA ARE
USED TO MAKE A POWERFUL LAXATIVE.
C ORNS
I
T'S STRANGE, THIS THING CALLED HEREDITY. MY FATHER WAS ALWAYS BOTHERED BY
CORNS, BUT I'VE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE. THEN AGAIN, MAYBE LIFESTYLE
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS CASE. DAD NEVER WENT BAREFOOT; I ALWAYS DID.
CORNS ARE HARDENED, MOUND-SHAPED AREAS OF INCREASED GROWTH ON THE SKIN OF
THE TOES. HARD CORNS OCCUR ON THE TOES, WHILE SOFT CORNS ARISE BETWEEN THE TOES.
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH CORNS IS TO PREVENT THEM FROM FORMING IN THE FIRST
143
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
PLACE. ALMOST ALWAYS, THEY'RE CAUSED BY SHOES THAT FIT TOO TIGHTLY, BUNCHING UP
THE TOES AND IRRITATING THE SKIN. MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WOMEN, WEAR SHOES
THAT ARE TOO SMALL FOR THEM IN THE BELIEF THAT SMALL FEET MAKE THEM APPEAR DAINTIER. BUT IN MY OPINION, THE PAIN JUST ISN'T WORTH IT. (PERSONALLY, FD RATHER BE
WITH A HAPPY, HEALTHY WOMAN IN SHOES THAT FIT HER THAN WITH A WOMAN WHO CRIPPLES HERSELF IN THE NAME OF DAINTINESS.)
CELANDINE COM REMOVER
HERE'S A GENTLE HERBAL REMEDY THAT YOU
CAN MAKE YOURSELF FOR SOFTENING AND REMOVING CORNS. THE HERB CELANDINE HAS A
WORLDWIDE REPUTATION AS A CORN REMOVER.
6 CITPS WATER
1 TEASPOON POTASSIUM CHLORIDE
4 OUNCES FRESH CELANDINE, CHOPPED
1 CUP GLYCERIN
PUT THE WATER IN A MEDIUM SAUCEPAN AND
ADD THE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE. HEAT AND STIR
UNTIL THE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE DISSOLVES.
REMOVE FROM THE HEAT, ADD THE CELANDINE
AND LET STAND FOR 2 HOURS.
RETURN THE PAN TO THE HEAT AND BRING THE
MIXTURE TO A BOIL. REDUCE THE HEAT AND
SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES.
USING A SIEVE OR WIRE STRAINER, STRAIN THE
LIQUID INTO A MEDIUM BOWL. DISCARD THE
PLANT MATERIAL.
RETURN THE LIQUID TO THE PAN AND LET IT
SIMMER UNTIL IT IS REDUCED TO 1½ CUPS.
ADD THE GLYCERIN AND CONTINUE SIMMERING
UNTIL THE LIQUID IS REDUCED TO 2 CUPS.
STRAIN THE LIQUID, PLACE IT IN A BOTTLE AND
STORE IT IN COOL PLACE. APPLY IT TO CORNS
TWICE A DAY—FOR EXAMPLE, BEFORE YOU
LEAVE FOR WORK AND BEFORE YOU GO TO BED.
NOTE: POTASSIUM CHLORIDE IS AVAILABLE AT SUPERMARKETS AS A COMMERCIAL SALT SUBSTITUTE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CORNS
IF YOU CAN'T PREVENT CORNS, THEN
FD SUGGEST SOME HERBAL TREATMENTS
THAT SHOULD HELP.
V CELANDINE (CHELIDONIUM
MAJUS). EVERYWHERE I GO, FROM CONNECTICUT TO CHINA, HERBALISTS I RESPECT
TELL ME ABOUT USING CELANDINE TO TREAT
CORNS. I CONFESS THAT I HAVE NOT YET TRIED
IT, BUT IF I EVER GET A COM, I PLAN TO. IN
FACT, I'VE GOT THE FORMULA ALL READY FOR A
CELANDINE CORN REMOVER.
V FIG (FICUS CARICA)*, PAPAYA
(CARICA PAPAYA) AND PINEAPPLE
(ANANAS COMOSUS). WHEN KING
SOLOMON DEVELOPED BOILS, HIS PHYSICIANS APPLIED FIGS; THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY
FEW DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MEDICINAL USE OF
HERBS IN THE BIBLE. FIGS CONTAIN
PROTEIN-DISSOLVING ENZYMES THAT HELP
DISSOLVE UNWANTED SKIN GROWTHS, INCLUDING CORNS. PAPAYA AND PINEAPPLE
CONTAIN SIMILAR ENZYMES, AND ALL THREE
FRUITS HAVE AGE-OLD REPUTATIONS FOR REDUCING CORNS AND WARTS.
HERE'S A RECIPE CULLED FROM MY
DATABASE THAT I MIGHT TRY IF I EVER
ABANDONED MY BAREFOOT WAYS AND GOT
A CORN. OPEN A FRESH FIG AND TAPE THE
PULP TO THE CORN OVERNIGHT. OR CUT A
SQUARE OF PINEAPPLE PEEL AND TAPE THE
INNER SIDE TO THE CORN OVERNIGHT. THE
144
COUGHING
FOLLOWING MORNING, REMOVE THE HERB AND SOAK THE FOOT IN HOT WATER. AFTER AN
HOUR OR SO, TRY TO REMOVE THE CORN. IT SHOULD COME OFF FAIRLY EASILY, BUT YOU CAN
RUB IT GENTLY WITH A PUMICE STONE IF NECESSARY.
"SOME STUBBORN CASES, HOWEVER, MAY REQUIRE FOUR TO FIVE OVERNIGHT TREATMENTS," WARNS MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMAN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS. FOLKLORE ATTESTS TO SOMFAIRLY SIMILAR PROCEDURES USING PAPAYA.
V WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW CONTAINS ASPIRIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SALICYLATES THAT RELIEVE PAIN. BUT SALICYLATES ARE ALSO POWERFUL
ACIDS THAT CAN HELP DISSOLVE CORNS AND WARTS. JUST USE THIS HERB CAREFULLY, PLACING
WILLOW BARK POULTICES DIRECTLY ON THE CORN ITSELF; DON'T LET THE HERB COME IN CONTACT WITH THE SURROUNDING SKIN. BECAUSE THEY'RE ACIDIC, SALICYLATES MAY CAUSE SKIN
INFLAMMATION.
V WINTERGREEN (GAIDTHERIA PROCUMBENS). THIS IS ANOTHER GOOD SOURCE
OF SALICYLATES. SOME HERBALISTS RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPLY WINTERGREEN OIL TO
REMOVE CALLUSES, CORNS, CYSTS AND WARTS. I'D PROBABLY TRY IT FOR CORNS, BOTH TO
DISSOLVE HARDENED SKIN AND TO RELIEVE PAIN. AGAIN, TO MAKE SURE YOU AVOID IRRITATION, APPLY THE OIL ONLY TO THE CORN ITSELF AND NOT TO THE SURROUNDING SKIN.
REMEMBER, THOUGH, TO KEEP WINTERGREEN OIL (OR ANY PRODUCT CONTAINING IT)
OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. THE MINTY SMELL CAN BE VERY TEMPTING, BUT INGESTING EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS CAN PROVE FATAL TO YOUNG CHILDREN.
COUGHING
T
HE COMMON COUGH IS PERHAPS MORE COMMON THAN THE COMMON COLD.
ROUGHLY HALF OF THE PEOPLE SEEKING MEDICAL CARE IN WINTER SUFFER FROM
INFLAMMATION OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT, WITH COUGH AND OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS.
NO MATTER WHAT THE CAUSE, COUGHING IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME—PRODUCTIVE
COUGHS BRING UP MUCUS, WHILE NONPRODUCTIVE OR DRY, HACKING COUGHS DO NOT.
REMEMBER, IF YOU HAVE A COUGH THAT JUST WON'T GO AWAY, IT MEANS THAT YOUR
BODY IS SENDING YOU SOME KIND OF MESSAGE. IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS
"STOP SMOKING" OR "GET THAT SINUS INFECTION CLEARED UP." WHILE YOU'RE TREATING
YOUR COUGH, YOU ALSO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR BODY IS TRYING TO TELL
YOU. IF HOME REMEDIES DON'T SEEM TO HELP AND YOUR COUGH PERSISTS FOR SEVERAL
DAYS, SEE YOUR DOCTOR.
I 145
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
GREEN PHARMACY FOR COUGHING
REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, HOWEVER, HERBS CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. HERBAL
COUGH TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. HERE ARE SOME
THAT PD RECOMMEND.
VV COLTSFOOT (TUSSILAGO FARFARA). CHRISTOPHER HOBBS, A FOURTH-GENERATION CALIFORNIA HERBALIST AND AUTHOR OF SEVERAL FINE BOOKS ON HERBAL MEDICINES,
SUGGESTS A TEA MADE WITH FOUR PARTS COLTSFOOT, FOUR PARTS PLANTAIN, ONE PART LICORICE,
ONE PART MARSH MALLOW AND TWO PARTS THYME, PLUS A LITTLE OF THE IMMUNE-BOOSTING
HERB ECHINACEA. SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER TO ME.
COLTSFOOT HAS BEEN USED AS A COUGH REMEDY SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. IN FACT, ITS
GENERIC NAME, TUSSILAGO, COMES FROM THE LATIN FOR "COUGH." BUT COLTSFOOT, LIKE
SEVERAL OTHER HERBS, CONTAINS CHEMICALS CALLED PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS (PAS). AT
HIGH DOSES, THESE CHEMICALS CAN DAMAGE THE LIVER, AND LONG-TERRA USE CAN CONCEIVABLY LEAD TO LIVER CANCER. AS A RESULT, SOME HERBALISTS HAVE GONE ON RECORD
AS SAYING THAT HERBS LIKE COLTSFOOT THAT CONTAIN PAS SHOULD NEVER BE INGESTED.
BUT COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERB SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, ENDORSES USING UP TO THREE TEASPOONS
OF COLTSFOOT A DAY TO MAKE A TEA TO TREAT A COUGH. AT THAT DOSE, YOU WON'T CONSUME MORE THAN TEN MILLIGRAMS OF PAS, A LEVEL THAT THE GROUP SEES AS SAFE FOR
OCCASIONAL USE AS A COUGH TREATMENT.
PERSONALLY, I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH A LITDE COLTSFOOT NOW AND THEN. I USE IT
MYSELF FROM TIME TO TIME. IT SOOTHES THE THROAT, REDUCING THE URGE TO COUGH. BUT
DON'T USE THIS HERB IF YOU TAKE A LOT OF MEDICATIONS, BECAUSE YOU'LL STRESS YOUR
LIVER AS YOU'RE CLEARING MEDICATIONS FROM THE BODY. AND DON'T USE IT IF YOU HAVE
A HISTORY OF LIVER DISEASE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.
W ELDERBERRY (SAMBUCUS NIGRA). ISRAELI SCIENTISTS PRAISE ELDERBERRY FOR
TREATING COLDS, COUGH AND FEVER. AN ISRAELI STUDY SHOWED THAT A DRUG (SAMBUCOL,
WHICH IS NOW AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES) MADE FROM ELDERBERRY IS EFFECTIVE
AGAINST FLU, INCLUDING THE COUGH THAT GOES WITH IT. YOU CAN ALSO PURCHASE AN ELDERBERRY TINCTURE OR USE THE DRIED HERB TO MAKE A TEA. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE
AMERICAN ELDERBERRY INSTEAD.
^¼. GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). SEVERAL CHEMICALS IN GINGER (GINGEROLS
AND SHOGAOLS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN STUDIES USING LABORATORY ANIMALS TO HAVE COUGHSUPPRESSING, PAIN-RELIEVING AND FEVER-REDUCING ACTION. SIMILAR EFFECTS IN HUMANS
HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED, BUT I BELIEVE THAT GINGER CAN HELP RELIEVE A COUGH.
YOU CAN TRY ADDING IT TO WHATEVER YOU TAKE FOR COUGHS.
W LEMON (CITRUS LIMON)* HERE'S ANOTHER CHRIS HOBBS COUGH FORMULA:
STEEP 2 TEASPOONS OF ORGANIC LEMON RINDS, 1 TEASPOON OF SAGE AND '/£ TEASPOON OF
146
COUGHIN G
THYME IN BOILING WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. THEN ADD THE JUICE OF
 LA LEMON AND 1 TABLESPOON OF HONEY. I'M QUITE PARTIAL TO LEMONADE, AND I THINK THIS REMEDY IS DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING. IN FACT, DRINK IT TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY. (HOBBS CALLS FOR
ORGANIC RINDS BECAUSE IT IS JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE TO WASH AWAY THE PESTICIDES THAT
ARE COMMONLY USED ON CITRUS FRUITS.)
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHISA GLABRA). AMONG ITS MANY BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES, LICORICE SOOTHES MUCOUS MEMBRANES AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE FOR COUGHS
AND ASTHMA. YOU MIGHT TRY LICORICE TEA (MADE WITH ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED ROOT PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER) OR ADD SOME LICORICE ROOT TO OTHER HERBAL COUGH FORMULAS.
LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—
UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF
LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION,
EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
W SLIPPERY ELM (ULMUS RUBRA). THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS
DECLARED SLIPPERY ELM A SAFE, EFFECTIVE COUGH SOOTHER. THE BARK CONTAINS LARGE
QUANTITIES OF A MUCILAGE THAT ACTS AS AN EFFECTIVE THROAT SOOTHER AND COUGH SUPPRESSANT. YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIALLY PREPARED THROAT LOZENGES CONTAINING SLIPPERY
ELM, OR YOU CAN USE THE DRIED HERB TO MAKE A TEA.
V ANISE (PIMPINEUA ANISUM). COMMISSION E ENDORSES ANISEED AS AN EXPECTORANT FOR REMOVING PHLEGM IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND AS A COUGH SUPPRESSANT.
YOU COULD TRY A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED ANISEED PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES, THEN STRAIN. SUGGESTED DOSE:
ONE CUP, MORNING AND EVENING.
V BURNET-SAXIFRAGE (PIMPINEUA MAJOR). COMMISSION E APPROVES
BURNET-SAXIFRAGE ROOT (THREE TO SIX TEASPOONS) FOR AILMENTS OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY
TRACT. STUDIES SHOW THAT IT HAS THE PROPERTIES OF AN EXPECTORANT AND COUGH SUPPRESSANT. IT IS WIDELY USED TO TREAT BRONCHITIS, HOARSENESS AND SORE THROAT.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). I FIND MARSH MALLOW'S SOOTHING
ROOTS AND EXTRACTS, WHICH ALSO CONTAIN MUCILAGE, QUITE USEFUL FOR RELIEVING COUGH
AND SORE THROAT. COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS MARSH MALLOW ROOT FOR TREATING IRRITATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF THE THROAT AND ANY ASSOCIATED DRY COUGH. YOU
CAN MAKE A TEA WITH TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V MULLEIN (VERBASCUM THAPSUS). LIKE MARSH MALLOW, MULLEIN CONTAINS
THROAT-SOOTHING MUCILAGE. IT ALSO HAS CHEMICALS CALLED SAPONINS THAT HAVE AN
EXPECTORANT EFFECT. COMMISSION E APPROVES MULLEIN FLOWERS FOR TREATING COUGHS.
MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HAVE USED MULLEIN LEAVES TO TREAT COUGH, AND I THINK
OF IT AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. I'D SUGGEST STRAINING THE TEA TO REMOVE THE HAIRS,
WHICH CAN BE IRRITATING, AND ADDING LEMON, HONEY AND OTHER HERBS TO MASK THE
BITTER TASTE.
14.7
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V PRIMROSE {PRIMULA VERIS). COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS OF DRIED PRIMROSE FLOWERS TO MAKE A CUP OF TEA FOR RELIEVING COUGHS.
NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR PRIMROSE, NOT EVENING
PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS).
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). TEA MADE FROM THIS HERB IS AN OLD
STANDBY FOR COUGHS. NETTLE ALSO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE AS A TREATMENT FOR COLDS,
WHOOPING COUGH (PERTUSSIS) AND TUBERCULOSIS. IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH TRYING. I'D SUGGEST A TEA MADE FROM THE LEAVES FOR COUGHS AND HAY FEVER.
V SUNDEW (DROSERA, VARIOUS SPECIES). HERE'S ANOTHER HERB WITH THE
COMMISSION E SEAL OF APPROVAL. YOU CAN TRY MAKING A TEA WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. DRINK ONCE A DAY.
SUNDEW HAS BEEN USED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS TO TREAT BRONCHITIS, COUGH,
WHOOPING COUGH AND ESPECIALLY DRY, IRRITATING COUGHS IN CHILDREN. MODERN RESEARCH HAS VALIDATED THESE USES, SHOWING THAT THIS HERB HAS EXPECTORANT,
COUGH-SUPPRESSING AND BRONCHIAL-SOOTHING PROPERTIES.
CUTS, SCRAPES
AND ABSCESSES
I
HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE AN ABSCESS LIKE THE ONE I HAD ON MY LEFT LEG 30
YEARS AGO IN THE RAIN FOREST OF PANAMA. IN THE JUNGLE, MINOR CUTS SEEM
TO TURN INTO MAJOR INFECTIONS ALMOST OVERNIGHT. THIS ONE STARTED OUT AS A LITTLE
NICK ABOVE MY LEFT ANKLE. ALMOST BEFORE YOU COULD SAY "SUPPURATING"—THE
MEDICAL TERM FOR THE OOZING PUS PRODUCED BY INFECTED WOUNDS—MY ABSCESS
TURNED INTO A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT HOLLYWOOD MOVIES ABOUT THE TROPICS USED
TO CALL JUNGLE ROT.
MY LOWER LEG WAS A PAINFUL MESS, WITH AN ANGRY, SPREADING WOUND DRIPPING
DISGUSTING GREEN PUS, THE VISCOUS DEBRIS OF MY IMMUNE SYSTEM'S FIGHT AGAINST
THE BACTERIA THAT HAD TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN MY CALF.
IN THE SLEEPY LITTLE PROVINCE OF DARIEN NEAR THE COLOMBIAN BORDER, WHERE
MY CUT TURNED INTO AN ABSCESS, MY PANAMANIAN FRIENDS SHOOK THEIR HEADS
KNOWINGLY. THEY SAID MY INFECTION HAD BEEN CAUSED BY TOO CLOSE AN ENCOUNTER
WITH TROPICAL DUMBCANE (DIEFFENBAEHIA SEGUINE), WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE FAMILIAR PALMLIKE DIEFFENBACHIA HOUSEPLANT. MY FRIENDS ASSUMED THAT SOME OF
148
CUTS , SCRAPE S AND ABSCESSES
THE CAUSTIC RESIN FROM CUT STEMS OF DUMBCANE HAD ENTERED A MINOR CUT. THAT
SOUNDED POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY SINCE I TENDED TO GO BAREFOOT ON THE SLIPPERY
SLOPES OF THE RIVERS, TRYING NOT TO EMBARRASS MYSELF BY FALLING DOWN. BUT FLL
NEVER KNOW FOR SURE. ALL I KNEW WAS THAT AS THE ULCER GREW LARGER, I BECAME
FEVERISH—AND SCARED.
I PUT ON A BRAVE FACE, BUT SKIN INFECTIONS IN THE TROPICS CAN QUICKLY BECOME SERIOUS. THREE DECADES AGO, I WAS NOT QUITE AS CONFIDENT OF THE GREEN
PHARMACY AS I AM TODAY. I FIGURED I SHOULD SEE AN AMERICAN PHYSICIAN AT A HOSPITAL IN THE CANAL ZONE.
THE DOCTOR CONFIRMED MY WORST FEARS. AFTER ONE LOOK AT MY ABSCESS, HE SAID
THAT IF I DIDN'T GET INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS IMMEDIATELY, I MIGHT LOSE MY LEG. HE
GAVE ME SOME ANTIBIOTICS, BUT EVEN THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH, IN HIS VIEW. IF I
WANTED TO SAVE THE LEG, HE SAID, I SHOULD RETURN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR CONTINUED TREATMENT.
TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MY DECISION, THAT WAS JUST THE TIME WHEN THE AMERICAN MILITARY OFFERED ME A KING'S RANSOM TO RETURN TO THE RAIN FOREST AS A BOTANICAL CONSULTANT. WHAT TO DO? I WANTED THAT JOB MORE THAN ANYTHING. BUT I ALSO
WANTED TO KEEP MY LEG.
TRUSTING BUSN MEDICINE
I CALLED MY FRIEND NARCISO "CHICHO" BRISTAN, AN AFRICAN-PANAMANIAN WHO
HAD ACCOMPANIED ME ON SEVERAL JUNGLE TRIPS. HE, TOO, WOULD ENJOY A FINANCIAL
WINDFALL BY JOINING THE NEW EXPEDITION INTO THE BUSH.
CHICHO TOOK ME HOBBLING TO SEE HIS SISTER, CARMEN, A DARIEN NURSE WITH AN
EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF BUSH MEDICINE. SHE HAD SEEN ULCERS LIKE MINE BEFORE.
YES, I NEEDED IMMEDIATE TREATMENT, BUT NO, I DIDN'T NEED TO BE HOSPITALIZED OR
RECEIVE INTRAVENOUS ANTIBIOTICS.
CARMEN SAID I COULD TREAT MY ABSCESS WITH "FLOWERS," BUT NOT THE BOTANICAL KIND. SHE MEANT FLOWERS (PURIFIED POWDER) OF SULFUR. SHE RECOMMENDED
FLUSHING OUT MY INTERCONNECTED SORES WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, A GOOD DISINFECTANT, DRYING THEM IN THE SUN AND FINALLY SPRINKLING ON FLOWERS OF SULFUR.
I DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE ON BUSH MEDICINE. SOON AFTER THAT VISIT, I
LIMPED BACK INTO THE JUNGLE, STILL LEANING ON CHICHO. BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAN
ON HIM FOR LONG. CARMEN'S PROGRAM AND HER FLOWERS OF SULFUR QUICKLY HEALED
THAT ANGRY ABSCESS. WITHIN A MONTH, ALL I HAD LEFT WAS A SCAR THAT I BEAR TO THIS
DAY, TESTIMONY TO MY FIRST LEG-THREATENING ENCOUNTER WITH JUNGLE ROT.
TODAY, CHICHO IS THE WATCHMAN IN DARIEN'S CERRO PIRRE NATIONAL FOREST,
MY FAVORITE CENTRAL AMERICAN RAIN FOREST PRESERVE. AND THANKS IN PART TO MY
149
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
EXPERIENCE IN TREATING THAT ABSCESS WITH BUSH MEDICINE, I WAS ABLE TO PERFORM
A 30-YEAR STINT AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S EXPERT ON HERBAL
MEDICINE.
I'VE SPENT 5 OF THE LAST 30 YEARS TROMPING AROUND THE TROPICS LOOKING FOR
MEDICINAL PLANTS. AND WHILE I'VE FOUND QUITE A FEW, I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE TO VENTURE OFF INTO THE PANAMANIAN RAIN FOREST TO FIND EFFECTIVE MEDICINAL HERBS. SOME ARE MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. MANY OF OUR BEST MEDICINES ARE
RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN BACKYARDS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR CUTS, SCRAPES ANA ABSCESSES
EVERYONE DEVELOPS SKIN INFECTIONS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER AT SOME POINT IN
LIFE. CHANCES ARE THAT YOURS WON'T BECOME AS SERIOUS AS MINE DID, BUT IF A CUT
BECOMES MORE RED, TENDER OR PAINFUL AFTER A DAY OR TWO OR STARTS OOZING FLUID, IT
MEANS THAT YOU HAVE AN INFECTION THAT SHOULD BE TREATED BY A DOCTOR.
HERE ARE SEVERAL HERBS THAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING MINOR CUTS. IF
YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THEM ON MORE SERIOUS CUTS AND ABSCESSES (THEY DO WORK),
PLEASE DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE DOING SO.
VVV TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). TEATREE OIL WAS USED BY
AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES AND EARLY SETTLERS TO TREAT ABRASIONS, ATHLETE'S FOOT, BUG
BITES, BURNS AND CUTS. ITS USE AS A WOUND TREATMENT HAS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD.
THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR THIS, AS IT CONTAINS THE POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC COMPOUND
TERPINEN-4-OL.
VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, RECOMMENDS TEATREE OIL AS A WOUND TREATMENT.
I HAVE PERSONALLY USED TEATREE OIL AS AN EXTERNALLY APPLIED ANTISEPTIC FOR
ABSCESSES, AND I CAN ATTEST TO ITS VALUE. IT IS WELL-PROVEN AS AN ANTISEPTIC
AGAINST BACTERIA AND FUNGI. IN FACT, TEATREE OIL IS JUST AS GOOD AS ANY OF THOSE
NONHERBAL ANTISEPTICS MOTHER USED TO USE—IODINE AND MERCUROCHROME.
PEOPLE WHO ARE SENSITIVE TO IT MAY FIND THAT THE PURE OIL IRRITATES THEIR SKIN.
I SUGGEST DILUTING IT BY PUTTING SEVERAL DROPS IN A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF ANY
VEGETABLE OIL. IF YOU FIND THAT THE OIL IRRITATES YOUR SKIN, DILUTE IT FURTHER OR DISCONTINUE USE. AND DON'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL OILS, INTERNALLY. THEY
ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MANY OF THEM CAN BE
POISONOUS.
W CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). COMMISSION E, THE EXPERT COMMITTEE OF GERMAN MEDICINAL HERB EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT,
ENDORSES CALENDULA FOR REDUCING INFLAMMATION AND PROMOTING WOUND HEALING. IT
DOES BOTH.
150
CUTS , SCRAPE S AN D ABSCESSE S
TO MAKE A WASH TO TREAT CUTS,
POUR A CUP OF BOILING WATER OVER A
TEASPOON OF DRY PETALS AND STEEP FOR
TEN MINUTES. THEN SOAK A CLEAN
CLOTH IN THE LIQUID AND APPLY IT AS A
COMPRESS ON THE WOUND.
CALENDULA MAY BE EVEN MORE
EFFECTIVE IN CREAMS. YOU CAN BUY
COMMERCIAL SKIN TREATMENT PRODUCTS
CONTAINING CALENDULA IN MANY
HEALTH FOOD STORES.
VV COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM
OFFICINALE). THIS HERB CONTAINS A
COMPOUND, ALLANTOIN, THAT HELPS HEAL
WOUNDS. ITS ASTRINGENT TANNIC ACIDS
MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO WOUND
HEALING.
COMFREY HAS GOTTEN SOME BAD
PRESS RECENTLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS
CHEMICALS CALLED PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS, WHICH CAN DAMAGE THE LIVER.
MANY AUTHORITIES WARN AGAINST INGESTING IT. BUT MERE'S LITTLE IF ANY RISK
IN APPLYING COMFREY EXTERNALLY. IT'S
STILL MY FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST
SORES THAT ARE SLOW TO HEAL. TO USE IT,
YOU CAN TAKE SOME FRESH LEAVES AND
RUB THEM DIRECTLY ON THE AFFECTED
AREA. YOU CAN ALSO FIND COMMERCIAL
SKIN-CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING COMFREY IN MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES.
W ECHINACE A (ECHINACEA,
VARIOUS SPECIES). ECHINACEA HAS
POTENT IMMUNE-STIMULATING PROPERTIES THAT HELP THE BODY HEAL WOUNDS. COMMISSION E APPROVES APPLYING ECHINACEA PREPARATIONS EXTERNALLY TO TREAT SUPERFICIAL WOUNDS.
I THINK OF THIS HERB AS ONLY A MILD ANTISEPTIC WHEN IT'S APPLIED EXTERNALLY. IF
I HAD AN INFECTED CUT, I'D TAKE SOME TINCTURE OR DRINK ECHINACEA TEA TO
STRENGTHEN MY IMMUNE SYSTEM SO MY BODY COULD HEAL THE INFECTION. (ALTHOUGH
BLISTORINE ALL-PURPOSE
HERBAL ANTISEPTIC
I CALL THIS RECIPE BLISTERINE BECAUSE I'VE
USED IT TO PREVENT AND TREAT INFECTIONS IN
POPPED BLISTERS. BUT YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF
IT AS BETTER THAN LISTERINE, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS.
I BEGIN WITH A HANDFUL OF FRESH THYME
OR HORSEBALM BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN THE
COMPOUND THYMOL, THE VERY SAME ACTIVE
INGREDIENT FOUND IN THE COMMERCIAL
MOUTHWASH LISTERINE. THEN I ADD HANDFULS OF OTHER PLANTS THAT CONTAIN POTENT
HERBAL ANTISEPTICS: EUCALYPTUS OR ROSEMARY, WHICH CONTAIN CINEOLE; ONE OF THE
MANY MINTS THAT CONTAIN MENTHOL; AND
CHERRY BIRCH OR WINTERGREEN, WHICH CONTAIN THE ASPIRIN-LIKE COMPOUND METHYLSALICYLATE. (THESE ARE ONLY THE MAIN
ANTISEPTIC CHEMICALS. EACH PLANT ACTUALLY
CONTAINS MORE THAN 20.)
CRUSH THE HERBS, PUT THEM ALL IN A
GLASS JAR AND COVER THEM WITH VODKA.
AFTER A FEW DAYS, STRAIN OUT THE PLANT MATERIAL AND KEEP THE LIQUID IN YOUR MEDICINE CHEST OR FIRST-AID KIT TO USE ON CUTS
AND SCRAPES. IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY MISTAKE
THIS LIQUID FOR YOUR AFTER-DINNER BRANDY,
NEVER FEAR. NOT ONLY WILL IT NOT HURT YOU,
IT ACTUALLY TASTES PRETTY GOOD. (TAKE
ALL THINGS, HOWEVER, INCLUDING HERBAL
LIQUEURS, IN MODERATION.)

CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS
HARMLESS.)
V*> GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). LIKE SEVERAL OTHER YELLOW-ROOTED
SPECIES—BARBERRY, GOLDTHREAD, OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT—GOLDENSEAL CONTAINS SEVERAL ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS, NOTABLY BERBERINE AND HYDRASTINE. I WOULD
NOT HESITATE TO APPLY A POULTICE OF CRUSHED GOLDENSEAL ROOT IF I GOT CUT IN THE FOREST
AND DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER ANTISEPTICS HANDY.
VV GOTU KOLA (CENTEUA ASIATICA). GOTU KOLA CONTAINS ASIATIC ACID, A
COMPOUND THAT SPURS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT MUST FORM IN
ORDER FOR WOUNDS TO HEAL. IN CLINICAL TRIALS, EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS OF GOTU KOLA EXTRACT HAVE PROVEN USEFUL IN TREATING WOUNDS, SKIN GRAFTS, SURGICAL INCISIONS AND
EVEN GANGRENE.
VV HORSEBALM (MONARDA PUNCTATA). SINCE I HAVE HORSEBALM GROWING
IN MY BACKYARD IN MARYLAND, I SIMPLY MAKE A WOUND-HEALING TINCTURE BY FILLING
A GLASS WITH THE CRUSHED LEAVES AND COVERING THEM WITH CHEAP VODKA. COLD ALCOHOL
SEEMS TO CAPTURE MORE OF THE ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS FOUND IN THIS PLANT THAN DOES
WARM ALCOHOL. I LET IT STEEP FOR A FEW DAYS. THEN THE LIQUID CAN BE APPLIED TO CUTS
AS AN ANTISEPTIC WASH.
IF YOU DECIDE TO TRY THIS HERB, FEEL FREE TO SOAK BANDAGES IN THE TINCTURE AND
LAY THE WET DRESSING DIRECTLY ON TOP OF INFECTED WOUNDS. THEN COVER THE WET
DRESSING WITH A CLEAN, DRY BANDAGE. CHANGE THE DRESSING EVERY FEW HOURS AS IT
DRIES. YOU CAN ALSO APPLY TINCTURE-SOAKED WET DRESSINGS TO CUTS THAT ARE NOT INFECTED TO KEEP THEM INFECTION-FREE AND HELP SPEED THEIR HEALING.
YOU CAN USE THIS SAME GENERAL RECIPE TO MAKE TINCTURES OF THE OTHER HERBS
LISTED IN THIS CHAPTER.
V ALOE (ALOE VERA). WHILE I AM QUICK TO USE ALOE FOR BURNS, I'M NOT SO
SURE I WANT TO USE IT FOR WOUNDS THAT ARE MUCH MORE THAN A SCRAPE OR SCRATCH.
STUDIES SHOW THAT IT HAS LITTLE BENEFIT IN TREATING DEEP, INCISION-TYPE WOUNDS. IT
HAS PROVED USEFUL FOR TREATING SUPERFICIAL CUTS, HOWEVER.
V ARNICA (ARNICA MONTANA). THIS HERB, ALSO KNOWN AS MOUNTAIN DAISY,
IS USEFUL FOR TREATING AND DISINFECTING CUTS AND OTHER TYPES OF WOUNDS, ACCORDING TO
NORMAN G. BISSET, PH.D., PROFESSOR OF PHARMACY AT KING'S COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND AUTHOR OF THE EXCELLENT BOOK, HERBAL DRUGS AND PHYTOPHARMACEUTICALS.
COMMISSION E AGREES, APPROVING EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF ARNICA FLOWERS AS
A QUICK FIX FOR WOUNDS, BRUISES, DISLOCATIONS AND SPRAINS. SUGGESTED DOSAGE:
FOR A COMPRESS, USE ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP UNTIL
COOL. SOAK A CLEAN CLOTH IN IT AND APPLY.
V CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATIC UM). THE DRIED FLOWER BUDS OF THIS TROP152
DANDRUF F
ICAL TREE CAN BE FOUND ON YOUR SPICE RACK, AND OIL OF CLOVE IS A STAPLE IN AROMATHERAPY AND IN DENTISTS' OFFICES. THAT'S BECAUSE CLOVE OIL IS RICH IN EUGENOL, A
CHEMICAL THAT SERVES DOUBLE DUTY AS BOTH AN ANTISEPTIC AND A PAINKILLER. YOU CAN
SPRINKLE POWDERED CLOVES ON A CUT TO KEEP IT FROM BECOMING INFECTED.
V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). ONCE WHEN I HAD AN INFECTED EARLOBE AND NO
ACCESS TO A DOCTOR, I APPLIED GARLIC, TAPING A CUT CLOVE DIRECDY OVER THE AFFECTED
AREA. IT LOOKED A LITTLE SILLY, BUT THE TREATMENT WORKED. GARLIC REDUCED THE INFECTION AND ACCOMPANYING SWELLING.
APPLYING GARLIC TO THE SKIN CAN CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION IN SOME PEOPLE, BUT
GARLIC IS ONE FINE ANTIBIOTIC. IF YOU OPT FOR THIS TREATMENT AND IT IRRITATES YOUR
SKIN, HOWEVER, DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
GARLIC IS NOT THE ONLY HERBAL ANTIBIOTIC. ITS CLOSE RELATIVES, ONION AND
CHIVES, ARE ALSO LOADED WITH ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). POULTICES OF MARSH MALLOW HAVE
BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO TREAT WOUNDS. THE HERB'S ROOT CONTAINS A SOLUBLE FIBER (MUCILAGE) THAT EXPANDS INTO A SPONGY, SOOTHING GEL IN WATER. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH A TRY.
V MELILOT (MELILOTUS OFFICINALIS). EXPERIMENTS USING LABORATORY ANIMALS
HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS HERB ACCELERATES WOUND HEALING. THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENT APPEARS TO BE THE COMPOUND COUMARIN. IN GERMANY, POWDERED MELILOT IS MIXED WITH
AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF WATER TO MAKE A POULTICE FOR TREATING HEMORRHOIDS. IT SEEMS
REASONABLE TO ME TO TRY THIS POULTICE TO TREAT MINOR CUTS AND WOUNDS.
V HONEY. WHILE NOT EXACTLY AN HERB, HONEY IS MADE FROM FLOWERS, AND I
THINK THIS TREATMENT DESERVES A MENTION. IN MANY FOLK MEDICINE TRADITIONS AROUND
THE WORLD, HONEY IS DABBED ON WOUNDS BECAUSE IT DRIES TO FORM A NATURAL BANDAGE.
ACTUALLY, MEDICAL SCIENCE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT HONEY DOES EVEN MORE.
SEVERAL STUDIES OF SURGICAL WOUNDS SHOW THAT HONEY ACCELERATES HEALING. I'VE
NEVER USED IT MYSELF, BUT I'VE SEEN INDIANS IN PANAMA AND PERU USE IT QUITE
SUCCESSFULLY.
DANDRUIR
I
'VE RARELY BEEN BOTHERED BY DANDRUFF. AND ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BE SURE, I
THINK I KNOW WHY—IT'S ALL THE BIOTIN I EAT.
BIOTIN, AN IMPORTANT VITAMIN-LIKE NUTRIENT THAT THE BODY USES IN MANY
153
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WAYS, SHOWS UP IN MY DATABASE AS A MAJOR ANTI-DANDRUFF COMPOUND. NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND GETTING SIX MILLIGRAMS A DAY FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT
OF BOTH DANDRUFF AND THE RELATED CONDITION SEBORRHEA.
MY DATABASE TELLS ME THAT SOYBEANS ARE VERY HIGH IN BIOTIN (750 PARTS PER
MILLION). THAT MEANS I'D NEED ONLY A HANDFUL TO PROVIDE THE SIX MILLIGRAMS I'D
NEED TO SAVE MY SCALP FROM DANDRUFF AND SEBORRHEA. I HAVE OFTEN EATEN THAT
MANY SOYBEANS AS I WANDERED THROUGH THE SOYBEAN FIELDS AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH STATION IN BELTSVILLE, MARYLAND,
WHERE I'VE SPENT THE LAST 30 YEARS TRYING TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE HEALING
POWERS OF PLANTS.
THEN AGAIN, MAYBE I'M DANDRUFF-FREE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF BIOTIN BUT ALSO
DUE TO THE BREAKFASTS I EAT. I TEND TO BEGIN MY MORNINGS WITH THINGS LIKE A SANDWICH MADE WITH BRAZIL NUT BUTTER AND COLESLAW WITH TOMATOES, WASHED DOWN
WITH VEGETABLE JUICE. MY BREAKFASTS CONTAIN A LOT OF OTHER ANTI-DANDRUFF INGREDIENTS: SELENIUM, SULFUR, LECITHIN AND ZINC IN THE BRAZIL NUT BUTTER, CITRIC ACID IN
THE VEGETABLE JUICE AND RED PEPPER IN THE SLAW.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DANDRUFF
DANDRUFF IS A COMMON SCALP CONDITION THAT CAUSES UNSIGHTLY WHITE FLAKES TO
APPEAR IN THE SCALP AND HAIR. THE WHITE FLAKES ARE DEAD SCALP SKIN. DANDRUFF
IS OFTEN THE RESULT OF SEBORRHEA, AN INFLAMMATION (DERMATITIS) OF THE SCALP. HERE
ARE SOME HERBS YOU MIGHT TRY FOR PREVENTING AND TREATING DANDRUFF.
W V SOYBEAN {GLYCINE MAX) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING BIOTIN.
WHILE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME BIOTIN IN JUST ABOUT ALL PLANTS, MY DATABASE REVEALS
SOME STANDOUTS. SOYBEANS HAVE THE MOST, FOLLOWED BY GARLIC, AMERICAN GINSENG,
OATS, BARLEY, ASIAN GINSENG, AVOCADO, COTTONSEED, ALFALFA, SESAME, CORN, FAVA BEANS
AND ELDERBERRY.
LAMENTABLY, MY DATABASE CAN'T PROVIDE THE WHOLE STORY, BECAUSE SCIENCE
JUST DOESN'T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT THE BIOTIN CONTENT OF PLANTS. THAT'S DUE TO
THE AMAZING FACT THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN FUNDED TO DO DETAILED ANALYSES OF
THE MINOR CONSTITUENTS OF ALL THOSE FRUITS, NUTS AND VEGGIES THAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS URGING US TO CONSUME. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONTACT YOUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE TO REQUEST FUNDING FOR MORE DETAILED NUTRITIONAL STUDIES.)
V BURDOCK (ARCTIUM LAPPA). SEBORRHEA OFTEN RESPONDS TO MASSAGING
BURDOCK ROOT OIL INTO THE SCALP, ACCORDING TO RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D., THE DEAN
OF GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE.
V CELANDINE (CHELIDONIUM MAJUS). I LEARNED ABOUT THIS ONE FROM EDWARD E. SHOOK'S ADVANCED TREATISE IN HERBOLOGY. SHOOK MAINTAINS THAT CELANDINE
WORKS NOT ONLY FOR DANDRUFF BUT ALSO FOR DRY SKIN, HIVES, CORNS AND WARTS.
154
DANDRUF F
USING CELANDINE TO TREAT DANDRUFF INVOLVES BREWING UP AN HERBAL SCALP
RINSE. INTO SIX CUPS OF WATER, PLACE ONE TEASPOON OF POTASSIUM CHLORIDE (AVAILABLE AT SUPERMARKETS AS A SALT SUBSTITUTE). HEAT AND STIR UNTIL THE POTASSIUM
CHLORIDE DISSOLVES. THEN CHOP FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH CELANDINE AND ADD IT TO THE
SOLUTION. (IF FRESH CELANDINE ISN'T AVAILABLE, YOU CAN USE A HALF-CUP OF THE DRIED
HERB INSTEAD.) LET STAND FOR TWO HOURS, THEN BOIL SLOWLY FOR 20 MINUTES. STRAIN
THE PLANT MATERIAL OUT AND SIMMER, REDUCING THE LIQUID TO 1½ CUPS. ADD EIGHT
OUNCES OF GLYCERIN AND CONTINUE SIMMERING, REDUCING THE LIQUID SLOWLY TO TWO
CUPS. STRAIN THE RESULT, BOTTLE IT AND STORE IT IN COOL PLACE. USE IT ONCE OR TWICE
A DAY AS A HAIR RINSE.
V COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE). ALLANTOIN, A CHEMICAL IN THIS
HERB, HAS ANTI-DANDRUFF PROPERTIES, ACCORDING TO HUNTINGS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
SHAMPOO INGREDIENTS. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A COMMERCIAL SHAMPOO THAT CONTAINS COMFREY AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE. IF NOT, YOU CAN ADD A COUPLE OF DROPS OF COMFREY TINCTURE TO YOUR FAVORITE HERBAL SHAMPOO.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE) AND SESAME (SESAMUM INDIE URN).
MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D.,
AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS,
VEGETABLES AND HERBS, SHARES THE FOLLOWING
EGYPTIAN DANDNIFF/SEBORRHEA TREATMENT: TAKE ONE
TO TWO TABLESPOONS OF GINGER JUICE (SQUEEZED FROM
ABOUT TWO GRATED ROOTS) AND MIX IT WITH THREE TABLESPOONS OF SESAME OIL AND A HALF-TEASPOON OF
LEMON JUICE. RUB THE MIXTURE INTO THE SCALP THREE
TIMES A WEEK. I THINK IT SOUNDS INTERESTING, ALTHOUGH SESAME OIL CAN BE EXPENSIVE. IF I HAD DANDRUFF, 1 MIGHT GIVE THIS ONE A TRY.
V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHISA GLABRA)*
LICORICE CONTAINS GLYCYRRHIZIN, A COMPOUND THAT
CAN MINIMIZE THE SCALP'S SECRETION OF OILS,
ACCORDING TO THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL
PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER. KEEPING OIL PRODUCTION DOWN SHOULD HELP CONTROL DANDRUFF. YOU
CAN STEEP A COUPLE OF HANDFULS OF DRIED HERB IN A
BOTTLE OF VINEGAR AND USE IT AS A HAIR RINSE.
V PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). LIKE COMFREY, PLANTAIN CONTAINS ALLANTOIN.
YOU COULD MAKE A STRONG TEA AND USE IT AS A HAIR
RINSE.
GINGER
THIS SPICE, USED BY THE
ANCIENT GREEKS AND ROMANS
AS A DIGESTIVE AID, HAS MANY
OTHER USES AS WEU.
155
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). TEATREE OIL, AN ANTISEPTIC FAVORED AMONG AROMATHERAPISTS, CONTAINS SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS TERPENES THAT
PENETRATE THE TOP LAYERS OF THE SCALP AND CARRY THEIR DISINFECTANT ACTIVITIES
DEEPER THAN MOST EMOLLIENTS. YOU MIGHT MIX A FEW DROPS INTO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF HERBAL SHAMPOO. JUST DON'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL OIL,
INTERNALLY. THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MANY
OF THEM CAN BE POISONOUS.
V SCARBOROUGH SHAMPOO. MANY HERBALISTS RECOMMEND THE OLD STANDARD—ONE OUNCE EACH OF DRIED SAGE AND ROSEMARY INFUSED IN TWO CUPS OF WATER
FOR 24 HOURS AND USED DAILY AS A HAIR RINSE. I THINK FD ALSO ADD THYME AS AN
EVEN MORE POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC. ADD PARSLEY AND YOU HAVE THE HERBAL COMBINATION MADE FAMOUS BY THE FOLK SONG "SCARBOROUGH FAIR"—PARSLEY, SAGE,
ROSEMARY AND THYME. YOU CAN CREATE WHAT I CALL SCARBOROUGH SHAMPOO BY
ADDING A FEW DROPS OF TINCTURE OF EACH OF THESE HERBS TO A GOOD COMMERCIAL
HERBAL SHAMPOO.
V VINEGAR AND APPLE CIDER. THESE ARE BOTH OLD FOLK REMEDIES FOR DANDRUFF. WARM ONE OR BOTH AND APPLY THE LIQUID DIRECTLY TO THE SCALP, THEN
SHAMPOO.
DEPRESSION
O
N MY FIRST TRIP TO MACCHU PICCHU, PERU, ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CONFIDED
THAT HE'D SUFFERED DEBILITATING EPISODES OF DEPRESSION. HE'D HAD ALL THE
CLASSIC SYMPTOMS: PROFOUND SADNESS, FEELINGS OF HELPLESSNESS AND HOPELESSNESS,
POOR CONCENTRATION, DISTURBED EATING, SLEEPING AND BOWEL HABITS, AND AN INABILITY TO DERIVE PLEASURE FROM NORMALLY PLEASURABLE ACTIVITIES.
ALL MODERN DRUGS HAD FAILED HIM. I BRACED MYSELF FOR THE USUAL QUESTION:
"KNOW ANY HERBS THAT MIGHT HELP?" WHEN HE ASKED, I ANSWERED WITH MY USUAL
CAUTIOUS REPLY: "IF I HAD DEPRESSION, FD TRY ST.-JOHN'S-WORT," BUT I MIGHT JUST AS
EASILY HAVE SAID "LICORICE." BOTH ARE THREE-STAR CHAMPS IN THE GREEN PHARMACY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DEPRESSION
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT EVERYONE GETS THE BLUES FROM TIME TO TIME. DEPRESSION THAT WON'T LET UP, HOWEVER, IS A SERIOUS DISORDER. IF YOU SUFFER FROM ONGOING DEPRESSION, YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR DOCTOR FOR TREATMENT. IN THE MEANTIME,
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN PROVE HELPFUL.
156
DEPRESSION
WITH MAO INHIBITORS
PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING MAO INHIBITORS, OR
USING HERBS THAT CONTAIN MAO INHIBITORS,
ON A REGULAR BASIS NEED TO AVOID CERTAIN
FOODS AND MEDICATIONS. THE FOODS TO AVOID
ARE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND ANYTHING THAT
IS SMOKED OR PICKLED. THE MEDICATIONS TO
STAY AWAY FROM ARE COLD AND HAY FEVER
REMEDIES, AMPHETAMINES, NARCOTICS, TRYPTOPHAN AND TYROSINE.
W V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). NO PLANT IN MY DATABASE HAS MORE ANTIDEPRESSANT COMPOUNDS THAN LICORICE, BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE ST.-JOHN'S-WORT'S FOLK
HISTORY OF USE AS AN ANTIDEPRESSANT.
STRANGE. AT LEAST EIGHT LICORICE COMPOUNDS ARE MONOAMINE OXIDASE
(MAO) INHIBITORS, WHICH ARE COMPOUNDS CAPABLE OF POTENT ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTION.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY LICORICE TO
BEAT DEPRESSION, SIMPLY ADD SOME TO
ANY OF THE OTHER HERBAL TEAS SUGGESTED IN THIS CHAPTER. (WHILE
LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR
NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—
UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A
DAY—LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF L , ——, .. ,, .;
, _ ———
LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.)
W%, ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). THIS HERB GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE THE PLANT
FLOWERS ON ST. JOHN'S DAY, JUNE 24. (WORT IS OLD ENGLISH
FOR "PLANT.") ITS STAR-SHAPED YELLOW FLOWERS, WHICH TURN
RED WHEN BRUISED, ARE BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE
ANYONE WITH THE BLUES FEEL HAPPIER. BUT THIS HERB ALSO
HAS A LONG HISTORY OF FOLK USE FOR TREATING ANXIETY AND
DEPRESSION. MODERN SCIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT GENERATIONS OF FOLK HERBALISTS WERE RIGHT.
CLINICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT TREATMENT WITH JUST
ONE OF THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN THIS HERB, HYPERICIN,
RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND FEELINGS OF WORTHLESSNESS. SOME STUDIES
SHOW THAT IT'S A MORE POWERFUL ANTIDEPRESSANT THAN
SOME PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS SUCH AS AMITRIPTYLINE
(ELAVIL) AND IMIPRIMINE (TOFRANIL). WHAT'S MORE, IT
HAS FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. SOME RESEARCHERS SAY THAT IT
HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS AT ALL.
STUDIES ALSO SHOW THAT ST.-JOHN'S-WORT IMPROVES
SLEEP QUALITY, OFTEN A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT
THIS HERB, ONCE USED TO
WARD OFF EVIL SPIRITS AND
TREAT SNAKEBITE, HAS
BEEN EXTENSIVELY
RESEARCHED AS AN
ANTIDEPRESSANT IN GERMANY AND THE FORMER
SOVIET UNION.

CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
F- - I
JMJIVUIIIMJ IIMF I I Y|HUFHMMH ILLLJTJUL
IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE NUTRITION TO BANISH DEPRESSION?
BEAR WITH ME A MOMENT WHILE I TRIP THROUGH SOME BIOCHEMISTRY: THE BODY
CONVERTS CARBOHYDRATES—SUGARS AND STARCHES IN YOUR DIET—TO GLUCOSE, A TYPE OF
SUGAR COMMONLY CALLED BLOOD SUGAR. GLUCOSE TRIGGERS THE PANCREAS TO RELEASE INSULIN. INSULIN IN TURN RAISES BRAIN LEVELS OF THE AMINO ACID TRYPTOPHAN, A RAW MATERIAL IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE NEUROTRANSMITTER CHEMICAL CALLED SEROTONIN.
NEUROTRANSMITTER CHEMICALS ARE USED BY NERVES TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH
OTHER AND TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. HIGH LEVELS OF SEROTONIN PRODUCE A VERY PARTICULAR
EFFECT: THE NEUROTRANSMITTER ELEVATES MOOD AND ENHANCES FEELINGS OF WELL-BEING
AND SATIETY.
IF YOU FOLLOW THIS LOGIC JUST ONE STEP FURTHER, IT SOUNDS AS IF A HIGH-CARBOHYDRATE DIET SHOULD HELP RELIEVE DEPRESSION. AND ONE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IT CAN DO
JUST THAT. AFTER EATING HIGH-CARBOHYDRATE BISCUITS, PEOPLE WITH MILD DEPRESSION—
INCLUDING PEOPLE TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING AND PREMENSTRUAL WOMEN—REPORTED
FEELING MORE MELLOW.
SO GO AHEAD: EAT MORE BISCUITS, BAGELS AND PASTA AND SEE IF IT DOESN'T MAKE
YOU FEEL BETTER.
YOU COULD ALSO BOOST YOUR INTAKE OF TRYPTOPHAN. SUNFLOWER SEEDS, PUMPKIN
SEEDS AND EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS (OENOTHERA BIENNIS) ARE ALL HIGH IN THIS FEELGOOD AMINO ACID.
ENHANCING THE AMOUNT OF SEROTONIN IN THE BODY IS, BY THE WAY, ONE OF THE ACCEPTED MEDICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING DEPRESSION. FLUOXETINE (PROZAC), THE POPULAR ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG, WORKS BY HELPING THE BODY HOLD ONTO ITS SEROTONIN.
ARE SERIOUSLY DEPRESSED. IN ONE STUDY, GERMAN RESEARCHERS GAVE ST-JOHN'S-WORT
TO 105 PEOPLE WITH MODERATE DEPRESSION. COMPARED WITH A SIMILAR GROUP NOT RECEIVING THE HERB, THEY SLEPT BETTER AND EXHIBITED LESS SADNESS, HELPLESSNESS,
HOPELESSNESS, EXHAUSTION AND HEADACHE. THEY ALSO REPORTED NO SIDE EFFECTS.
WHILE SOME RESEARCHERS ATTRIBUTE THE BENEFITS OF THE HERB TO ITS MAO
INHIBITORS, OTHER STUDIES DOWNPLAY THIS ACTIVITY. JERRY COTT, PH.D., DIRECTOR OF THE
POLYTHERAPEUTIC MEDICATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
MENTAL HEALTH IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND, TELLS ME THAT EVEN THOUGH HYPERICUM IS A
LEADING ANTIDEPRESSANT, IT HAS MUCH LESS MAO INHIBITOR ACTIVITY THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED.
COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ON THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBS, HEAPS PRAISE ON ST-JOHN'S-WORT
AS A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY IT, I'D SUGGEST A TEA MADE BY
158
DEPRESSIO N
STEEPING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR TEN MINUTES. ST.-JOHN'S-WORT APPEARS TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE IF YOU TAKE ONE TO TWO CUPS OF
TEA A DAY FOR FOUR TO SIX WEEKS, ACCORDING TO VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA. DR. TYLER SAYS THAT DIFFERENT CHEMICAL
COMPOUNDS IN ST.-JOHNVWORT WORK TOGETHER TO RELIEVE MILD DEPRESSION IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS. THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS COMBINED ACTION IS FEWER SIDE EFFECTS,
BECAUSE THE TOTAL RESPONSE IS NOT DUE TO A SINGLE STRONG ACTION.
DO NOT TAKE ST.-JOHN'S-WORT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT. AND AVOID INTENSE SUN EXPOSURE WHILE USING IT, SINCE THIS HERB CAN MAKE THE SKIN MORE SENSITIVE TO SUNLIGHT.
W GINGER {ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). IN ADDITION TO ITS UPLIFTING FLAVOR, THERE
ARE OTHER GOOD REASONS TO TAKE GINGER ALONG WITH ANY OTHER ANTIDEPRESSANT HERBS
THAT YOU ARE TAKING. GINGER HAS A LONG FOLK HISTORY OF USE FOR TREATING ANXIETY AND
DEPRESSION, AND I'VE HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT ITS GOOD EFFECTS TO MAKE ME A BELIEVER.
^V PURSLANE {PORTULACA OLERACEA). MANY PEOPLE GET THE URGE TO EAT WHEN
THEY ARE DEPRESSED. AND EATING JUST MIGHT HELP—IF YOU EAT THE RIGHT FOODS. FOODS
CONTAINING THE MINERALS MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. PURSLANE, WHICH IS VERY RICH IN THESE MINERALS, IS ALSO HIGH IN
OTHER CONSTITUENTS WITH ANTIDEPRESSANT VALUE, INCLUDING CALCIUM, FOLATE (THE NATURALLY OCCURRING FORM OF FOLIC ACID) AND LITHIUM. IN FACT, PURSLANE CONTAINS UP TO A
WHOPPING 16 PERCENT ANTIDEPRESSANT COMPOUNDS, FIGURED ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS.
WORKING WITH MY DATABASE, IT'S CLEAR THAT PURSLANE IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL
SALAD INGREDIENTS THAT MIGHT HELP RELIEVE DEPRESSION. HENCE, MY UN-SAD SALAD:
LETTUCE, PIGWEED, PURSLANE, LAMB'S-QUARTERS AND WATERCRESS. I'D ALSO BE SURE TO
USE A LITTLE THYME IN THE DRESSING, AS IT'S VERY HIGH IN THE ANTIDEPRESSANT MINERAL LITHIUM.
W ROSEMARY {ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). ROSEMARY ESSENTIAL OIL IS A FAVORITE AMONG AROMATHERAPISTS FOR TREATING DEPRESSION. A MASSAGE WITH A FEW
DROPS OF ROSEMARY OIL IN VEGETABLE OIL OR MASSAGE LOTION PROBABLY CAN'T HURT. IT
CONTAINS THE COMPOUND CINEOLE, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO STIMULATE THE CENTRAL
NERVOUS SYSTEM.
OTHER HERB OILS THAT AROMATHERAPISTS RECOMMEND FOR TREATING DEPRESSION
INCLUDE BERGAMOT, BASIL, CAMOMILE, CLARY SAGE, JASMINE, LAVENDER, NEROLI,
NUTMEG AND YLANG-YLANG. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT THESE OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL
USE ONLY.
V GINKGO {GINKGO BILOBA). STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT GINKGO MAY HELP
RELIEVE DEPRESSION, ESPECIALLY IN THE ELDERLY WHO SUFFER REDUCED BLOOD FLOW TO
THE BRAIN.
IN ONE STUDY, EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS RECRUITED A GROUP OF 40 DEPRESSED ELI 159
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
DERLY PEOPLE WITH CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW PROBLEMS WHO DID NOT RESPOND TO PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIDEPRESSANTS. THE RESEARCHERS GAVE THEM 80 MILLIGRAMS OF
GINKGO EXTRACT THREE TIMES A DAY. THEIR DEPRESSION AND MENTAL FACULTIES BOTH
IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY.
IN FACT, EUROPEAN STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USE OF STANDARDIZED GINKGO
LEAF EXTRACT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING, INCLUDING
MEMORY LOSS AND POOR CIRCULATION.
ONE STANDARD GINKGO PREPARATION, A 50:1 EXTRACT, USES 50 PARTS LEAVES TO COME
UP WITH 1 PART EXTRACT. SUCH 50:1 EXTRACTS ARE AVAILABLE IN HEALTH FOOD STORES. IF YOU
WANT TO TRY GINKGO, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT
DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESDESSNESS.
V SIBERIAN GINSENG (ELEUTHEROCOCCUS SENTICOSUS). IN STUDIES USING
LABORATORY ANIMALS, SIBERIAN GINSENG HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ACT AS AN MAO INHIBITOR.
IN PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION, THE HERB HELPS IMPROVE THEIR SENSE OF WELL-BEING. YOU
MIGHT TRY EITHER CAPSULES OR STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS.
OTHER HERBS WITH MAO INHIBITOR ACTIVITY INCLUDE CARAWAY, CELERY, CORIANDER, DILL, FENNEL AND NUTMEG.
V FOODS RICH IN B VITAMINS. NEUROTRANSMITTERS, THE CHEMICALS THAT
ALLOW NERVE CELLS TO COMMUNICATE AND FUNCTION PROPERLY, PLAY A ROLE IN DEPRESSION. NUTRITIONISTS SUGGEST GETTING ENOUGH
OF CERTAIN B VITAMINS—FOLATE AND VITAMINS B6 AND B12—TO KEEP NEUROTRANSMITTER LEVELS HIGH.
GOOD SOURCES OF FOLATE INCLUDE PINTO
BEANS, NAVY BEANS, ASPARAGUS, SPINACH,
BROCCOLI, OKRA AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS. AS
JR&A
SIBERIAN
GINSENG
THIS IS NOT TRUE
GINSENG, BUT IT HAS
SIMILAR HEALING
PROPERTIES AND IS
FREQUENTLY
USED IN THE
UNITED STATES.
FAR AS VITAMIN B, IS CONCERNED, HIGH
LEVELS OCCUR IN CAULIFLOWER, WATERCRESS,
SPINACH, BANANAS, OKRA, ONIONS, BROCCOLI,
SQUASH, KALE, KOHLRABI, BRUSSELS SPROUTS,
PEAS AND RADISHES.
YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY ADDING THE AMINO
ACID PHENYLALANINE TO YOUR DIET. IN ONE
STUDY, MORE THAN 75 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH SEVERE DEPRESSION SHOWED RAPID
IMPROVEMENT WHILE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS OF PHENYLALANINE AND VITAMIN B6. SINCE
I GENERALLY PREFER GETTING NUTRIENTS FROM FOODS, I'D RECOMMEND THE FOUR RICHEST
FOOD SOURCES—SUNFLOWER SEEDS, BLACK BEANS, WATERCRESS AND SOYBEANS. HOW
ABOUT A BLACK BEAN-SOYBEAN SOUP WITH WATERCRESS, GARNISHED WITH A SPRINKLING
OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS?

DIABETES
I
N 1989, A PHYSICIAN FROM FLORIDA WROTE TO WALTER MERTZ, M.D., THEN DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) HUMAN NUTRITION
RESEARCH CENTER IN BELTSVILLE, MARYLAND: "ENCLOSED IS A SAMPLE OF A 'WEED.' A
DIABETIC PATIENT OF MINE BROUGHT IT BACK FROM THE ISLAND OF TRINIDAD. SHE HAS
ADULT-ONSET DIABETES AND WAS TAKING INSULIN UNTIL SHE BEGAN USING THIS PLANT.
NOW SHE REPORTS THAT SHE ADDS THE WEED TO VERMOUTH AND TAKES SMALL SIPS OF
THE MIXTURE TWICE A DAY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN NORMALIZATION OF HER BLOOD SUGARS
OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS. I AM HOPING YOU WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PLANT AND
TO DETERMINE ITS EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT."
KNOWING OF MY INTEREST IN HERBAL MEDICINE, DR. MERTZ SENT ME THE LETTER
AND THE SPECIMEN, WHICH I IDENTIFIED AS JACKASS BITTERS (NEUROLAENA LOBATA), A
TALL PERENNIAL WEED VAGUELY RESEMBLING AMERICAN RAGWEED. ITS TINCTURE IS A
TIME-HONORED CREOLE-CARIBBEAN TREATMENT FOR DIABETES AND SEVERAL OTHER AILMENTS, AMONG THEM COLDS, FEVER, MALARIA AND MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS HERB REALLY HELPS WITH ALL THOSE OTHER COMPLAINTS,
BUT THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT JACKASS BITTERS HELPS REGULATE BLOOD
SUGAR (GLUCOSE) LEVELS. SO IT REALLY DOES HELP MANAGE DIABETES. IN SEVERAL
STUDIES USING EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, A TINCTURE OF THE PLANT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO
BE ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC, WHICH IS THE MEDICAL TERM FOR ANYTHING, INCLUDING INSULIN, THAT LOWERS BLOOD SUGAR. IT IS HIGH BLOOD SUGAR THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES.
IF THE ANIMAL DOSE CAN BE APPLIED TO HUMANS, A 150-POUND PERSON WOULD
HAVE TO CONSUME ABOUT AN OUNCE OF THE HERB TO GAIN SIGNIFICANT ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC BENEFITS. BUT BASED ON THE LETTER TO DR. MERTZ, APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE
GAIN REAL BENEFITS FROM TAKING CONSIDERABLY LESS. WHILE THE HERB IS DIFFICULT TO
FIND IN THE UNITED STATES, SOME HEALTH FOOD STORES AND MAIL-ORDER COMPANIES
DO CARRY IT.
PROBLEMS WITH FUEL SUPPLY
MORE THAN 2,000 YEARS AGO, THE ANCIENTS NOTICED THAT SOME PEOPLE PRODUCED
COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF STRANGELY SWEET-TASTING URINE THAT ATTRACTED ANTS. (TASTING
URINE WAS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IN MANY CULTURES.) THEY NAMED THE CONDITION DIABETES MELLITUS, FROM THE GREEK FOR "FOUNTAIN" AND THE LATIN FOR "HONEY."
DIABETES OCCURS EITHER WHEN THE PANCREAS STOPS PRODUCING THE HORMONE INSULIN OR THE BODY BECOMES UNABLE TO USE THE INSULIN IT PRODUCES. GLUCOSE, THE
J 161
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
BODY'S MAJOR FUEL, CANNOT ENTER OUR CELLS UNLESS INSULIN IS PRESENT AND WORKING.
WITHOUT INSULIN, GLUCOSE BUILDS UP IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND EVENTUALLY TURNS UP
IN THE URINE, CAUSING THE SWEET TASTE THAT THE ANCIENTS NOTICED. THE SUGAR IMBALANCE ALSO LEADS TO INCREASED URINATION AND THIRST.
DIABETES ALSO CAUSES NARROWING OF THE SMALL BLOOD VESSELS THROUGHOUT THE
BODY. IT SEEMS THAT THE HIGHER THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL, THE MORE THE SMALL BLOOD
VESSELS NARROW. AS THIS HAPPENS, THE BLOOD VESSELS CARRY LESS BLOOD, AND CIRCULATION IS IMPAIRED. POOR CIRCULATION IN TURN LEADS TO THE COMPLICATIONS OF POORLY
CONTROLLED DIABETES: KIDNEY DISEASE, POOR WOUND HEALING AND FOOT AND EYE
PROBLEMS.
DIABETIC LIMB PROBLEMS ARE THE CAUSE OF ABOUT HALF OF ALL U.S. AMPUTATIONS
NOT CAUSED BY INJURY. DIABETES ALSO ALTERS FAT METABOLISM, INCREASING THE RISK
THAT CHOLESTEROL-LADEN PLAQUE WILL BUILD UP IN THE LARGE BLOOD VESSELS. THIS
MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES ARE AT CONSIDERABLE RISK FOR HEART DISEASE.
TWO CONDITIONS, TWO APPROACHES
THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO KINDS OF DIABETES—TYPE I (INSULIN-DEPENDENT) AND
TYPE II (NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT).
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TYPE I DIABETES MUST INJECT THEMSELVES WITH INSULIN DAILY
TO CONTROL THEIR BLOOD SUGAR. PEOPLE WITH TYPE II PRODUCE THEIR OWN INSULIN, BUT
THEIR CELLS DON'T RESPOND TO IT PROPERLY.
TYPE II IS BY FAR THE MORE PREVALENT FORM OF DIABETES, ACCOUNTING FOR 85 TO
90 PERCENT OF CASES. IT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY. PEOPLE WITH TYPE II
DIABETES CAN USUALLY CONTROL THEIR BLOOD SUGAR THROUGH WEIGHT LOSS AND DIET,
SOMETIMES IN COMBINATION WITH ORAL MEDICATION THAT BOOSTS THE EFFECT OF THEIR
OWN INSULIN.
IT IS OFTEN POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES TO AVOID TAKING DRUGS,
AND I FAVOR THIS APPROACH WHENEVER POSSIBLE. MY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE TELLS
ME THAT DIETARY APPROACHES ARE CHEAPER, MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE PLEASANT THAN
MOST OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL ALTERNATIVES.
SOME SIX MILLION AMERICANS ARE UNDER TREATMENT FOR DIABETES. ALMOST AS
MANY HAVE IT AND DON'T KNOW IT. LIKE HEART DISEASE AND MANY CANCERS, DIABETES
IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH WESTERN CULTURE AND DIET. AS MEMBERS OF NONWESTERN CULTURES, NOTABLY AMERICAN INDIANS AND AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES, HAVE
SWITCHED FROM THEIR TRADITIONAL DIETS TO A MORE WESTERNIZED DIET, THEIR RATES OF
DIABETES HAVE SOARED.

DIABETES
NATURAL TACTICS TO BEAT DIABETES
DIABETES IS A SERIOUS CONDITION. IF YOU HAVE THIS DISEASE, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
BE UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE. BUT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP MANAGE
THE CONDITION.
BECAUSE OBESITY IS SO STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE II DIABETES, WEIGHT
CONTROL IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF DIABETES SELF-CARE. A LOW-FAT DIET AND REGULAR MODERATE EXERCISE IS THE WAY TO GO. I'D SUGGEST GRADUALLY WORKING UP TO THE
POINT WHERE YOU CAN WALK BRISKLY FOR AN HOUR EVERY DAY. YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW
TO WALK, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANY SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OR JOIN A HEALTH CLUB.
IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN PHYSICALLY ACTIVE, DON'T DESPAIR. WALKING AND OTHER MODERATE EXERCISE PROGRAMS PRODUCE THE GREATEST BENEFITS IN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
THE LEAST ACTIVE.
THERE'S ALSO GOOD EVIDENCE THAT SUPPLEMENTATION CAN HELP PREVENT SOME
DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS. I SUGGEST THAT YOU ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR A REFERRAL TO A
CLINICAL NUTRITIONIST WHO CAN HELP YOU DESIGN THE SUPPLEMENTATION PROGRAM
THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU. SUPPLEMENTS THAT MAY HELP INCLUDE VITAMINS B6, C AND E,
CHROMIUM PICOLINATE, MAGNESIUM, MANGANESE, PHOSPHORUS AND ZINC, PLUS
OMEGA-3 AND OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DIABETES
IN ADDITION TO EXERCISING AND TAKING SUPPLEMENTS, YOU CAN TRY MANY HERBS
TO HELP NORMALIZE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS. THE FIRST, JACKASS BITTERS, I'VE ALREADY DESCRIBED. HERE ARE THE OTHERS IN THE LINEUP.
W%, FENUGREEK (TRIGONEUA FOENUNV-GRAECTUN). ABOUT HALF OF FENUGREEK
SEED (BY WEIGHT) IS A SOLUBLE FIBER CALLED MUCILAGE. IT CONTAINS SIX COMPOUNDS THAT
HELP REGULATE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS.
FENUGREEK ALSO INCREASES BLOOD LEVELS OF HDL ("GOOD") CHOLESTEROL WHILE
LOWERING TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, SO IT CAN HELP PREVENT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, A PARI TICULAR HAZARD FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES.
V W ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONIONS HAVE A LONG FOLK HISTORY OF USE AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT TO TREAT DIABETES IN ASIA, EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST. I'M NOT
SURPRISED. ONIONS—ESPECIALLY THE SKINS—ARE ONE OF OUR BEST SOURCES OF THE COM1
 POUND QUERCETIN, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HELP WITH EYE PROBLEMS THAT ARE OFTEN
) ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES, SUCH AS DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.
VV BEANS (PHASEOLUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). MANY STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT
EATING FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN SOLUBLE FIBER, NOTABLY BEANS, REDUCES THE RISE IN BLOOD
SUGAR AFTER MEALS AND DELAYS THE DROP IN BLOOD SUGAR LATER ON, THUS HELPING TO
MAINTAIN BLOOD SUGAR AT CLOSE TO DESIRED LEVELS.

IF I HAD DIABETES, I WOULD

VV BITTER GOURD {MOMORDICA CHARANTIA). ALSO
KNOWN AS BALSAM PEAR, THIS HERB
HAS ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR ITS ABILITY TO REGULATE
BLOOD SUGAR. THE RESEARCH WAS
FIRST PUBLISHED IN INDIA IN THE
1960S, AND SINCE THEN SEVERAL
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BITTER
GOURD CAN HELP CONTROL DIABETES.
IN ONE TRIAL, FIVE GRAMS
(ABOUT TWO TEASPOONS) OF POWDERED BITTER GOURD A DAY DECREASED BLOOD SUGAR BY 54
PERCENT. IN ANOTHER, TAKING 50
MILLILITERS (ABOUT A QUARTER-CUP)
OF BITTER GOURD EXTRACT REDUCED
HIGH BLOOD SUGAR BY SOME 20
PERCENT.
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT FIDDLE
WITH EXTRACTS, IT'S OKAY TO JUST EAT
BITTER GOURD AS A SIDE DISH, ACCORDING TO MELVYN WERBACH,
M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR
OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). LIKE ONIONS, GARLIC HAS A SIGNIFICANT ABILITY
DIA-BEANIE SOUP
BEANS CONTAIN A TYPE OF FIBER THAT IS PARTICULARLY
USEFUL FOR CONTROLLING BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS, AND
ONION SKIN IS PARTICULARLY RICH IN THE BENEFICIAL

DIABETES
TO CONTROL BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS. EAT MORE GARLIC—RAW, IF POSSIBLE, OR LIGHTLY COOKED
IN FOOD.
W MAC AD AMI A NUT (MACADAMIA, VARIOUS SPECIES). SINCE 1986, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH TYPE II DIABETES HAVE CALLED FOR A DIET
WITH 15 TO 20 PERCENT OF CALORIES FROM PROTEIN, LESS THAN 35 PERCENT FROM FAT
AND 55 TO 60 PERCENT FROM CARBOHYDRATES. MORE RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT SUBSTITUTING CERTAIN HEALTHY OILS—MONOUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS (MUFAS)—FOR
SOME OF THE CARBOHYDRATES CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL WHILE NOT INCREASING CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
OLIVE OIL IS THE MOST NOTED SOURCE OF MUFAS. BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE OLIVE OIL
OR SIMPLY WANT TO EXPAND YOUR MUFA HORIZONS, TRY MACADAMIA NUTS. THEY ARE
UP TO 59 PERCENT MUFAS. OTHER GOOD SOURCES OF MUFAS INCLUDE AVOCADOS, PISTACHIO NUTS, CASHEWS, PEANUTS AND BRAZIL NUTS.
VV MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). MARSH MALLOW ROOT IS VERY HIGH
IN A SOLUBLE PLANT FIBER KNOWN AS PECTIN (35 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS). TAKING
PECTIN IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS DOWN.
I'D STEEP THE RATHER FIBROUS ROOTS IN WATER OVERNIGHT, OR BETTER YET, BUY A
COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. OTHER GOOD SOURCES OF PECTIN INCLUDE WHITE-FLOWERED
GOURD, CARROTS, ROSEHIPS, APPLES AND FIGS.
W PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). LIKE BEANS, PEANUTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO
KEEP BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS DOWN. THEY ARE CRITICIZED FOR BEING HIGH IN FAT, BUT I LOVE
THEM, MUNCH THEM FREQUENTLY AND LIKE
TO SPREAD THE NEWS OF THEIR VALUE.
V V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS).
INDIAN RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY FOR BLACK TEA. IN
STUDIES, EXTRACTS OF BLACK TEA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IN
LABORATORY ANIMALS. IF I HAD DIABETES,
I'D DRINK LOTS OF TEA. YOU MIGHT ADD
BLOOD-SUGAR-LOWERING SPICES TO THE
TEA FOR A LITTLE EXTRA HELP. IN FACT, GIVE
MY INSULINADE A TRY.
V BAY (LAURUS NOBILIS) AND
OTHER SPICES. MY FORMER USDA
COLLEAGUE, RICHARD ANDERSON, PH.D.,
HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT BAY LEAVES
HELP THE BODY USE INSULIN MORE EFFIINSUTINODE
WHERE ARE A NUMBER OF SPICES THAT RESEARCH SHOWS CAN HELP THE BODY USE INSULIN MORE EFFICIENTLY. THESE INCLUDE BAY
LEAF, CINNAMON, CLOVES AND TURMERIC.
I'D SIMPLY ADD A PINCH OR TWO OF EACH
OF THEM TO A POT OF BLACK TEA AND STEEP FOR
TEN MINUTES, THEN ICE THE TEA. I MIGHT ALSO
ADD A PINCH OF CORIANDER AND CUMIN. THE
RESEARCH IS NOT AS STRONG ON THESE TWO
> SPICES, BUT IN ANIMAL STUDIES, BOTH HAVE
BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER BLOOD SUGAR SOMEWHAT. THOSE WHO LIKE FENUGREEK MIGHT
ADD A PINCH OF THAT AS WELL.
165
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
CIENTLY AT LEVELS AS LOW AS 500 MILLIGRAMS (ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON). THE LEAVES HAVE
BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. I INCLUDE A FEW
BAY LEAVES IN MY DIA-BEANIE SOUP AS WELL AS CINNAMON, CLOVE AND TURMERIC,
WHICH ARE GOOD AT CONTROLLING BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS.
V GURMAR (GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE)* THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FOUR INDIAN
STUDIES ON THIS HERB, AN INDIAN FOLK FAVORITE FOR TREATING DIABETES. THE TEA SEEMS TO
BOOST INSULIN PRODUCTION. THERE IS ALSO SOME INTRIGUING EVIDENCE THAT IT MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ISLETS OF LANGERHANS, THE CELLS IN THE PANCREAS THAT
PRODUCE INSULIN. A FEW FORWARD-LOOKING HERBAL DEALERS ARE ALREADY MARKETING THIS
HERB IN THE UNITED STATES.
DIARRHEA
B
ACK IN MY MUSICAL DAYS, I SPENT A SUMMER PLAYING BASS FIDDLE WITH A
TRIO AT THE OCEAN FOREST HOTEL NORTH OF MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA.
OUR VOCALIST WAS ALSO A DRUMMER, BUT FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, THE MUSICIANS'
UNION WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO HAVE THREE INSTRUMENTS. SO THE VOCALIST JUST USED
DRUMMER'S BRUSHES ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER ON THE PIANO. WE TOLD THE UNION,
"LOOK, ONLY TWO INSTRUMENTS, A BASS AND A PIANO."
WHAT A SUMMER THAT WAS. MY BANDMATES AND I HAD DAY JOBS PAINTING
SIGNS, AND THEN WE PLAYED MUSIC AT NIGHT. WE DRANK TOO MUCH AND DIDN'T EAT
ENOUGH GOOD FOOD. OUR SYSTEMS WERE SO THROWN OFF-KILTER THAT WE ALL DEVELOPED
BAD CASES OF DIARRHEA. WE HONORED OUR AFFLICTION BY CALLING THE BAND THREE
SQUIRTS IN THE FOUNTAIN.
TRIE DIRE DISCOMFORT
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT DIARRHEA IS. MANY SERIOUS DISEASES CAN CAUSE IT. AND
INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA, CAUSED BY VIRUSES OR BACTERIA, STILL RANKS AS A LEADING KILLER
OF THIRD WORLD CHILDREN. BUT THIS CHAPTER IS DEVOTED TO COMMON, RUN-OF-THE-MILL
DIARRHEA THAT USUALLY CLEARS UP WITHIN 48 HOURS.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO FOR DIARRHEA IS TO DRINK FLUIDS, BUT A LOT OF
PEOPLE DO JUST THE OPPOSITE. THEY CUT DOWN IN THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT REFRAINING
FROM DRINKING FLUIDS WILL HELP THE BODY STOP PRODUCING THEM.
HOW WELL I REMEMBER ONE OF OUR ECOTOURISTS AT MACHU PICCHU. SHE WAS SO
166
DIARRHEA
CONVINCED THAT HER DIARRHEA WAS CAUSED BY THE WATER THAT SHE REFUSED TO DRINK
ANY. THE PHYSICIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED US HAD A TOUGH JOB CONVINCING HER TO
DRINK EVEN BOTTLED WATER.
THE FACT IS, THE MAIN MEDICAL RISK OF ORDINARY DIARRHEA IS DEHYDRATION. SO
KEEP GETTING FLUIDS BY SIPPING WATER OR ASTRINGENT ICED TEA THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DIARRHEA
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBAL APPROACHES TO CLEARING UP A BOUT OF DIARRHEA.
ALL OF THESE HERBS CONTAIN ONE OR MORE OF THREE NATURAL INGREDIENTS, TANNIN,
PECTIN AND MUCILAGE.
TANNINS ARE THE CHEMICALS THAT GIVE SOME HERBS THEIR ASTRINGENCY—THAT IS,
THE ABILITY TO BIND UP OR CONTRACT TISSUES. TANNINS' ASTRINGENT ACTION REDUCES INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION. THE TANNINS BIND TO THE PROTEIN LAYER OF THE INFLAMED MUCOUS MEMBRANES AND CAUSE THEM TO THICKEN, HENCE SLOWING RESORPTION OF TOXIC
MATERIALS AND RESTRICTING SECRETIONS.
PECTIN IS A SOLUBLE FIBER THAT ADDS BULK TO STOOL AND SOOTHES THE GUT. THE
"PECTATE" IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTIDIARRHEAL MEDICINE KAOPECTATE CONTAINS
PECTIN.
MUCILAGE SOOTHES THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND ADDS BULK TO STOOL BY ABSORBING
WATER AND SWELLING CONSIDERABLY.
HERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE MANY HERBS THAT CAN BE HELPFUL.
V AGRIMONY (AGRIMONIA EUPATORIA). COMMISSION E ENDORSES AGRIMONY FOR COMMON DIARRHEA, PROBABLY DUE TO ITS HIGH TANNIN CONTENT. TRY USING
TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF LEAVES TO MAKE A TEA.
V APPLE {MAINS DOMESTIC A). APPLE PULP IS RICH IN PECTIN. THAT'S WHY
APPLES AND APPLESAUCE ARE A HALLOWED FOLK REMEDY FOR DIARRHEA. (APPLE PECTIN
ALSO HELPS TREAT CONSTIPATION BECAUSE IT ACTS AS A GENDE STOOL SOFTENER. LIKE PSYLLIUM, IT'S AMPHOTERIC, WHICH MEANS THAT IT WORKS IN EITHER DIRECTION, PLUGGING
YOU UP IF YOUR BOWELS ARE LOOSE OR LOOSENING YOU UP IF YOU ARE CONSTIPATED.)
V BILBERRY AND BLUEBERRY (VACCIMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). DRIED (NOT
FRESH) FRUITS OF BILBERRY AND BLUEBERRY HELP RELIEVE DIARRHEA BECAUSE THEY ARE
RICH IN BOTH TANNINS AND PECTIN.
V BLACKBERRY AND RASPBERRY (RUBUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). COMMISSION
E, THE BODY OF SCIENTISTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, SUGGESTS MAKING AN ASTRINGENT TEA WITH TWO TEASPOONS OF BLACKBERRY LEAF. ODDLY, IT
DOES NOT MENTION RASPBERRY LEAF, WHICH IS A CLOSE BOTANICAL RELATIVE THAT IS ALSO
HIGH IN TANNIN. I'VE USED BOTH AND FOUND THEM EFFECTIVE.
V CAROB (CERATONIA SILIQUA). YEARS AGO IN PANAMA, I HAD AN ACUTE AT167
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TACK OF SALMONELLA, A TYPE OF FOOD POISONING, AFTER I'D HANDLED FRESH-WATER TURTLES
THAT HARBOR THE BACTERIA. MY PANAMANIAN DOCTOR PRESCRIBED POWDERED CAROB FOR
THE DIARRHEA, AND IT SEEMED TO WORK. THAT WAS NEARLY 30 YEARS AGO.
THEN JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, I REVIEWED A STUDY OF 41 INFANTS WITH BACTERIAL
OR VIRAL DIARRHEA. CHILDREN GIVEN AN INACTIVE SUBSTANCE (A PLACEBO) HAD DIARRHEA
FOR AN AVERAGE OF NEARLY FOUR DAYS. CHILDREN GIVEN CAROB POWDER HAD IT FOR ONLY
TWO DAYS.
V CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). I LIKE THE IDEA OF USING COOKED CARROTS TO
TREAT INFANT DIARRHEA. WHEN THEY'RE COOKED, CARROTS SEEM TO SOOTHE THE DIGESTIVE
TRACT AND CONTROL THE DIARRHEA WHILE ALSO PROVIDING NUTRIENTS THAT ARE LOST DURING
THE ATTACK.
V FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). THE SEEDS OF THIS HERB
CONTAIN UP TO 50 PERCENT MUCILAGE, SO THEY SWELL IN THE GUT, THUS RELIEVING DIARRHEA. (THEY ALSO HELP RELIEVE CONSTIPATION BY SOFTENING STOOL.) JUST DON'T USE
MORE THAN TWO TEASPOONS AT A TIME, AS MORE MAY CAUSE ABDOMINAL DISTRESS.
V OAK (QUERCUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS USING
ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED OAK BARK TO MAKE AN ASTRINGENT TEA.
V POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM). POMEGRANATE, AN HERB MENTIONED
IN THE BIBLE, IS OFTEN USED TO TREAT DIARRHEA. I'M NOT SURPRISED, BECAUSE THE SEEDS
ARE ASTRINGENT.
V PSYLLIUM (PLANTAGO OVATA). PSYLLIUM IS USEFUL FOR RELIEVING CONSTIPATION. ITS HIGH MUCILAGE CONTENT ALSO MAKES IT USEFUL FOR TREATING DIARRHEA. BY
ABSORBING A GREAT DEAL OF WATER, PSYLLIUM ADDS BULK TO STOOL. (IN CONSTIPATION, IT
SPEEDS UP TRANSIT TIME BY INCREASING THE VOLUME OF BOWEL CONTENT.) YOU SHOULD
WATCH HOW YOU REACT TO THIS HERB IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, HOWEVER. IF ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS DEVELOP AFTER YOU TAKE IT ONCE, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). ONE OF THE MOST ASTRINGENT PLANTS AROUND IS
CONVENTIONAL TEA IN CONVENTIONAL TEA BAGS. UNDER FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS, LIPTON CAN'T MAKE MEDICINAL CLAIMS. BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU
HAVE DIARRHEA, TRY A NICE CUP OF TEA.
DIVERTICULITIS
B
ACK IN 1972, DURING AN ADMINISTRATIVE STINT AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE, I HAD A HARD-WORKING SECRETARY WHO WAS PLAGUED BY
DIVERTICULITIS. IT MANIFESTED ITSELF AS ABDOMINAL PAIN AND CRAMPING, USUALLY
168
DIVERTICULITIS
ON THE LOWER LEFT SIDE, PLUS OCCASIONAL FEVER AND BLOODY STOOL. I FELT FOR HER. MY
YOUNGER BROTHER HAD ALSO HAD DIVERTICULITIS.
AT THE TIME, DIETARY TREATMENT FOR DIVERTICULITIS WAS QUITE CONTROVERSIAL.
DOCTORS HAD BEEN RECOMMENDING A LOW-FIBER DIET TO TREAT IT FOR ABOUT 50 YEARS,
AND MY SECRETARY'S DOCTORS TOLD HER TO AVOID FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. BUT THAT
DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO THE THEN-SMALL GROUP OF NATURAL MEDICINE ADVOCATES, INCLUDING YOURS TRULY, WHO WERE INTO HIGH-FIBER WHOLE FOODS.
EVEN A CURSORY LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE EAT AROUND THE WORLD SHOWED THAT CULTURES WITH A HIGH-FIBER DIET HAD LITTLE OR NO DIVERTICULITIS (AND LITTLE OR NO CONSTIPATION). MEANWHILE, IN THE INDUSTRIAL WEST, WITH ITS PROCESSED FOODS AND
LOW-FIBER DIET, DIVERTICULITIS WAS COMMON. (AND INCIDENTALLY, CONSTIPATION WAS
RAMPANT.)
MY SECRETARY FELT TORN BETWEEN THE ADVICE OF THOSE ADVOCATING HIGH FIBER
AND LOW FIBER, AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO ADDED A GOOD DEAL OF STRESS TO HER
ALREADY UNPLEASANT SITUATION. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THAT VERY YEAR BRITISH RESEARCHER NEIL PAINTER, M.D., OF MANOR HOUSE HOSPITAL, LONDON, PUBLISHED A
STUDY IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL THAT ALL BUT PROVED THAT DIVERTICULAR DISEASE WAS CAUSED BY A LOW-FIBER DIET. HE RECRUITED SOME 70 PEOPLE WITH DIVERTICULITIS AND PLACED THEM ON A DIET OF WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD, HIGH-BRAN CEREALS
AND PLENTY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THAT HIGH-FIBER DIET CURED OR SUBSTANTIALLY
RELIEVED SYMPTOMS IN 89 PERCENT OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS.
I SHOWED MY SECRETARY THE STUDY, AND I HOPE SHE TOOK IT TO HEART. BUT ALAS,
OUR CAREERS TOOK US IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, AND I LOST TRACK OF HER, SO I DON'T
KNOW HOW SHE FARED.
PREVENTION WITN FIBER
TODAY, OF COURSE, DOCTORS KNOW THAT A HIGH-FIBER DIET IS THE WAY TO GO. I'VE
ALWAYS EATEN THAT WAY—LOTS OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES, BREADS AND HERBS—WHICH
IS WHY, UNLIKE MY BROTHER AND SECRETARY, I'VE NEVER BEEN BOTHERED BY EITHER
DIVERTICULITIS OR CONSTIPATION.
OUR ANCESTORS ATE LOTS OF FIBER, AND OUR COLONS EVOLVED TO HANDLE IT.
WITHOUT ENOUGH FIBER, WE KNOW, STRANGE THINGS BEGIN TO HAPPEN DOWN THERE.
FOOD MOVES MORE SLOWLY THROUGH THE COLON, CAUSING CONSTIPATION, AND LITTLE
POCKETS KNOWN AS DIVERTICULA DEVELOP IN THE COLON WALL. SOMETIMES DIVERTICULA BECOME PLUGGED WITH LITTLE BITS OF DIGESTED FOOD AND OFTEN LITTLE SEEDS. IF
DIVERTICULA BECOME INFLAMED AND SWELL, THEY CAUSE PAIN AND THE OTHER SYMPTOMS OF DIVERTICULITIS.
MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE OVER 60 HAVE NONINFLAMED, PAINLESS DIVERTICULA,
169
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WHILE AN ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT DEVELOP THE INFLAMMATION OF DIVERTICULITIS.
TO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF DIVERTICULITIS, THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE A
HIGH-FIBER DIET AND EXERCISE, ACCORDING TO WALID H. ALDOORI, M.D., PROFESSOR IN
THE DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION AT THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT
WHILE YOU'RE EATING MORE WHOLE GRAINS AND FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, YOU
SHOULD WATCH SOME OTHER DIETARY FACTORS AS WELL. BE SURE TO DRINK PLENTY OF
NONALCOHOLIC FLUIDS TO KEEP THINGS MOVING EFFICIENTLY THROUGH YOUR DIGESTIVE
TRACT. AND IF YOU'VE HAD DIVERTICULITIS, YOU SHOULD STEER CLEAR OF SOME SMALL,
INDIGESTIBLE SEEDS—POPPY, SESAME, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY—WHICH CAN
PLUG DIVERTICULA AND AGGRAVATE THE CONDITION.
FINALLY, NATURAL MEDICINE EXPERT AND HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL, M.D.,
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, SUGGESTS ELIMINATING TOBACCO,
WHICH IS GOOD ADVICE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE DIVERTICULITIS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DIVERTICULITIS
THERE ARE MANY HERBS THAT CAN HELP. HERE ARE MY FAVORITES.
V*J%> FLAX (LINUM USITATI&SIMUM). COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN EXPERT
PANEL THAT PASSES ON THE SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS AND DOSAGE OF MEDICINAL HERBS FOR
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, APPROVES USING ONE TO THREE TABLESPOONS OF CRUSHED
FLAXSEED TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY (WITH LOTS OF WATER) TO TREAT DIVERTICULITIS.
V W PSYLLIUM (PLANTAGO OVATA). POWDERY, HIGH-FIBER PSYLLIUM SEED IS
THE MAJOR INGREDIENT IN METAMUCIL AND A FEW OTHER BULK-FORMING COMMERCIAL
LAXATIVES. A FEW TABLESPOONS A DAY (WITH PLENTY OF WATER) PROVIDE A HEALTHY
AMOUNT OF DIVERTICULITIS-PREVENTING FIBER. WATCH HOW YOU REACT TO THIS HERB IF
YOU HAVE ALLERGIES, HOWEVER. IF ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS DEVELOP AFTER YOU TAKE IT
ONCE, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
W \ WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM). DR. PAINTER, WHOSE STUDY FOUND A HIGHFIBER DIET TO BE THE CURE FOR DIVERTICULITIS, ESTIMATED THAT WHEAT BRAN CONTAINS
FIVE TIMES THE FIBER OF WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD, MAKING IT THE FIBER-LOVER'S FIBER. HE'S
NOT ALONE IN HIS ENDORSEMENT OF WHEAT BRAN.
"BRAN IS THE SAFEST, CHEAPEST AND MOST PHYSIOLOGICALLY EFFECTIVE METHOD
OF TREATING AND PREVENTING CONSTIPATION," SAYS GASTROENTEROLOGIST W. GRANT
THOMPSON, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA. AND, I MIGHT ADD,
WHEN YOU'RE AVOIDING CONSTIPATION YOU'RE ALSO AVOIDING DIVERTICULITIS.
W SLIPPERY ELM (ULMUS RUBRA). DR. WEIL SUGGESTS USING SLIPPERY ELM
BARK POWDER TO TREAT DIVERTICULITIS. THE FIBROUS BARK CONTAINS LARGE QUANTITIES
OF A GENTLE LAXATIVE THAT SOOTHES THE DIGESTIVE TRACT WHILE KEEPING THINGS
MOVING.
170
DIZZINESS
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS DECLARED SLIPPERY ELM TO BE A SAFE
AND EFFECTIVE DIGESTIVE SOOTHER. PREPARE IT LIKE OATMEAL, ADDING HOT MILK OR
WATER TO THE POWDERED BARK TO MAKE A CEREAL.
V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA), BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, SUGGESTS SIPPING ON CAMOMILE TEA
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THIS HERB IS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN TREATING DIVERTICULITIS
BECAUSE ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION SOOTHES THE ENTIRE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, HE
SAYS. I SUGGEST MAKING A TEA WITH TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED CAMOMILE PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER. STEEP FOR FIVE TO TEN MINUTES.
V PRUNE (PRUNUS DULCIS). PRUNES COMBINE LOTS OF FIBER WITH A SWEET,
DELICIOUS TASTE. THEY'VE BEEN A FOLK REMEDY FOR CONSTIPATION FOR AGES. IF I HAD
DIVERTICULITIS, PD EAT PLENTY OF PRUNES OR DRINK PRUNE JUICE.
V WILD YAM (DIOSCOREA VILIOSA). ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA HERBALIST
KATHI KEVILLE, AUTHOR OF THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR
HEALTH AND HEALING, WHOM I HIGHLY RESPECT, WILD YAM HELPS RELIEVE THE PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION OF DIVERTICULITIS. I LIKE HER FORMULA: TWO PARTS WILD YAM,
(ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTISPASMODIC), ONE PART VALERIAN (RELAXING DIGESTIVE
TRACT SOOTHER), ONE PART BLACK HAW (ANTISPASMODIC) AND ONE PART PEPPERMINT
(ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTISPASMODIC).
IF I HAD DIVERTICULITIS, I MIGHT USE A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF THIS HERB
MIXTURE BREWED IN A QUART OR SO OF WATER.
DIZZINESS
O
NCE WHEN MRS. DUKE WAS EXPERIENCING DIZZINESS, SHE WENT TO THE
DOCTOR. SHE CAME HOME WITH AN $18 PACKET OF TRANSDERM SCOP—
STICK-ON PATCHES PRODUCED BY CIBA GEIGY THAT ADMINISTERED THE DRUG SCOPOLAMINE BY ABSORPTION THROUGH THE SKIN. FOR QUITE A WHILE, SCOPOLAMINE WAS
THE STANDARD MEDICATION FOR DIZZINESS AND MOTION SICKNESS.
LITTLE DID PEGGY KNOW THAT SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN SCOPOLAMINE MUCH MORE
CHEAPLY BY GATHERING SOME PLANTS IN OUR FRONT YARD. MY JIMSONWEED (DATURA
STRAMONIUM) AND CULTIVATED ORNAMENTAL DATURA SPECIES ALL CONTAIN SCOPOLAMINE, ALTHOUGH PERHAPS LESS THAN THE PHARMACEUTICAL.
PERSONALLY, I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND SCOPOLAMINE, EVEN FROM NATURAL
SOURCES, FOR DIZZINESS. IT MAY WORK, BUT IT CAN ALSO CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS
171
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
BLURRED VISION, DRY MOUTH, HALLUCINATIONS AND HEART PALPITATIONS. I PREFER
GINGER FOR SEASICKNESS, MOTION SICKNESS, MORNING SICKNESS AND ANYTHING ELSE
THAT CAN CAUSE DIZZINESS OR VERTIGO.
THE TERMS DIZZINESS AND VERTIGO ARE OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY, BUT TECHNICALLY THERE IS A DISTINCTION. DIZZINESS SIMPLY MEANS UNSTEADINESS. VERTIGO
IS WORSE. IT IS A DISORIENTING ILLUSION OF MOVEMENT, AS IF THE WORLD WERE
WHIRLING AROUND YOU, OR YOU AROUND IT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DIZZINESS
IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC DIZZINESS, SEE A PHYSICIAN. PROLONGED OR RECURRING
BOUTS OF DIZZINESS CAN BE A SIGN OF INNER EAR INFECTION, CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA,
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR SOME OTHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS. FOR OCCASIONAL BOUTS OF
DIZZINESS, THERE ARE SEVERAL HERBS THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL.
W%, GINGER {ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). CHINESE SAILORS CHEWED GINGER ROOT FOR
SEASICKNESS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, AND AS THEY TRAVELED, THEIR REMEDY DID, TOO—
FROM ASIA TO INDIA TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND ON TO EUROPE.
MM MODERN SCIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT
THERE IS SOME VALIDITY TO THIS ANCIENT
REMEDY. ONE STUDY OF BO NAVAL CADETS,
FOR EXAMPLE, SHOWED THAT TAKING ONE
GRAM (A HALF-TEASPOON) OF POWDERED
GINGER SHORTLY BEFORE SHOVING OFF REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF SEASICKNESS—INCLUDING DIZZINESS—BY 38 PERCENT AND
FREQUENCY OF VOMITING BY 72 PERCENT.
IN EARLIER STUDIES ON LAND WITH 18
HEALTHY SUBJECTS, ONE GRAM OF GINGER
RELIEVED VERTIGO AND MOTION SICKNESS
BETTER THAN THE STANDARD DRUG, DIMENHYDRINATE (DRAMAMINE).
"TO PREVENT MOTION SICKNESS,
SWALLOW TWO CAPSULES 30 MINUTES BEFORE
DEPARTURE AND THEN ONE TO TWO MORE AS
SYMPTOMS BEGIN TO OCCUR, PROBABLY
ABOUT EVERY FOUR HOURS," SUGGESTS VARRO
TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT

GOOD STUDIES SUPPORT THIS USE. BUT NOT EVERY
STUDY HAS BEEN FAVORABLE.
ONE STUDY, SPONSORED BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, I SUSPECT, CONCLUDED
THAT GINGER WAS INEFFECTIVE AND THE ANTIDIZZINESS MEDICATION SCOPOLAMINE WAS EFFECTIVE. PERSONALLY, I DON'T BUY INTO THE
RESULTS OF A SINGLE STUDY, BUT WITHOUT AN
UNBIASED COMPARATIVE STUDY, I MAY NEVER
KNOW WHICH OF THESE ALTERNATIVES IS MORE
EFFECTIVE.
UNLESS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORS STUDIES COMPARING NEW DRUGS (SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL) NOT ONLY WITH PLACEBOS
BUT ALSO WITH THE BEST HERBAL ALTERNATIVES,
WE MAY NOT BE GETTING THE BEST MEDICINES.
I WANT THE BEST, WHATEVER IT IS.

W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO EXTRACT IS PRESCRIBED EXTENSIVELY IN
EUROPE FOR VERTIGO, AMONG MANY OTHER CONDITIONS. ONE FRENCH STUDY OF 70
PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC VERTIGO SHOWED THAT 47 PERCENT IMPROVED WHILE TAKING
GINKGO. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN
THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESDESSNESS.
V CELERY (APIUM GRAVEOLENS). CELERY SEED HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE
IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE AS A TREATMENT FOR DIZZINESS.
V PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO). SOME HERBALISTS I RESPECT CLAIM THAT
PUMPKIN SEEDS HELP RELIEVE DIZZINESS. IF I WERE GOING TO TAKE THIS REMEDY MYSELF, I'D HAVE SOME PUMPKIN SEED BUTTER.

HE TUPI GUARANI INDIANS OF BRAZIL HAVE A PLANT CALLED JABORANDI THAT
CAUSES SALIVATION. IN FACT, IN THE TUPI LANGUAGE, JABORANDI MEANS
"THAT WHICH CAUSES SLOBBERING."
WHEN RESEARCHERS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DENTAL RESEARCH (NIDR)
HEARD ABOUT JABORANDI FROM SOME ETHNOBOTANISTS, THEY GOT ALL EXCITED. (AN ETHNOBOTANIST IS A PLANT SPECIALIST WHO STUDIES THE MEDICINAL USES OF PLANTS IN
OTHER CULTURES.) LOTS OF PEOPLE SUFFER FROM DRY MOUTH SYNDROME, MEDICALLY
KNOWN AS XEROSTOMA, SO THE FOLKS AT NIDR ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR NEW
SUBSTANCES THAT STIMULATE SALIVATION. JABORANDI SOUNDED PROMISING.
THE INGREDIENT IN JABORANDI (PILOCARPUS, VARIOUS SPECIES) THAT CAUSES SALIVATION IS A COMPOUND CALLED PILOCARPINE. GOOD STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PILOCARPINE INCREASES PRODUCTION OF SALIVA UP TO TENFOLD, EASILY RELIEVING THE

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
UNCOMFORTABLE SENSATION OF ORAL DRYNESS. CLEARLY JABORANDI DESERVES MORE
STUDY.
DROOLING OVER THE POSSIBILITIES
ACTUALLY, WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT JABORANDI, I GOT PRETTY EXCITED MYSELF. I
IMAGINED INCORPORATING IT INTO A CHEWING GUM THAT COULD RELIEVE DRY MOUTH,
PROVIDING EASY RELIEF FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
BUT THERE WAS A CATCH, BOTH FOR ME AND FOR THE NIDR. BRAZIL HAS A VIRTUAL
MONOPOLY ON THE SUPPLY OF PILOCARPINE, WHICH IS ALSO USED TO TREAT CERTAIN
TYPES OF GLAUCOMA, AND THEY DON'T WANT ANY OF THEIR PRECIOUS LIVING SOURCE
LEAVING THE COUNTRY. IF THEY CONTROL THE SUPPLY, THEY CONTROL THE PRICE. THEY
ARE HAPPY TO EXPORT THE PILOCARPINE THEY EXTRACT FROM JABORANDI, BUT THE GOVERNMENT PROHIBITS THE EXPORT OF LIVING PLANTS FOR FEAR THAT SOMEONE ELSE WILL
START EXTRACTING PILOCARPINE FROM THEM AND SELL IT MORE CHEAPLY. AS A RESULT, I
WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET ANY JABORANDI OUT OF BRAZIL.
AND LORD KNOWS, I TRIED. I HOOKED UP WITH A JOHNS HOPKINS OPHTHALMOLOGIST AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS, WHO HAD AN INTEREST IN JABORANDI'S ANTI-GLAUCOMA ACTION, AND WE WENT CHASING THROUGH THE BUSH COUNTRY OF BRAZIL IN
SEARCH OF THE PRECIOUS PLANTS. BUT OUR EFFORTS CAME TO A HALT WHEN WE WERE
BLOCKED BY THE AUTHORITIES.
SOME TIME LATER, I SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING A RELATED SPECIES OF PILOCARPUS
FROM PARAGUAY. BUT AGAIN THERE WAS A CATCH. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA) WERE CONCERNED THAT MY JABORANDI CITRUS
RELATIVE MIGHT HARBOR VIRUSES THAT COULD DECIMATE THE U.S. CITRUS INDUSTRY.
THEY DESTROYED MY PLANT.
A YEAR LATER, I MANAGED TO GET ONE JABORANDI PLANT INTO THE UNITED STATES
FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. AGAIN, THE USDA GOT NERVOUS ABOUT VIRUSES, BUT THIS
TIME I SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING THEM NOT TO DESTROY THE PRECIOUS PLANT. INSTEAD THEY PLACED IT UNDER QUARANTINE AT THE BELTSVILLE RESEARCH STATION WHERE
I WORKED. MY JABORANDI SAT THERE FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND MY HOPES OF EVER RETRIEVING IT FADED.
AFTER I RETIRED, I LEARNED THAT THE QUARANTINE HAD BEEN LIFTED. I PICKED UP
MY JABORANDI AND TRANSPLANTED IT TO MY BACKYARD. IT'S A NICE PLANT.
MEANWHILE, MGI PHARMA OF MINNEAPOLIS DEVELOPED A PILOCARPINE-BASED
MOUTH-MOISTENING DRUG THAT IT HOPES TO CALL SALAGEM; IT'S AWAITING APPROVAL
FROM THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL GET RICH
WHILE A PERFECTLY EFFECTIVE NONDRUG SOLUTION LANGUISHES IN MY BACKYARD AND
IN BRAZIL.

DRY MOUTH IS NOT ONLY UNCOMFORTABLE, IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD FOR YOU. SALIVA
HELPS CONTROL BACTERIA POPULATIONS IN THE MOUTH, AND IN DOING SO IT HELPS PREVENT TOOTH DECAY, GUM DISEASE AND MOUTH INFECTIONS.
AN ESTIMATED 25 PERCENT OF OLDER AMERICANS COMPLAIN OF DRY MOUTH. THE
CONDITION IS COMMON AMONG PUBLIC SPEAKERS LIKE ME, HENCE THE INEVITABLE
WATER GLASS AT THE PODIUM. IT IS ALSO RELATED TO AGING AND IS A SIDE EFFECT OF
MORE THAN 400 WIDELY USED MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING MANY PRESCRIBED FOR HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE AND DEPRESSION.
IN ADDITION, DRY MOUTH IS A SYMPTOM OF SJOGREN'S SYNDROME, A CONDITION
OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS THAT ALSO CAUSES DRY EYES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR DRY MOUTH
IF YOU'RE EVER CAUGHT WITH DRY MOUTH IN BRAZIL, YOU COULD TRY CHEWING
SOME JABORANDI. HERE IN THE STATES, UNTIL THE PILOCARPINE MEDICATION WINS
FDA APPROVAL, SIP WATER FREQUENTLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN EATING OR SPEAKING.
AVOID COFFEE AND SUGARY BEVERAGES, BOTH OF WHICH CAN AGGRAVATE DRY MOUTH.
ALSO AVOID ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND SALTY FOODS. IN ADDITION, TRY THESE HERBS.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ONE COMPOUND IN ECHINACEA, ECHINACEIN, IS A PROVEN SALIVA PRODUCER. I RECOMMEND TAKING A DROPPERFUL OF TINCTURE IN JUICE. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH PLANT, YOU CAN ALSO
CHEW THE ROOT. IN ADDITION TO STIMULATING SALIVATION, ECHINACEA TENDS TO NUMB
THE MOUTH, BUT THIS EFFECT IS TEMPORARY AND HARMLESS.
V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS)* OIL FROM THE EVENING
PRIMROSE (EPO) IS A RICH SOURCE OF A COMPOUND KNOWN AS GAMMA-LINOLENIC
ACID (GLA). FEW REVIEWING THE MEDICAL LITERATURE CAN HAVE ANY DOUBTS THAT
GLA IS A POTENT TREATMENT FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS, WHICH ARE CAUSED BY A
CONFUSED IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKING THE BODY ITSELF. SJOGREN'S SYNDROME IS
THOUGHT TO BE AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER.
IF I HAD DRY MOUTH CAUSED BY SJOGREN'S, I WOULD TRY EPO. YOU CAN BUY
CAPSULES OF EPO IN NATURAL FOOD STORES. SIMPLY FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V MULTIFLORA ROSE (ROSA MULTIFLORA). IN CHINA, PEOPLE SIMMER TWO TO
FOUR TEASPOONS OF THE DRIED FLOWER PER CUP OF BOILING WATER TO MAKE A TEA FOR
TREATING DRY MOUTH.
V RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). CAPSAICIN, THE FIERY
COMPOUND IN HOT PEPPER, STIMULATES NOT ONLY SALIVATION BUT ALSO OTHER WATERY
DISCHARGES—SWEAT AND TEARS. THE HOTTER THE PEPPER, THE MORE CAPSAICIN IT
CONTAINS. YOU CAN ADD RED PEPPER TO FOOD OR STIR IT INTO JUICE OR TEA.

APHRODISIAC THAT STIMULATES BOTH ERECTION AND SALIVATION. CURRENTLY, MANY
AMERICAN MEN ARE TAKING YOHIMBINE, AN EXTRACT OF YOHIMBE, TO TREAT ERECTION
IMPAIRMENT, SO IT'S READILY AVAILABLE. IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS HERB TO TREAT DRY
MOUTH, I RECOMMEND ASKING YOUR DOCTOR FOR A PRESCRIPTION FOR YOHIMBINE.
USING THE HERB ITSELF—A DRIED BARK—CAN BE HAZARDOUS.
EAR ACNE
T
HERE I WAS ON KELLEY'S ISLAND IN LAKE ERIE ON A BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAY,
LEADING A WORKSHOP ON MEDICINAL HERBS. AT OUR FEET WERE MULLEIN
PLANTS, AN AGE-OLD REMEDY FOR EARACHE. IT WAS EARLY JUNE, TOO EARLY FOR THE
MULLEIN TO BE IN FLOWER. BUT THE FUZZY LEAVES WERE EVERYWHERE, AND THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S TALL FLOWER STALKS WERE ABUNDANT AS WELL.
DOWN IN SOUTHERN OHIO, THERE'S AN HERBALIST WHO IS PRODUCING AN EARACHE
SALVE BASED ON MULLEIN FLOWERS AND GOLDENSEAL. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN MY WORKSHOP HAD TRIED THIS SALVE ON THEIR CHILDREN AFTER DOCTORS HAD
FAILED TO CURE THEIR EAR INFECTIONS WITH ANTIBIOTICS AND EVEN SURGERY. SEVERAL
SWORE THAT IT WORKED. BECAUSE OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT MULLEIN AND GOLDENSEAL,
I'M INCLINED TO TRUST THEIR REPORTS.
EARACHE HAS MANY POSSIBLE CAUSES. IN CHILDREN, THE MOST COMMON BY FAR
IS AN INFECTION THAT INVADES THE MIDDLE EAR—WHAT DOCTORS CALL OTITIS MEDIA.
BUT EARACHE CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY EXCESS EARWAX, A PERFORATED EARDRUM AND
OTHER CONDITIONS IN THE HEAD AND NECK. THERE'S ALSO AN OUTER EAR INFECTION
CALLED OTITIS EXTERNA.
THE ACTUAL INFECTION MAY BE BACTERIAL, VIRAL OR FUNGAL. AN ESTIMATED 80
PERCENT OF CHILDREN HAVE AT LEAST ONE MIDDLE EAR INFECTION DURING THEIR FIRST
FIVE YEARS. BREASTFEEDING APPARENTLY OFFERS SOME PROTECTION. COMPARED WITH
BOTTLE-FED BABIES, BREASTFED INFANTS DEVELOP FEWER EAR INFECTIONS, AND THE
LONGER THE BABY NURSES, THE LOWER THE RISK.
OFTEN, PEDIATRICIANS HAVE PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS TO HELP STOP EAR INFECTIONS. BUT RECENTLY, MORE AND MORE PHYSICIANS ARE ADVISING AGAINST BEING
TRIGGER-HAPPY WITH ANTIBIOTICS.
176
EARACH E
PROBLEMS WITK ASPIRIN
EARACHE TREATMENT BEGINS WITH PAIN RELIEF AND THEN PROCEEDS TO DEALING
WITH THE CAUSE. PHYSICIANS TREAT THE PAIN WITH ACETAMINOPHEN (OR ASPIRIN FOR
ADULTS), THEN GIVE ANTIBIOTICS AND DECONGESTANTS TO TREAT THE INFECTION ITSELF.
THERE ARE ALSO SOME GOOD HERBS THAT CAN HELP ADULTS DEAL WITH THE PAIN
EVEN BEFORE THEY SEE THE DOCTOR. FOR ADULT EARACHES, I'D TRY RELIEVING THE PAIN
WITH A TEA MADE OF WILLOW BARK AND WINTERGREEN. THESE HERBS CONTAIN SALICIN
AND SALICYLATES, WHICH ARE NATURAL PRECURSORS OF PHARMACEUTICAL ASPIRIN. (IF
YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, HOWEVER, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE HERBAL ASPIRIN EITHER.)
BUT DO NOT GIVE EITHER ASPIRIN OR ITS NATURAL HERBAL ALTERNATIVES TO CHILDREN
WHO DEVELOP EAR INFECTIONS ALONG WITH COLDS. WHEN CHILDREN TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE
DRUGS FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS (ESPECIALLY COLDS, FLU AND CHICKEN POX), THERE'S A
CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT GET REYE'S SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION THAT
DAMAGES THE LIVER AND BRAIN. THIS HERBALIST HATES TO SAY IT, BUT IF MY GRANDKIDS DEVELOPED EAR INFECTIONS FROM COLDS, I'D TREAT THEIR EAR PAIN WITH ACETAMINOPHEN RATHER THAN HERBAL RELATIVES OF ASPIRIN.
ONCE YOU'VE TREATED THE PAIN, IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER THE CAUSE. A DOCTOR CAN
LOOK IN THE AFFECTED EAR AND DECIDE IF YOU HAVE AN EXTERNAL OR AN INTERNAL
PROBLEM.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR EARACHE
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THE PAIN OF EARACHE OR
TREAT THE CAUSES.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN
AS CONEFLOWER, HAS BOTH ANTIBIOTIC AND IMMUNE-BOOSTING EFFECTS. YOU CAN TRY
USING A TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB IN TEA OR A DROPPERFUL OF ECHINACEA TINCTURE IN
JUICE OR TEA. DRINK EITHER THREE TIMES A DAY. I USE ECHINACEA TO TREAT ALL SORTS OF
INFECTIONS, AND I WOULD PROBABLY TRY IT IF I HAD AN EARACHE. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA
CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
V EPHEDRA (EPHEDRA SINICA). ALSO KNOWN AS MA HUANG OR CHINESE
EPHEDRA, THIS HERB CONTAINS TWO POWERFUL DECONGESTANTS, EPHEDRINE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE. THEY CAN HELP DRAIN THE FLUID IN THE MIDDLE EAR THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH MIDDLE EAR INFECTIONS. PSEUDOEPHEDRINE IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN
MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER DECONGESTANTS. ONE OF THESE PRODUCTS, SUDAFED, EVEN
TAKES ITS NAME FROM THIS COMPOUND. IN A STUDY OF FLIERS WITH RECURRENT EAR
PAIN, 70 PERCENT OF THOSE WHO TOOK PSEUDOEPHEDRINE EXPERIENCED RELIEF.
177
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
BE CAREFUL TO STICK TO THE RECOMMENDED DOSES WHEN USING THIS HERB.
ADULTS SHOULDN'T USE MORE THAN ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB TO MAKE A TEA OR
TAKE MORE THAN ONE TEASPOON OF TINCTURE. ALTHOUGH THE HERB CAN BE TAKEN UP TO
THREE TIMES A DAY, YOU SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE EPHEDRA IS A STIMULANT AND
MIGHT CAUSE INSOMNIA OR RAISE BLOOD PRESSURE. SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM
OVERDOSING ON THIS HERB IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIGH, AND THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO STOP THE SALE OF EPHEDRINE SUPPLEMENTS.
EPHEDRA COULD BE GREAT FOR TREATING SOME CHILDREN'S PROBLEMS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING IT, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR PEDIATRICIAN
BEFORE USING IT. CHILDREN SHOULD BE GIVEN LESS THAN HALF OF THE AMOUNT APPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS.
V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). LIKE ECHINACEA, GARLIC AND ITS EXTRACTS
HAVE ANTIBIOTIC AND IMMUNE-BOOSTING BENEFITS. IN STUDIES, DRIPPING GARLIC OIL
DIRECTLY INTO THE EAR CANAL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO TREAT FUNGAL INFECTIONS AS WELL
AS OR BETTER THAN PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS.
TAKEN INTERNALLY, GARLIC CAN HELP CURE A MIDDLE EAR INFECTION. IF YOU HAVE
AN EARACHE, I SUGGEST ADDING MORE GARLIC TO YOUR COOKING. YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY
PUTTING A FEW DROPS OF GARLIC OIL IN THE PAINFUL EAR.
V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). THIS IS ANOTHER POTENT NATURAL
ANTIBIOTIC. SOME NATUROPATHS SUGGEST USING A MIXTURE OF ECHINACEA, GOLDENSEAL
AND LICORICE ROOT (THIS JUST FOR FLAVOR).
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA USING EITHER A TEASPOON OF EACH HERB OR A DROPPERFUL OF
EACH TINCTURE PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
ENJOY A CUP THREE TIMES A DAY.
ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE PROOF THAT
THIS MIXTURE IS SUPERIOR TO EITHER ECHINACEA OR GOLDENSEAL ALONE, I SUSPECT
THAT THE COMBINATION OF HERBS IS A
BETTER TREATMENT.
V FORSYTHIA (FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA), GENTIAN (GENTIANA OFFICINALIS) AND HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA
JAPONICA). ALL THREE OF THESE HERBS PRODUCE ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY. PRACTITIONERS
OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE OFTEN PRESCRIBE THEM IN POWDERED FORM,
SPRINKLED ON APPLESAUCE TO TREAT CHILDREN'S EAR INFECTIONS. I'VE HAD SUCH GOOD
SUCCESS WITH THIS APPROACH FOR COLDS AND FLU THAT I WOULD ALSO TRY IT FOR EARACHE. THEY ARE EASILY USED TO MAKE TEA.
V MULLEIN (VERBASCUM THAPSUS). MULLEIN FLOWERS HAVE MANY FANS,
BE GENTLE WHH EARDROPS
WARNING: THE ESSENTIAL OILS OF SEVERAL OF
THE HERBS DESCRIBED IN THIS CHAPTER CAN BE
DRIPPED INTO THE EARS TO HELP HEAL THE INFECTIONS THAT CAUSE EARACHE. IF A DOCTOR HAS
TOLD YOU THAT YOUR EARDRUM HAS BEEN PERFORATED OR YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO SUSPECT THAT
IT HAS, DO NOT USE HERBAL EARDROPS.
178
EMPHYSEM A
AND I'VE DECIDED THAT THESE PEOPLE MUST BE ON TO SOMETHING. ONE BRITISH
HERBALIST SUGGESTS PUTTING MULLEIN FLOWER OIL DROPS IN THE AFFECTED EAR.
V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). A NUMBER OF HERBALISTS SUGGEST
USING MINTS, WHICH ARE ANTISEPTIC, TO RELIEVE EARACHE. TO ME, PEPPERMINT
SOUNDS MOST PROMISING, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS MENTHOL. I WOULD SUGGEST USING IT
AS A TEA.
V TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). AROMATHERAPISTS AND MANY
HERBALISTS CONSIDER TEATREE OIL A SIGNIFICANT ANTISEPTIC WHEN APPLIED TO THE
SKIN. TRY MIXING A FEW DROPS IN VEGETABLE OIL TO MAKE EARDROPS. JUST DON'T USE
THE DROPS IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE EARDRUM HAS BEEN PERFORATED, AND
DON'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL OIL, INTERNALLY. THE OILS ARE EXTREMELY
CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MANY OF THEM CAN BE POISONOUS.
I'VE ALSO HEARD ONE ANECDOTAL REFERENCE TO PROBLEMS ARISING FROM USING TEATREE
OIL IN THE EAR, SO JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, DISCONTINUE USE IF YOU EXPERIENCE
ANY IRRITATION.
EMA
I
T'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR ME TO GET DESPERATE CALLS FROM PEOPLE WHO KNOW
ABOUT MY HERBAL EXPERTISE AND WANT HELP FOR ONE SERIOUS DISEASE OR ANOTHER. ONE SUCH CALL CAME FROM A DISTANT RELATIVE OF MINE. HER MOTHER, AGE 72,
HAD EMPHYSEMA.
, A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY HAD RECOMMENDED "FOOD-GRADE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE"
AS A WAY OF "GETTING MORE OXYGEN TO THE LUNGS." THE SICK WOMAN'S DOCTOR HIT
THE CEILING WHEN HE HEARD OF THIS. MY RELATIVE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT
OF FOOD-GRADE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, AND I HAD TO TELL HER THAT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT
IT WAS. I KNEW ONLY THAT THE LIQUID WAS A TOPICAL ANTISEPTIC AND HAIR LIGHTENER.
J I HAD A STRONG GUT FEELING THAT THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT AND THAT FOOD-GRADE
HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, WHATEVER IT WAS, WAS A BAD IDEA. I FELT I HAD GOOD REASON
FOR CONCERN. I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH ALL THE RESEARCH SHOWING THAT ANTIOXIDANTS, WHICH ABOUND IN FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, CAN HELP HEAL MANY CON-
) DITIONS, INCLUDING MANY PROBLEMS COMMON IN THE ELDERLY.
ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT NEUTRALIZE HIGHLY REACTIVE FREE RADICAL
OXYGEN MOLECULES, WHICH CAUSE CELL DAMAGE THROUGHOUT THE BODY. BUT HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IS THE OPPOSITE OF AN ANTIOXIDANT. IT'S A PRO-OXIDANT, MEANING
EMPHYS
179
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THAT IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF FREE RADICALS IN THE BODY AND MIGHT WELL INCREASE CELL DAMAGE. I WEIGHED IN ON THE SIDE OF THE PHYSICIAN AND TOLD MY RELATIVE THAT I WOULDN'T TOUCH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE, EXCEPT FOR USE AS A TOPICAL
ANTISEPTIC.
STILL, THAT INQUIRY GOT ME INTERESTED IN ANTIOXIDANTS AND EMPHYSEMA. I
CHECKED MY TRUSTY DATABASE, AND WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME INTRIGUING RESEARCH THAT ANTIOXIDANTS JUST MIGHT HELP? IT APPEARS THAT THEY HELP
PROTECT LUNG TISSUE FROM DAMAGE CAUSED BY SMOKING, WHICH IS THE UNDERLYING
CAUSE OF EMPHYSEMA.
THE DISEASE THAT LEAVES YOU BREATHLESS
EMPHYSEMA IS SLOW SUFFOCATION. THE TINY AIR SACS IN THE LUNGS (ALVEOLI)
BECOME DAMAGED AND LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER OXYGEN INTO THE BLOOD AND
CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF IT. AS A RESULT, THE LUNGS FUNCTION POORLY.
THE MAIN SYMPTOM OF EMPHYSEMA IS SHORTNESS OF BREATH, WHICH BECOMES
WORSE AS THE CONDITION BECOMES MORE SEVERE. BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT STRUGGLE
TO BREATHE, THE CHEST BECOMES BARREL-SHAPED. IN ADVANCED EMPHYSEMA, AN INDIVIDUAL MAY REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN AND BE UNABLE TO TOLERATE EVEN
SMALL AMOUNTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE CONDITION IS DIFFICULT TO TREAT AND IS
OFTEN FATAL.
EMPHYSEMA RESULTS FROM CHRONIC RESPIRATORY IRRITATION. SMOKING CAUSES
JUST ABOUT EVERY CASE, ALTHOUGH LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO DUST, AIR POLLUTANTS AND
CHEMICAL VAPORS MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE.
SMOKING ALSO CAUSES THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES OF A CLOSELY RELATED CONDITION, CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. IN CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, THE TINY HAIRS (CILIA) THAT LINE
THE RESPIRATORY TRACT LOSE THEIR ABILITY TO SWEEP OUT MUCUS. UNCLEARED MUCUS
BECOMES THICK AND STICKY, AND IT ACCUMULATES, BECOMING AN EMPHYSEMA-AGGRAVATING RESPIRATORY IRRITANT. THE COMBINATION OF EMPHYSEMA AND CHRONIC
BRONCHITIS IS KNOWN AS CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD).
GREEN PHARMACY FOR EMPHYSEMA
CLEARLY, THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH EMPHYSEMA, CHRONIC BRONCHITIS AND
COPD IS TO QUIT SMOKING. ONCE DIAGNOSED, EMPHYSEMA IS NOT REVERSIBLE. STILL,
REMAINING LUNG FUNCTION CAN BE MAXIMIZED BY AVOIDING RESPIRATORY IRRITANTS
AND BY USING SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN. IN ADDITION, HERBS THAT CAN HELP THIN
MUCUS OR CLEAR IT FROM THE LUNGS ARE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL.
V \ \ MULLEIN (VERBASCUM THAPSUS). HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL
MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND
180
EMPHYSEM A
HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, PRAISES VELVETY MULLEIN FOR ITS ABILITY TO TREAT RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EMPHYSEMA. MULLEIN IS RICH IN SOOTHING MUCILAGE.
I'VE HAD SUCH IMPRESSIVE RESULTS WITH USING MULLEIN TO TREAT COLDS, FLU AND
BRONCHITIS THAT IF I HAD EMPHYSEMA, I WOULD TRY IT.
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED, CRUSHED MULLEIN
LEAVES OR FLOWERS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STRAIN IT CAREFULLY BEFORE DRINKING IT.
DR. MOWREY ALSO RECOMMENDS A COMBINATION OF MULLEIN, RED PEPPER AND
LICORICE (DISCUSSED BELOW).
V W RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). BRITISH PHYSICIAN IRWIN
ZIMENT, M.D., URGES HIS EMPHYSEMA PATIENTS TO EAT A HOT, SPICY MEAL EVERY DAY
OR DOWN A GLASS OF WATER SPIKED WITH 10 TO
20 DROPS OF HOT-PEPPER SAUCE. THERE ARE
TWO REASONS FOR THIS. FIRST, RED PEPPER IS
A RICH SOURCE OF ANTIOXIDANTS THAT HELP
PROTECT LUNG TISSUE FROM DAMAGE AT THE
CELLULAR LEVEL. SECOND, IT HELPS THIN
MUCUS AND MOVE IT OUT OF THE RESPIRATORY
TRACT.
RED PEPPER IS FAR FROM THE ONLY SPICY
PLANT WITH EXPECTORANT VALUE. THE ANCIENTS USED AIL OF THE HOT SPICES TO THIN
MUCUS AND HELP PROPEL IT OUT OF THE LUNGS,
PARTICULARLY GARLIC, ONIONS, GINGER, MUSTARD AND HORSERADISH. FD RECOMMEND ANY
OR ALL OF THEM. IN FACT, I'VE INCLUDED MOST
OF THEM IN MY MUCOKINETIC MULE, THE TEA
WITH A KICK. (SEE PAGE 182.)
W CAMU-CAMU {MYRCIARIA DUBIA) AND OTHER HERBS RICH IN VITAMIN
C. A GOOD DEAL OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT VITAMIN C HAS MUCUS-THINNING
PROPERTIES AND HELPS TREAT ALL MANNER OF RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS. IN THAT CASE, I
MUST PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR CAMU-CAMU, THE AMAZONIAN FRUIT WITH THE WORLD'S
HIGHEST VITAMIN C CONTENT. ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS, IT IS NEARLY 4 PERCENT VITAMIN C. THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT LEMONS HAVE ONLY 0.56 PERCENT,
AND NO OTHER HIGH-C FRUIT OR VEGETABLE COMES CLOSE TO CAMU-CAMU.
THAT SAID, I MUST ADD THAT CAMU-CAMU IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE
UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH I'M WORKING ON IT AND EXPECT IT WILL BE AVAILABLE
SOMETIME WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. UNTIL YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD GROCER CARRIES
IT, FEEL FREE TO USE CITRUS FRUITS, BELL PEPPERS, GUAVA, WATERCRESS AND ALL THE
AMERICAN INDIANS USED THIS MEDICINAL SPICE, AND IT HAS CHANGED
THE CUISINES AND MEDICINE OF THE
WORLD SINCE COLUMBUS.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
OTHER HIGH-C FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.
ROSEHIPS ARE ALSO A GOOD SOURCE.
^ ^ CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM). THIS HERB IS VERY HIGH
IN CINEOLE, A POTENT EXPECTORANT COMPOUND. IF I HAD EMPHYSEMA, I'D ADD A
TEASPOON OR TWO OF POWDERED CARDAMOM TO FRUIT JUICE OR TEA.
OTHER HERBS HIGH IN CINEOLE (IN
DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY) INCLUDE
SPEARMINT, ROSEMARY, SWEET ANNIE,
GINGER, LAVENDER, NUTMEG, BEE BALM,
PEPPERMINT, TANSY, YARROW, CINNAMON,
BASIL, TURMERIC, LEMON LEAF, HYSSOP,
TARRAGON, LEMON VERBENA AND FENNEL.
EUCALYPTUS SHOULD REALLY BE AT THE TOP
OF THIS LIST, BUT I WANT TO DISCUSS THIS
HERB SEPARATELY.
VV EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS
GLOBULUS)* EUCALYPTUS OIL IS VERY
HIGH IN CINEOLE. THIS HERB, A POTENT
EXPECTORANT, IS AN INGREDIENT IN SEVERAL SORE THROAT LOZENGES AND IN COMMERCIAL CHEST RUBS.
STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE BENEFITS
OF A EUCALYPTUS CHEST RUB ARE AN ILLUSION. WHEN INHALED, EUCALYPTUS STIMULATES COLD RECEPTORS IN THE NOSE, PRODUCING A FEELING OF INCREASED AIR FLOW BUT
NO DEMONSTRABLE DECONGESTANT ACTIVITY.
OTHER STUDIES, HOWEVER, SHOW THAT CINEOLE HAS BOTH EXPECTORANT AND DECONGESTANT ACTIVITY WHEN INGESTED. PERSONALLY, I'D FORGET THE CHEST RUBS AND
GO WITH A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED, CRUSHED LEAVES PER CUP
OF BOILING WATER. DRINK UP TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE CONTAINS NINE EXPECTORANT
COMPOUNDS PLUS TEN ANTIOXIDANT COMPOUNDS. IF I HAD EMPHYSEMA, I'D ADD AN
OCCASIONAL TEASPOON OF SWEET, POWDERED LICORICE ROOT TO HERBAL BEVERAGE TEAS.
(WHILE LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—
UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY—LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF LARGER
AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.)
MUCOKINETIC MULE
THIS EMPHYSEMA TEA KICKS LIKE A MULE,
SO BE CAREFUL HOW MUCH OF THE INGREDIENTS
YOU USE. A MUCOKINETIC HERB, BY THE WAY,
IS ONE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE MUCUS
UP AND OUT OF THE LUNGS. MOST OF THE HERBS
IN THIS TEA ARE MUCOKINETIC.
START WITH SMALL AMOUNTS OF HERBS
AND ADD MORE ONLY IF YOUR SINUSES AND
TASTE BUDS CAN HANDLE IT. THE HERBS TO USE
ARE GARLIC, GINGER, HOT PEPPER, HORSERADISH
AND MUSTARD; STEEP THEM IN TWO CUPS OF
BOILING WATER FOR TEN MINUTES. YOU CAN
ADD A BIT OF FRUIT THAT CONTAINS VITAMIN C,
SUCH AS LEMON OR ORANGE.
DRINK THIS TEA SLOWLY AND WITH CAUTION! IT WILL BE VERY HOT AND COULD TRIGGER
GAGGING. IF YOU CAN TOLERATE IT, HOWEVER, IT
WILL HELP UNPLUG THAT MUCUS AND GET IT
FLOWING. IF YOU JUST CAN'T GET IT DOWN, DON'T
FORCE IT. INSTEAD, TRY SOME OF THE OTHER
HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER.

CAPSULE, BUT DO NOT INGEST THE OIL, WHICH IS FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.

EXPERT PANEL THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES FOR
THE GERMAN COUNTERPART OF THE FDA, RECOMMENDS ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF
SENECA SNAKEROOT TINCTURE AS AN EXPECTORANT. THIS HERB IS USEFUL IN TREATING EMPHYSEMA AND BRONCHITIS, ACCORDING TO NORMAN BISSET, PH.D., PROFESSOR OF PHARMACY AT KING'S COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL DRUGS
AND PHYTOPHARMACEUTICALS.
V BASIL (OCIMUM BASILICUM). ALTHOUGH BASIL IS NOT WIDELY KNOWN AS
AN EXPECTORANT, IT DOES CONTAIN SIX COMPOUNDS THAT ARE USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE.
I PERSONALLY LIKE PESTO SO MUCH THAT I THOUGHT FD MENTION THIS HERB. PESTO IS
THAT WONDERFULLY FLAVORFUL PASTA SAUCE MADE WITH GARLIC AND FRESH BASIL, AND IN
MY OPINION IT'S A PARTICULARLY NICE WAY TO GET A MEDICINAL DOSE OF BOTH HERBS.
V ELECAMPANE (INULA HELENIUM). WITH RESPECTED BRITISH HERBALIST
DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, REPORTING EXPECTORANT AND
LUNG-PROTECTIVE BENEFITS FOR THIS HERB, I WOULD PROBABLY USE IT IF I HAD EMPHYSEMA. TRY ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED, CRUSHED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
DRINK UP TO TWO CUPS A DAY. ELECAMPANE IS BITTER, SO YOU CAN ADD LEMON,
LICORICE AND HONEY TO TASTE, OR MAKE A TEA OF MIXED HERBS WITH ANY OF THE OTHER
HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER.
V OREGANO (ORIGANUM VULGARE). OREGANO CONTAINS SIX COMPOUNDS
THAT ARE EXPECTORANTS. LIKE BASIL, IT'S NOT WIDELY KNOWN AS AN EXPECTORANT, BUT
ALSO LIKE BASIL, IT'S A WONDERFUL CULINARY HERB.
V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). SPEAKING OF EXPECTORANT TEAS, REGULAR OLD
GREEN OR BLACK TEA CONTAINS SIX EXPECTORANT COMPOUNDS AND ONE, THEOPHYLLINE,
THAT CAN HELP MUCUS MOVE UP FROM DEEPER IN THE LUNGS. IT ALSO CONTAINS SOME
CAFFEINE, WHICH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN HAS SOME ANTIDEPRESSANT VALUE. THAT AND
ITS STIMULANT EFFECT MIGHT HELP PEOPLE WITH EMPHYSEMA FEEL BETTER.
183
ENDOMETRIOSIS
I
N WOMEN WHO HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS, TISSUE CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE UTERINE
LINING (THE ENDOMETRIUM) GROWS OUTSIDE THE UTERUS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN
THE PELVIC CAVITY. THIS TISSUE SWELLS AND BLEEDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A WOMAN'S
MONTHLY MENSTRUAL CYCLE. ENDOMETRIOSIS MAY CAUSE PAIN, NAUSEA, HEAVY MENSTRUAL BLEEDING, PAIN DURING INTERCOURSE AND IN SOME CASES, INFERTILITY.
ESTIMATES VARY ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF ENDOMETRIOSIS, BUT MOST AUTHORITIES SUGGEST THAT 2 TO 5 PERCENT OF WOMEN MAY HAVE THIS CONDITION. IT'S MOST
LIKELY TO SHOW UP BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 40.
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, NEITHER MAINSTREAM NOR NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS CAN CLAIM
MUCH SUCCESS IN TREATING ENDOMETRIOSIS. MAINSTREAM DOCTORS OFTEN PRESCRIBE
SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN, USUALLY IN THE FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS. AND NATUROPATHS
HAVE FAVORED HERBS AND FOODS WITH NATURAL PLANT HORMONES (PHYTOESTROGENS)
THAT ARE RELATED TO THE ESTROGENS. PHYTOESTROGENS ARE MUCH LESS POTENT THAN THE
BODY'S OWN ESTROGENS. THEY ACTUALLY BLOCK THE BODY'S ESTROGEN RECEPTOR SITES,
THEREBY REDUCING THE EFFECT OF A WOMAN'S OWN HORMONES.
THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF ENDOMETRIOSIS. ACCORDING TO SOME SOURCES, EVIDENCE LINKS IT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM DAMAGE CAUSED
BY ESTROGEN-LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PESTICIDES. OTHER
IMMUNE-SUPPRESSING DRUGS AND TOXINS MAY BE EQUALLY SUSPECT. SOME EXPERTS
ALSO SPECULATE THAT USING TAMPONS, IUDS OR THE CONTRACEPTIVE CAP MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISK OF DEVELOPING ENDOMETRIOSIS. APPARENTLY NO ONE KNOWS FOR
SURE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS
IF YOU'RE BATTLING ENDOMETRIOSIS, VARIOUS AUTHORITIES SUGGEST AVOIDING ALCOHOL, CAFFEINE, WHOLE-MILK DAIRY PRODUCTS, EGGS, FRIED FOODS, RED MEAT, SALT AND
SUGAR. I CAN'T SWEAR THAT ANY OF THESE DIETARY CHANGES WILL HELP, BUT THEY MAKE
GOOD SENSE EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS.
AND ALTHOUGH I DON'T PROMISE THAT ANY NATURAL HERBAL ALTERNATIVES WILL CURE
ENDOMETRIOSIS, I BELIEVE THAT THE ONES DESCRIBED BELOW MAY HELP. THEY ARE
SAFE, AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE WORTH A TRY.
W * SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MUX) AND OTHER BEANS. MANY IN THE NATURAL MEDICINE CAMP HAVE EMBRACED SOY PRODUCTS FOR TREATING ENDOMETRIOSIS AND OTHER AILMENTS, NOTABLY BREAST CANCER, THAT ARE RELATED TO ESTROGEN.
THE SOY SUPPORTERS TOUT SOYBEANS BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGH IN TWO ESTROGEN184
ENDOMETRIOSIS
SOYBEANS
SOYBEANS SHARE GREAT MEDICINAL
POTENTIAL WITH OTHER EDIBLE LEGUMES.
LIKE PLANT COMPOUNDS, GENISTEIN AND
DAIDZEIN. BOTH OF THESE PHYTOESTROGENS PREVENT YOUR BODY FROM TAKING
UP THE MORE HARMFUL FORMS OF ESTROGEN
CIRCULATING IN YOUR BLOOD. THEY TAKE
THE PLACE OF THAT ESTROGEN, BINDING TO
YOUR CELLS' ESTROGEN RECEPTOR SITES AND
PREVENTING MORE HARMFUL ESTROGENS
FROM BINDING TO THE SAME RECEPTORS.
SIGNIFICANTLY, THEY ALSO PROTECT THE
BODY FROM POLLUTANTS THAT CHEMICALLY
MIMIC ESTROGEN.
THE SOY SUPPORTERS ARE RIGHT. SOY
IS HIGH IN GENISTEIN AND DAIDZEIN, BUT LOTS OF OTHER BEANS ARE ALSO QUITE HIGH IN
GENISTEIN, WHICH APPEARS TO BE THE MORE ACTIVE OF THE TWO PHYTOESTROGENS.
I PREDICT THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE BEEN CLAIMING THAT
SOY IS A UNIQUE SOURCE OF GENISTEIN WILL STOP DOING SO. I ALSO PREDICT THAT THERE
WILL BE MORE EMPHASIS ON BEAN SPROUTS. AS BEANS GERMINATE, THEIR GENISTEIN
CONTENT (AND THE TOTAL PHYTOESTROGEN CONTENT) INCREASES. AND IF THE SPROUTS HAVE
FUNGI (AS MANY HOMEGROWN SPROUTS DO), THE GENISTEIN CONTENT MAY INCREASE AS
MUCH AS A HUNDREDFOLD.
PINTO BEANS HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH GENISTEIN AND DAIDZEIN AS SOYBEANS.
ALSO, CONSIDER THAT SOME BEANS THAT DON'T HAVE AS MUCH DAIDZEIN AS SOYBEANS
HAVE QUITE A BIT MORE GENISTEIN. THESE INCLUDE YELLOW SPLIT PEAS, BLACK TURTLE
BEANS, LIMA BEANS, ANASAZI BEANS, RED KIDNEY BEANS AND RED LENTILS. ALSO QUITE
HIGH IN GENISTEIN ARE BLACK-EYED PEAS, MUNG BEANS, ADZUKI BEANS AND FAVA
BEANS. OUR ANALYSIS OF SCURFY PEAS SHOWED THAT THEY HAVE 50 TIMES MORE GENISTEIN THAN SOYBEANS.
IF YOU HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS, I'D SUGGEST EATING AS MANY EDIBLE BEANS AS POSSIBLE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. ALSO USE GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF BEAN SPROUTS IN YOUR
SALADS AND BE SURE TO EAT LOTS OF BEAN SOUPS, BAKED BEANS AND MEXICAN BEAN
FOODS LIKE BURRITOS. I ENJOY ALL OF THESE MORE THAN TOFU.
W FLAX (LINIUN USITATIS&IMUM). FLAXSEED CONTAINS GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF
COMPOUNDS CALLED LIGNANS, WHICH HELP CONTROL ENDOMETRIAL (AND MAYBE BREAST)
CANCER. ENDOMETRIOSIS IS NOT THE SAME AS ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, BUT BECAUSE BOTH
INVOLVE UNCONTROLLED GROWTH OF ENDOMETRIAL TISSUE, I'D SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY
FLAXSEED FOR PREVENTING OR TREATING ENDOMETRIOSIS.
FLAXSEED MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR ANYONE WHO IS NOT A VEGETARIAN.
VEGETARIANS HAVE HIGH BLOOD AND URINE LEVELS OF LIGNANS, WHILE EATING MEAT
185
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SUPPRESSES LIGNANS SUBSTANTIALLY. SO IF YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO MEAT IN YOUR DIET, YOU
MAY NEED AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF LIGNAN TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS SUPPRESSANT EFFECT.
SOME BREADS CONTAIN GROUND FLAXSEED; CHECK LABELS. I'VE ALSO GROUND THE
SEED MYSELF AND ADDED IT TO CORNBREAD BATTER. I SUGGEST YOU EXPERIMENT WITH
FINDING WAYS TO GET FLAXSEED INTO YOUR DIET ON A REGULAR BASIS.
W PEANUT (ARACHU HYPOGAEA). I LOVE PEANUTS. I MUNCH SOME JUST ABOUT
EVERY DAY, AND I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR STUDIES THAT SHOW THEY CONFER HEALTH ADVANTAGES. WHEN PEANUTS ARE ANALYZED, IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY CONTAIN MANY OF THE
SAME HEALTHFUL SUBSTANCES AS SOYBEANS AND OTHER BEANS.
GIVEN TWO FOODS WITH EQUAL POTENTIAL FOR HEALTH BENEFITS, THE ONE YOU ENJOY
SHOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU. THAT'S ASSUMING, AS IMMUNOLOGISTS CLAIM, THAT PLEASURE IS GOOD FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. AND LET'S FACE IT, WHO DOESN'T PREFER PEANUTS
TO SOYBEANS?
THERE'S AN EXTRA BONUS TO BE HAD IF YOU SELECT SPANISH PEANUTS. THE PAPERY
RED MEMBRANE AROUND SPANISH PEANUTS IS THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS), SUBSTANCES THAT ALSO MAY HELP CONTROL HORMONE-DEPENDENT
CANCERS AND POSSIBLY ENDOMETRIOSIS.
^ ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SALIVA). ALFALFA SPROUTS CONTAIN PHYTOESTROGENS, SO
USE THEM LIBERALLY ON SALADS. EVEN IF THEY DON'T RELIEVE ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE GREEN VEGETABLES, AND EATING MORE VEGETABLES LOWERS CANCER RISK.
IF YOU HAVE LUPUS OR A FAMILY HISTORY OF LUPUS, HOWEVER, STEER CLEAR OF ALFALFA
SPROUTS. THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY MAY TRIGGER LUPUS IN SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.
V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). I THINK OF EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO) MORE AS A TREATMENT FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME
(PMS) THAN FOR ENDOMETRIOSIS. (FOR MORE INFORMATION ON EPO AND PMS, SEE PAGE
364.) BUT THE NATURAL MEDICINE GUIDES I TRUST MENTION IT ALMOST AS OFTEN AS FLAXSEED
AND SOY FOR TREATING THIS CONDITION. EPO CONTAINS GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID AND TRYPTOPHAN, BOTH SUBSTANCES THAT SEEM TO PROMOTE GENERAL GOOD HEALTH IN WOMEN.
ERECTION PROBLEMS
N
OT LONG AGO, DOCTORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS BELIEVED THAT 90 PERCENT OF
ERECTION DIFFICULTIES WERE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND THAT A STIMULATING PARTNER
WAS ALL A MAN NEEDED. NOW AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT MOST ERECTION IMPAIRMENT
186
ERECTIO N PROBLEM S
HAS A PHYSICAL CAUSE: CLOGGED ARTERIES, ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUGS, DIABETES, PELVIC
INJURIES, SLEEP DEPRIVATION, SMOKING OR PROSTATE SURGERY.
BUT HOW CAN A MAN KNOW IF HIS ERECTION PROBLEM IS PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL? I LIKE THE POSTAGE-STAMP TEST MENTIONED BY HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL,
M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND
AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE. IT IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING MAN HAS SPONTANEOUS ERECTIONS IN HIS SLEEP EVERY NIGHT.
TO TAKE THIS TEST, FASTEN A STRIP OF POSTAGE STAMPS AROUND THE SHAFT OF YOUR
PENIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED. IF THE STRIP IS INTACT IN THE MORNING, YOU HAVE NOT
HAD ANY ERECTIONS DURING SLEEP, AND THERE IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WRONG PHYSICALLY. IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, A NIGHTTIME ERECTION BROKE THE STAMPS AS YOU SLEPT,
YOUR PENIS IS WORKING OKAY, AND THE PROBLEM MAY WELL BE PSYCHOLOGICAL.
THIS TEST IS NOT FOOLPROOF, BUT IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START. THE NEXT LOGICAL
STEP, OF COURSE, IS TO DISCUSS THE RESULTS WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
IMPOTENCE IS THE INABILITY TO RAISE OR SUSTAIN AN ERECTION THAT IS ADEQUATE
FOR INTERCOURSE AND EJACULATION. SOME 30 MILLION AMERICAN MEN EXPERIENCE
SOME FORM OF IMPOTENCE, WITH MORE THAN A MILLION CURRENTLY BEING TREATED.
SOME TAKE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. OTHERS GET PENILE IMPLANTS. THE NEWEST
APPROACH INVOLVES SELF-INJECTING A HORMONE KNOWN AS PROSTAGLANDIN E. WITHIN
A FEW MINUTES, IT PRODUCES A 90-MINUTE ERECTION.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ERECTION PROBLEMS
BUT BEFORE YOU GO STICKING NEEDLES INTO YOUR PENIS, YOU MIGHT TRY SOME OF
THESE HERBAL APPROACHES.
VVV FAVA BEAN (VICIA FABA). ALLEGED TO HAVE INCITED THE ANCIENT ROMAN
POET CICERO TO PASSION, THE FAVA BEAN IS OUR BEST FOOD SOURCE OF THE COMPOUND LDOPA, WHICH IS OFTEN USED TO TREAT PARKINSON'S DISEASE. LARGE AMOUNTS OF L-DOPA
MAY CAUSE PRIAPISM, A PAINFUL, PERSISTENT ERECTION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
SEXUAL AROUSAL.
I WOULDN'T ADVOCATE DOSES OF L-DOPA LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE PRIAPISM, BUT
V YOU'D BE HARD PUT TO EAT ENOUGH FAVA BEANS TO EVER CAUSE A PROBLEM. FAVA
BEANS HAVE AN AGE-OLD REPUTATION AS AN APHRODISIAC. I SUSPECT THAT A BIG
SERVING—8 TO 16 OUNCES—JUST MIGHT CONTAIN ENOUGH ENOUGH L-DOPA TO GIVE
ERECTION A NICE BOOST.
IF FAVA BEANS SEEM TO HELP, TRY SPROUTING THEM. THE SPROUTS CONTAIN EVEN MORE
L-DOPA.
W * , GINKGO {GINKGO BUOBA). GINKGO IS BEST KNOWN FOR IMPROVING BLOOD
;
 FLOW THROUGH THE BRAIN. BUT IT ALSO SEEMS TO BOOST BLOOD FLOW INTO THE PENIS, THUS
) AIDING IFFY ERECTIONS.
187
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
IN SEVERAL SMALL STUDIES, PHYSICIANS HAVE OBTAINED VERY GOOD RESULTS WITH
60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS DAILY OF A STANDARDIZED GINKGO EXTRACT. IN ONE NINE-MONTH
STUDY, 78 PERCENT OF MEN WITH IMPOTENCE DUE TO ATHEROSCLEROTIC CLOGGING OF THE
PENILE ARTERY REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS.
PEOPLE NORMALLY THINK OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS AS A DISEASE THAT CLOGS THE BLOOD
VESSELS THAT SUPPLY THE HEART, THEREBY LEADING TO HEART ATTACKS. THIS SAME DISEASE CAN ALSO CLOG THE BLOOD VESSELS THAT SUPPLY THE PENIS AND LEAD TO ERECTION
PROBLEMS.
IN ANOTHER SIX-MONTH STUDY, HALF OF THE MEN BEING TREATED WITH GINKGO REGAINED THEIR ERECTIONS. THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS ARE TOO DILUTE IN GINKGO LEAVES
TO DO MUCH GOOD, SO STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS CONCENTRATE IT: A 50:1 EXTRACT MEANS
THAT 50 POUNDS OF LEAVES WERE USED TO PRODUCE 1 POUND OF EXTRACT. THESE EXTRACTS ARE AVAILABLE AT MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES AND HERB SHOPS.
YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT.
IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS. AND
DO GIVE IT TIME TO WORK. IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS, YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO
DO THE TRICK.
V^V VELVET BEAN (MUCUNA, VARIOUS SPECIES). YEARS AGO, WHILE WORKING IN
PANAMA, I WAS TOLD BY MORE THAN ONE INFORMANT THAT THE SEEDS OF THE VELVET OR OXEYE BEAN (IN SPANISH, OJO DE BUEY) WERE APHRODISIAC. THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW THATHESE SEEDS CAN CONTAIN AS MUCH L-DOPA AS FAVA BEANS, AND PERHAPS MORE.
W%> YOHIMBE (PAUSINYSTALIA YOHIMBE). FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS, I HAVE
MAINTAINED THAT IF THERE IS A REAL HERBAL ERECTION ENHANCER, YOHIMBE IS IT. I BASED
THIS ON CENTURIES OF FOLKLORE ABOUT THE AFRICAN TREE BARK AND A FEW SMALL CLINICAL
TRIALS THAT SHOWED THAT THE HERB PRODUCED ERECTIONS IN ABOUT HALF OF MEN WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPOTENCE AND ABOUT 40 PERCENT WITH PHYSICAL ERECTION PROBLEMS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE A LITTLE UNNERVING, INCLUDING ANXIETY,
INCREASED HEART RATE, ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE, FLUSHING, HALLUCINATIONS AND
HEADACHE. THIS IS NOT AN HERB THAT YOU WANT TO MESS AROUND WITH.
BUT THEN THE DRUG COMPANIES GOT INTO THE ACT. THEY FIGURED OUT HOW TO EXTRACT THE ACTIVE COMPOUND AND EVENTUALLY WON APPROVAL FOR YOHIMBINE HYDROCHLORIDE (YOCON, YOHIMEX) AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. AFTER ONE MONTH,
14 PERCENT OF MEN TAKING IT REPORTED RESTORATION OF FULL AND SUSTAINED ERECTIONS,
20 PERCENT REPORTED PARTIAL RESPONSES, AND 65 PERCENT REPORTED NO IMPROVEMENT. STILL, ONE-THIRD IMPROVED, WHICH ISN'T BAD.
GENERALLY, I ADVOCATE TAKING A WHOLE HERB RATHER THAN A PHARMACEUTICAL
DERIVATIVE, BUT THIS IS AN EXCEPTION TO MY RULE. COMPARED WITH THE RAW HERB,
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG CAUSES FEWER SIDE EFFECTS, AND THOSE ARE GENERALLY BENIGN.
IF I HAD ERECTION DIFFICULTIES, I MIGHT ASK MY DOCTOR TO PUT ME ON YOHIMBINE.
188
ERECTION PROBLEMS
R 1
SHU DRINKS FOR BELTER PERFORMANCE
I DO A LOT OF TRAVELING IN LATIN AMERICA, AND THE HERBAL FORMULAS I FIND THERE—AND
PEOPLE'S FAITH IN THEM—NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME.
WHEN IT COMES TO ENHANCING MEN'S SEXUAL POTENCY, THERE IS A VERY LONG LIST OF
HERBS WITH A REPUTATION FOR DELIVERING. I FIND A COUPLE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES MADE
FROM HERBAL FORMULAS ADDED TO A WINE OR RUM BASE TO BE PARTICULARLY INTRIGUING.
ONE IS SIETE RAICES. IN ENGLISH THIS TRANSLATES TO "SEVEN ROOTS," WHICH IS RATHER
ODD, BECAUSE THE DRINK IS MADE FROM SEVEN DRIED BARKS. THE OTHER IS ROMPE CALZON—
"BUST YOUR BRITCHES." THE NAME COMES FROM ITS FOLKLORE REPUTATION FOR PRODUCING
ERECTIONS LARGE ENOUGH TO STRAIN TROUSER MATERIAL. (I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.)
THERE IS ONLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT ROMPE CALZON STIMULATES EROTIC INTEREST,
BUT THOSE ANECDOTES SURE SELL A LOT OF THIS BREW IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. I CONFESS THAT I'VE TRIED IT MYSELF AND HAVEN'T FOUND IT ALL THAT STIMULATING.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BUY EITHER OF THESE FORMULAS IN THE STATES, BUT ONE INGREDIENT COMMON TO BOTH MAY BE AVAILABLE HERE. CLAVOHUASCA (TYNNANTHUS PANURENSIS) IS AN AROMATIC VINE THAT IS OFTEN FOUND CLIMBING TO THE FOREST CANOPY IN
AMAZONIAN PERU, WHERE I LEAD MY RAINFOREST PHARMACY WORKSHOPS.
ONE TRAVELER IN MY FIRST PHYSICIAN'S WORKSHOP, AN ACCLAIMED HERBALIST HIMSELF, SAYS HE HAS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT TINCTURE OF CLAVOHUASCA, A RATHER PLEASANT
AND WARMING LIQUEUR, SEXUALLY EXCITES BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE OF THE HUMAN
SPECIES—NAMELY HIM AND HIS WIFE.
I KNOW OF ONLY ONE HERB SHOP IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CARRIES TINCTURE OF
CLAVOHUASCA, SMILE HERB SHOP IN COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND, SO I'M ASSUMING THAT
IT'S IMPORTED AND CAN BE FOUND IN OTHER HERB SHOPS. IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO GIVE IT A
TRY, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT—BUT YOU'D HAVE TO WORK A WHOLE LOT HARDER TO
GET YOUR HANDS ON EITHER SIETE RAICES OR ROMPE CALZON.
I — J
"W ANISE (PIMPINELLA ANISUM). ANISE CONTAINS SEVERAL COMPOUNDS THAT
ARE ESTROGENIC, SO IT MIGHT SEEM AN UNLIKELY HERB FOR ERECTION PROBLEMS. ESTROGEN
IS A FEMALE HORMONE, AND A NUMBER OF PLANTS CONTAIN SUBSTANCES THAT ACT UKE THIS
HORMONE IN THE BODY. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED ESTROGENIC. ODDLY ENOUGH, THOUGH,
SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED ESTROGENIC HERBS REPORT ANDROGENIC (MALE SEX HORMONE) EFFECTS AS WELL. AND ANISE HAS A REPUTATION FOR INCREASING MALE LIBIDO.
I THINK ANISE IS WORTH A TRY, WHICH IS WHY IT'S AN INGREDIENT IN MY ERECTOR
SET TEA: COMBINE TO TASTE A DASH OR TWO OF ANISE, CARDAMOM, EPIMEDIUM, GINGER
AND GINSENG. SWEETEN WITH LICORICE ROOT.
VV CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM). THIS HERB CONTAINS AT LEAST
TWO ANDROGENIC COMPOUNDS. FOR CENTURIES, ARAB CULTURES HAVE HELD THIS SPICE
189
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IN HIGH ESTEEM AS AN APHRODISIAC, THUS ARAB COFFEE HOUSES OFTEN MIX SOME INTO
COFFEE.
WHAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR CARDAMOM'S APHRODISIAC REPUTATION? IN MY DATABASE, CARDAMOM SHOWS UP AS THE BEST SOURCE OF THE COMPOUND CINEOLE. CINEOLE
IS A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULANT, AND PEOPLE HAVE A WAY OF THINKING THAT
ANY STIMULATION IS SEXUAL STIMULATION. IT PROBABLY CAN'T HURT TO SPIKE YOUR
COFFEE OR TEA WITH A LITTLE CARDAMOM, THOUGH, AND THIS HERB TASTES GOOD, TOO.
VV CINNAMON (CINNAMOMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALAN HIRSCH, M.D., DIRECTOR OF THE SMELL AND TASTE RESEARCH FOUNDATION IN CHICAGO, ATTACHED MEASUREMENT DEVICES TO THE PENISES OF MEDICAL STUDENTS TO TEST THEIR REACTIONS TO VARIOUS
AROMAS. THE SMELL OF HOT CINNAMON BUNS GENERATED THE MOST BLOOD FLOW, HENCE SUGGESTING THE MOST HELP FOR ERECTIONS. A COMBINATION OF THE AROMAS OF PUMPKIN PIE
(PUMPKIN PLUS NUTMEG) AND LAVENDER ALSO STIMULATED PENILE BLOOD FLOW.
OKAY, I KNOW THAT ALL OF THIS SOUNDS SOMEWHAT FAR-FETCHED, BUT THESE ARE
VALID SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW DO YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
RESEARCH? WELL, IF THE WAY TO A MAN'S HEART REALLY IS
THROUGH HIS STOMACH—AND YOU WANT TO GET
SOMEWHERE ELSE AS WELL—WHY NOT GIVE
HIM CINNAMON BUNS AND PUMPKIN
PIE?
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE).
IN AN ARTICLE TITLED "STUDIES ON HERBAL
APHRODISIACS USED IN THE ARAB SYSTEM OF
MEDICINE" PUBLISHED IN THE AMERICAN
JOURNAL OF CHINESE MEDICINE, SOME SAUDI
SCIENTISTS ASSERTED THAT GINGER EXTRACTS
SIGNIFICANDY INCREASE SPERM MOTILITY AND
QUANTITY.
GINGER, A BOTANICALLY CLOSE RELATIVE
OF CARDAMOM, CERTAINLY HAS A PIQUANT
TASTE, AND MAYBE IT STIRS ENOUGH SEXUAL
INTEREST TO HELP A FLAGGING ERECTION. I
MAKE NO PROMISES, BUT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR FOLK MEDICAL TRADITIONS, WHICH
IS WHY I INCLUDE BOTH GINGER AND CARDAMOM IN MY ERECTOR SET TEA.
W GINSENG (PANAX*, VARIOUS
SPECIES). AMERICAN GINSENG (P. QUINQUEFOLIUS) IS PROBABLY NORTH AMERICA'S
AMERICAN GINSENG
FIRST DISCOVERED IN SOUTHERN CANADA
BY A FRENCH EXPLORER,, AMERICAN GINSENG IS AN EXPENSIVE, RARE HERB THAT
WAS SAID TO "INVIGORATE THE VIRILE
POWERS."
190
ERECTIO N PROBLEM S
MOST FAMOUS—AND PERHAPS MOST OVERRATED—APHRODISIAC. EVEN THOUGH STUDIES
HAVE SHOWN THAT ANIMALS INCREASE THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY WHEN THEY EAT GINSENG, I'M
NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT THIS HERB WILL SPARK ANYONE'S FIRE.
STILL, I GROW SEVERAL VARIETIES—AMERICAN, ASIAN (P. GINSENG) AND SIBERIAN
(ELEUTHEROCOCCUS SENTICOSUS), WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS ELEUTHERO. I'M NOT CURRENTLY
USING ANY OF THESE HERBS, HOWEVER, AS THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. BUT I AM PREPARING FOR
OLD AGE BY HOLDING SOME IN RESERVE JUST IN CASE THE CHINESE ARE CORRECT IN SAYING
THAT GINSENG MAKES AN OLD MAN YOUNG AGAIN. AMERICA, BY THE WAY, EXPORTS CLOSE
TO $100 MILLION WORTH OF GINSENG ANNUALLY, MOSTLY TO ASIANS WHO HAVE GREAT FAITH
IN AMERICAN GINSENG AND REGARD IT AS THE HERBAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.
^ ^ MUIRA PUAMA {PTYCHOPETALUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THERE IS ONE
STUDY SHOWING THAT THIS HTTLE-KNOWN AMAZONIAN TREE "MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN RESTORING
LIBIDO AND TREATING ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION," ACCORDING TO MELVIN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES,
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, AND NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIAN MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., WHO CITED
THE STUDY IN THEIR BOOK BOTANICAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS. OF 262 MEN TAKING 1 TO 2.5
GRAMS (½ TO 1¼ TEASPOONS) OF MUIRA PUAMA EXTRACT A DAY FOR TWO WEEKS, 51 PERCENT OF THOSE WITH ERECTION PROBLEMS REPORTED IMPROVEMENT, AS DID 62 PERCENT OF
THOSE WITH LOSS OF LIBIDO. I CONFESS I HAVEN'T REVIEWED THE ORIGINAL STUDY, BUT IF I
HAD AN ERECTION PROBLEM, I MIGHT TRY THIS HERB. YOU CAN FIND IT IN SOME HERB STORES.
SO FAR I HAVE SEEN NO REPORTS OF SIDE EFFECTS. (SOME MEN FIND THE AMAZONIAN LADIES
SO ATTRACTIVE AS TO RENDER THE MUIRA PUAMA SUPERFLUOUS.)
W OAT (AVENA SALIVA). STALLIONS THAT ARE FED WILD OATS SUPPOSEDLY
BECOME FRISKIER AND LIBIDINOUS, WHICH IS WHERE WE GOT THE PHRASE "SOWING
WILD OATS." SOME STUDIES SUGGEST THAT OATS ARE A SEXUAL STIMULANT FOR THE
HUMAN MALE AS WELL. ESTEEMED CALIFORNIA HERBALIST KATHI KEVILLE, AUTHOR OF
THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR HEALTH AND HEALING, INCLUDES THE HERB IN THE TEA SHE RECOMMENDS TO MEN: A HALF-OUNCE EACH OF
WILD OATS, GINKGO LEAVES, GINSENG ROOT, YOHIMBE BARK AND DAMIANA LEAVES.
I'D RECOMMEND THE SAME, BUT LEAVE OUT THE YOHIMBE BARK, FOR THE REASONS
I'VE GIVEN PREVIOUSLY. (IF YOU WANT THE EFFECTS OF YOHIMBE BARK, ASK YOUR
DOCTOR FOR A PRESCRIPTION FOR YOHIMBINE INSTEAD.) STEEP THIS MIXTURE IN A PINT
OR TWO OF BOILING WATER, THEN LET IT COOL BEFORE DRINKING.
VV QUEBRACHO (ASPIDOSPERMA QUEBRACHO-BIANCO). IN SOUTH
AMERICA, THIS HERB, WHICH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION INCLUDES ON ITS LIST
OF HERBS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE, IS CONSIDERED A MALE APHRODISIAC. IT DOES
CONTAIN THE PROVEN ERECTION-RAISING COMPOUND YOHIMBINE, BUT FM LEERY OF THE
HERB YOHIMBE FOR THE REASONS I'VE GIVEN PREVIOUSLY. IF YOU DO USE IT, MAKE A TEA BY
STEEPING ABOUT FIVE TEASPOONS OF BARK PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND SWEETEN IT WITH
191
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
LICORICE ROOT. BUT DON'T TRY THIS HERB IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND IF YOU
EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS, SUCH AS DIZZINESS, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
VV WOLFBERRY (LYCIUM CHINESE). CAN THE WOLFBERRY MAKE A YOUNG WOLF
OUT OF AN OLD MAN? IN ONE STUDY, MEN OVER AGE 59 ATE ABOUT TWO OUNCES (50
GRAMS) OF WOLFBERRIES A DAY FOR TEN DAYS AND CAME AWAY WITH SIGNIFICANTLY
RAISED TESTOSTERONE LEVELS. RAISING TESTOSTERONE BOOSTS MALE SEXUALITY ONLY IN
CASES OF A DEFICIENCY OF THIS MALE HORMONE, BUT SOME ELDERLY MEN DO BECOME
DEFICIENT. PERHAPS THAT'S WHY THE CHINESE CONSIDER WOLFBERRIES TO HAVE ANTIAGING PROPERTIES.
V ASHWAGANDA (WITHANIA SOMNIFERA). PRACTITIONERS OF AYURVEDIC
MEDICINE, THE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE OF INDIA, REGARD THIS ROOT AS THE INDIAN ANSWER TO GINSENG FOR THE MALE LIBIDO. ASHWAGANDA, THEY CLAIM, CAN HELP TREAT
IMPOTENCE AND MALE INFERTILITY. BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TAKING THIS PARTICULAR HERB EVERY DAY—JUST OCCASIONALLY. TRY A CUP OR TWO OF TEA MADE WITH FIVE
TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V COUNTRY MALLOW (SIDA CORDIFOLIA). HERE'S ANOTHER STIMULANT HERB
WITH A FOLK REPUTATION AS AN ERECTION-ENHANCING APHRODISIAC. ITS STIMULANT COMPOUND IS EPHEDRINE, THE SAME ONE FOUND IN CHINESE EPHEDRA, THE DECONGESTANT,
ANTI-ASTHMA HERB. COUNTRY MALLOW CONTAINS SOME 850 PARTS PER MILLION OF
EPHEDRINE, WHICH PROBABLY EXPLAINS ITS USE FOR IMPOTENCE. AS WITH CAFFEINE,
EPHEDRINE CAN GET YOU WIRED, AND SOME MEN EXPERIENCE THAT AS SEXUAL AROUSAL.
V GUARANA (PAULLINIA CUP ANA). BRAZILIANS DRINK GALLONS OF GUARANA
TEA AND GUARANA SOFT DRINKS AND OFTEN MENTION IT AS AN APHRODISIAC. THE REASON
IS THAT THIS HERB CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF CAFFEINE, AND TRADITIONALLY, ANY STIMULANT EVENTUALLY CAME TO BE VIEWED AS A SEXUAL STIMULANT. DRINK GUARANA IF YOU
LIKE, TRY A FEW TEASPOONS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER, THEN SEE HOW AMOROUS YOU
FEEL. (YOU COULD SIMPLY DRINK SOME COFFEE, TEA, COKE OR PEPSI, BUT THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAVE THE SAME EXOTIC APPEAL. WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL ENHANCEMENT,
ANYTHING THAT ENGAGES YOUR MIND IN THE PROCESS CAN PROVE HELPFUL.)
V SAW PALMETTO (SERENOA REP ENS). THIS SMALL PALM TREE NATIVE TO THE
SOUTHEAST HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HELP SHRINK ENLARGED PROSTATE TISSUE. BUT A CENTURY AGO, IT WAS ALSO CONSIDERED USEFUL FOR TREATING IMPOTENCE AND LOSS OF LIBIDO. THE MAIN EFFECT OF SAW PALMETTO IS THAT IT SHRINKS THE PROSTATE, ALLOWING
OLDER MEN TO URINATE MORE FREELY. PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT DOES NOT NECESSARILY
INTERFERE WITH SEXUAL FUNCTION, BUT RELIEVING THE CONDITION CAN ONLY HELP MEN
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL EQUIPMENT, WHICH JUST MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP WITH
ERECTION.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. FOR ERECTION PROBLEMS, AROMATHERAPISTS OFTEN
RECOMMEND WHOLE-BODY MASSAGE WITH A COMBINATION OF A FEW DROPS OF THE ES192
FAINTIN G
SENTIAL OILS OF CLARY SAGE, JASMINE AND ROSE MIXED INTO A VEGETABLE OIL BASE.
(REMEMBER NOT TO INGEST THE OIL, HOWEVER, AS EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE
TOXIC.) PERSONALLY, PVE FOUND MASSAGE TO BE A WONDERFUL APHRODISIAC, EVEN
WITHOUT THE AROMATIC OILS.
FAINTIIIGF
H
ERBS FOR FAINTING? THE PICTURE THAT COMES TO MIND IS DEFINITELY TUMOF-THE-CENTURY—A SCENTED HANDKERCHIEF BEING WAVED UNDER THE NOSE
OF A FAINTING WOMAN. AND IT'S TRUE THAT WOMEN FAINTED A LOT IN THE DAYS OF QUEEN
VICTORIA'S REIGN. OFTEN IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WORE THEIR CORSETS TOO TIGHT.
FOLK MEDICINE DOES, IN FACT, OFFER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT "SMELLING SALTS,"
STRONG-SCENTED SUBSTANCES THAT CAN WAKE UP THE SLUMBERING AND JAR THEM BACK
TO FULL CONSCIOUSNESS.
FAINTING, OR SWOONING, IS SIMPLY SUDDEN LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS A RESULT

 OF DECREASED BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN. AMONG THE CAUSES ARE HUNGER, EXHAUSI TION, SEVERE EMOTIONAL UPSET AND PAIN. A HOT, STUFFY ENVIRONMENT CAN DO IT, TOO.
IF YOU FEEL FAINT, STANDARD FIRST-AID ADVICE IS TO LIE ON YOUR BACK AND ELEVATE YOUR LEGS TO COAX MORE BLOOD INTO YOUR BRAIN. OR SIT WITH YOUR HEAD LOW-
[
 ERED BETWEEN YOUR KNEES TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING.
'< A NUMBER OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE FAINTING, AND SOME OF THEM ARE
I FAIRLY SERIOUS. IF YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO FAINT EASILY, OR IF YOU FAINT FOR NO APPARENT REASON, A DOCTOR'S VISIT IS USUALLY IN ORDER.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR FAINTING
} HERBALISTS NO LONGER RECOMMEND ROUTINELY CARRYING SMELLING SALTS. BUT IF
, YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO FAINT, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF HERBS THAT ACT LIKE SMELLING
SALTS THAT YOU CAN HAVE ON HAND. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF STIMULANT HERBS
THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL IN PREVENTING FAINTING.
) W BROOMWEED (SIDA RHOMBIFOLIA). CANARY ISLANDERS BREW THE LEAVES
) OF THIS HERB INTO A TEA. FM NOT SURPRISED, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS EPHEDRINE, THE PO-
, TENT CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULANT AND DECONGESTANT. FD TRY A STRONG TEA MADE
WITH ABOUT FIVE TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP UNTIL COOL.
> W CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM). FOR CENTURIES, ARABS HAVE
) ADDED CARDAMOM TO THEIR COFFEE IN THE BELIEF THAT IT WAS AN APHRODISIAC. I CAN'T
) 193
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
SWEAR THAT IT STIMULATES THE LIBIDO, BUT IT CERTAINLY STIMULATES THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, CARDAMOM IS THE BEST SOURCE OF THE STIMULANT
COMPOUND CINEOLE, WHICH IS PRESENT IN MOST OF THE HERBS THAT AROMATHERAPISTS
RECOMMEND FOR FAINTING. FOR A LITTLE EXTRA KICK, I FREQUENDY ADD ONE OR TWO CARDAMOM SEEDS TO COFFEE OR TEA. IT TASTES REALLY GOOD.
VV COFFEE (COJFEA, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER CAFFEINE-CONTAINING
BEVERAGES. COFFEE CONTAINS THAT FAMOUS STIMULANT, CAFFEINE. IT'S AN OLD FAVORITE
FOR GETTING RID OF THAT FAINT FEELING. BUT OTHER CAFFEINE-CONTAINING BEVERAGES HAVE
ALSO BEEN USED TO TREAT FAINTING, INCLUDING TEA, COLAS AND THE SOUTH AMERICAN
DRINKS MATE, GUARANA AND CACAO. HOT CHOCOLATE WORKS, TOO, SINCE IT ALSO CONTAINS
CAFFEINE.
VV COUNTRY MALLOW (SIDA CARDIFOUA). HERE'S AN HERB THAT'S GENEROUSLY
ENDOWED WITH THE STIMULANT COMPOUND EPHEDRINE. THE SEEDS HAVE THE MOST. BECAUSE OF ITS STIMULANT ACTION, COUNTRY MALLOW HAS EVEN BEEN USED TO TREAT NARCOLEPSY, A CONDITION THAT GIVES PEOPLE THE OVERWHELMING URGE TO FALL ASLEEP.
TRY MAKING A STRONG TEA USING FIVE TEASPOONS OF THIS HERB PER CUP OF BOILING
WATER. STEEP UNTIL COOL.
^V EPHEDRA (EPHEDRA SINICA). ALSO KNOWN AS MA HUANG OR CHINESE
EPHEDRA, THIS HERB IS THE BEST SOURCE OF EPHEDRINE.
THE BIG PROBLEM WITH WHOLE EPHEDRA, AS WELL AS ITS CHEMICAL COMPONENTS
EPHEDRINE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE, IS ITS SIDE EFFECTS: INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, RESTLESSNESS AND POSSIBLY AGGRAVATION OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THIS HERB. IN FACT, IF YOU TAKE REALLY HIGH DOSES, VERY STRANGE THINGS CAN
HAPPEN. THE MEDICAL LITERATURE CONTAINS 20 CASE REPORTS OF EPHEDRINE PSYCHOSIS.
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS, SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF
ABUSING THIS HERB. THEY TOOK LARGE OVERDOSES OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING EPHEDRA IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET HIGH. UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THESE INCIDENTS, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS DECIDED IT'S TOO MUCH OF A
STIMULANT, AND THEY HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REMOVE EPHEDRINE SUPPLEMENTS FROM
THE MARKET.
WHEN I USE EPHEDRA, I BREW A TEA USING A HALF-TEASPOON OR SO OF DRIED HERB
(OR A HALF-TEASPOON TO ONE TEASPOON OF TINCTURE) PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. I STEEP
IT UNTIL IT'S COOL ENOUGH TO DRINK. THESE FORMS OF THE HERB ARE SAFE TO USE AT THE
RECOMMENDED DOSES.
W EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS). THIS HERB HAS A SHARP, PUNGENT
AROMA THAT IS FAMILIAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS EVER SNIFFED VICKS VAPO-RUB. IT COMES
ABOUT AS CLOSE AS WE GET IN MODEM TIMES TO SMELLING SALTS. AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST PLACING A DROP OR TWO OF EUCALYPTUS ESSENTIAL OIL ON A CLOTH AND HOLDING IT
UNDER THE NOSE TO REVIVE SOMEONE WHO HAS FAINTED. (EUCALYPTUS OIL SHOULD NEVER
BE INGESTED, HOWEVER.)
194
FEVER
EUCALYPTUS IS ALSO HIGH IN THE STIMULANT COMPOUND CINEOLE, SO AFTER THE
PERSON IS MORE OR LESS REVIVED, TRY GIVING SOME EUCALYPTUS TEA MADE WITH ONE TO
TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED LEAVES PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
W ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). THE OIL THAT GIVES ROSEMARY ITS
UNIQUE AROMA IS WELL-ENDOWED WITH CINEOLE, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ACTIVE
WHETHER IT'S INHALED, INGESTED OR APPLIED DIRECTLY TO THE SKIN.
USE ROSEMARY AS YOU WOULD EUCALYPTUS: IF SOMEONE FAINTS, PLACE A DROP OR
TWO OF ROSEMARY ESSENTIAL OIL ON A TISSUE AND HOLD IT UNDER THE PERSON'S NOSTRILS.
(AGAIN, THOUGH, THE OIL SHOULD NOT BE INGESTED.) OR CRUSH A HANDFUL OF ROSEMARY'S NEEDLELIKE LEAVES INTO A BALL AND HOLD THAT UNDER THE PERSON'S NOSE.
ONCE THE PERSON HAS REVIVED, BREW UP SOME ROSEMARY TEA USING ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED LEAVES PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
OTHER HERBS WITH GOOD AMOUNTS OF CINEOLE INCLUDE SWEET ANNIE AND GINGER.
YOU CAN USE THEM THE SAME WAY.
V LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). MY GOOD FRIEND, RESPECTED
CALIFORNIA HERBALIST KATHI KEVILLE, WHO WROTE THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA
AND HERBS FOR HEALTH AND HEALING, NOTES THAT THE VICTORIANS WERE CLEARLY PREPARED
FOR SWOONING. THE LADIES CARRIED LITTLE AROMATHERAPEUTIC "SWOONING PILLOWS" FILLED
WITH STIMULATING LAVENDER AND CAMPHOR. SHE OFFERS A GOOD RECIPE FOR SMELLING SALTS:
FILL A SMALL VIAL WITH TABLE SALT AND ADD A DOZEN DROPS OF LAVENDER, ROSEMARY OR
EUCALYPTUS OIL.
V SOURSOP (ANNONA MURICATA). THE LEAVES OF THIS TROPICAL MEMBER OF
THE PAWPAW FAMILY CONTAIN AROMATIC COMPOUNDS. IN THE CARIBBEAN, PEOPLE CRUSH
THE LEAVES AND USE THEM AS SMELLING SALTS WHEN SOMEONE FEELS FAINT. IN A PINCH,
I'D TRY SEEDS FROM ANY OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN PAWPAWS, BUT DON'T GET THE JUICES IN
YOUR EYES—THEY MAY CAUSE EYE PROBLEMS.
FEVER
T
HE WORST FEVER I EVER HAD LAID ME LOW IN DARIEN, PANAMA, IN 1961.1 WAS
PART OF A TEAM THAT INCLUDED A GEOGRAPHER, A HYDROLOGIST AND A WORLDRENOWNED TROPICAL ECOLOGIST, LES HOLDRIDGE, PH.D.
IN BETWEEN FORAYS INTO THE BUSH TO STUDY THE VEGETATION IN THAT WILD, FRONTIER AREA, WE STAYED IN A MODEST YELLOW HOUSE RENTED FROM A GERMAN OIL MAN.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SOMETIMES THERE WAS PURE RAINWATER TO DRINK, AND RARELY, WHEN THE TOWN
GENERATOR RAN IN EL REAL, WE HAD ELECTRICITY. RETURNING TO THE HOUSE ONE DAY, I
SUDDENLY DEVELOPED ALTERNATING CHILLS AND FEVER. MY BUDDIES TOLD ME I WAS
DELIRIOUS FOR HOURS.
IN MY LUCID MOMENTS, I ASSUMED THAT I HAD MALARIA, SINCE ALTERNATING FEVER
AND CHILLS ARE A HALLMARK OF THAT TROPICAL SCOURGE. BUT THERE WAS NO DOCTOR
AROUND, SO I COULDN'T BE SURE. I TOOK SOME ANTIMALARIA MEDICATION, FIGURING THAT
THE PILLS THAT SUPPRESS THE MALARIA BUG MIGHT ALSO GET RID OF ALL SORTS OF OTHER MICROORGANISMS, ANY NUMBER OF WHICH MIGHT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO MY BODY.
WHATEVER WAS CAUSING MY FEVER, THE ANTIMALARIA PILLS KNOCKED IT OUT BEFORE IT
KNOCKED ME OFF.
NOW IT'S 35 YEARS LATER, AND I'VE JUST RETIRED FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
AGRICULTURE AND THE JOB THAT TOOK ME TO SO MANY EXOTIC LOCALES. BUT MY BELOVED
DATABASE WILL REMAIN ON THE INTERNET, ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED.
THERE YOU CAN FIND HUNDREDS OF PLANTS THAT ARE SAID TO REDUCE FEVER. BUT TO SAVE
YOU A HUNT IN THE WILD FRONTIER OF THE INTERNET (WHICH COULD GIVE YOU A FEVER), I'LL
REVIEW THE HIGHLIGHTS HERE.
COOLING THE FEVERED, BROW
AROUND THE WORLD, AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF PLANTS HAVE BEEN USED TO
TREAT FEVER. IN INDONESIA ALONE, 256 PLANTS ARE FOLKLORIC FEVER FIGHTERS. MANY OF
THEM I'VE NEVER SEEN, AND I'VE SPENT A LIFETIME IN THIS FIELD.
IN MY EXPERIENCE, MORE THAN HALF OF FOLKLORIC MEDICINAL PLANTS LIVE UP TO
THEIR REPUTATIONS. BUT I SUSPECT THAT FOR FEVER, THE FIGURE IS HIGHER. IT'S FAIRLY EASY
TO TELL IF AN HERB ACTUALLY REDUCES FEVER, SO THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK WOULD RARELY
IF EVER HAVE DEVELOPED A REPUTATION FOR EFFICACY.
IF I DEVELOPED A SERIOUS FEVER IN ANY OTHER OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE AND HAD NO
ACCESS TO A PHYSICIAN, YOU CAN BET I'D CONSULT THE LOCALS, IN SIGN LANGUAGE, AND
LET THEM FEEL THE HEAT ON MY FOREHEAD. AND I'M SURE I COULD FIND SOMEONE WHO
COULD LEAD ME TO FEVER-COOLING PLANT MEDICINE, PROBABLY GROWING CLOSE AT HAND.
BITTER BOUNTY
THE WORLD'S BEST-KNOWN FEVER MEDICINE IS ASPIRIN, DERIVED FROM THE SALICYLATES IN WILLOW BARK AND MANY OTHER PLANTS. I'VE SEEN WILLOW GROWING ALMOST
EVERYWHERE, ALL THE WAY FROM MAINE, WHERE I GIVE MY SUMMER ETHNOBOTANY
CLASS, TO THE AMAZON, WHERE I HOLD MY WINTER CLASSES. WILLOW TREES GROW FROM
THE ARCTIC TO THE TROPICS AND WERE USED BY THOUSANDS OF ETHNIC GROUPS LONG BE196
FEVER
FORE BAYER DECIDED TO TURN NATURE'S ASPIRIN INTO A PHARMACEUTICAL PILL.
WHILE SALICYLATES ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO ME AS A BOTANIST, I MUST ADMIT THAT
THEY ARE ALSO UNFATHOMABLE. SALICYLIC ACID LOWERS MY TEMPERATURE, BUT THE VERY
SAME CHEMICAL CAUSES PLANTS TO WARM UP BY AS MUCH AS 20 DEGREES ABOVE THE
TEMPERATURE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS. SALICYLATES ARE THE REASON THAT SNOW MELTS
AROUND SKUNK CABBAGE IN FEBRUARY. DON'T ASK ME TO EXPLAIN IT; I'M JUST TELLING
IT LIKE IT IS.
SALICYLATES HAVE A BITTER TASTE, AS DO THE VAST MAJORITY OF FEVER-REDUCING
PLANT CHEMICALS. IT SEEMS TO GO WITH THE HEALING TERRITORY. MY DATABASE CONTAINS A LIST OF 25 PLANTS USED IN OAXACA, MEXICO, TO TREAT MALARIA, AND ALL BUT
ONE IS BITTER. SO IF YOU'RE TREATING FEVER WITH HERBS, YOU'LL HAVE TO BRACE YOURSELF FOR A BITTER NATURAL PILL.
WHILE PEOPLE RIGHTLY REGARD FEVER AS A SIGN OF INFECTION, ATTEMPTING TO BRING
IT DOWN IS SOMETIMES A MISTAKE. UP TO A POINT, FEVER IS A FRIEND. MOST MICROORGANISMS THAT CAUSE DISEASE DIE WHEN EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES, SO FEVER IS
ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TRIES TO KILL THEM. THE TROUBLE IS
THAT PROLONGED HIGH FEVERS CAN KILL US, TOO.
A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS: DON'T TREAT EVERY FEVER RIGHT AWAY. TREAT IT WHEN IT
STARTS MAKING YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. FOR HIGH FEVER—ABOVE 103°—YOU'LL
WANT TO CONSULT A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, OF COURSE. FOR MILDER HIGH TEMPERATURE—99° TO 101°—YOU MAY CHOOSE TO TAKE ASPIRIN, ACETAMINOPHEN OR
IBUPROFEN (MOTRIN OR ADVIL). ONE WORD OF CAUTION: MOST BENIGN FEVERS START TO
LET UP WITHIN A DAY OR TWO. IF ANY FEVER, EVEN A MILD ONE, PERSISTS FOR MORE THAN
48 HOURS, SEE YOUR DOCTOR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR FEVER
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE A FEVER. AS A GENERAL
RULE, HOWEVER, REMEMBER THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO GIVE ASPIRIN OR ASPIRIN-LIKE
HERBS TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE FEVERS WITH VIRAL INFECTIONS SUCH AS COLDS, FLU AND
CHICKEN POX. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY COULD DEVELOP REYE'S SYNDROME, A
POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION THAT CAUSES LIVER AND BRAIN DAMAGE. AND IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS.
^¾¾. WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WHEN THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH
MINISTER EDWARD STONE SET OUT TO FIND A CHEAP SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPENSIVE IMPORTED
CINCHONA BARK, WHICH WAS USED TO TREAT MALARIA AND OTHER FEVERS, HE NOTICED THAT
WILLOW BARK TASTED JUST AS BITTER AND DECIDED TO TRY IT.
WILLOW PROVED TO BE A GOOD PAIN RELIEVER AND FEVER FIGHTER, AND ITS USE
SPREAD AROUND ENGLAND, EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS. THE ACTIVE COMPOUND
SALICIN WAS ISOLATED IN 1830, AND THE BAYER COMPANY TINKERED WITH SALICIN TO
197
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CREATE ASPIRIN. THE NEW BAYER ASPIRIN WAS RELEASED IN THE 1890S, AND IT
QUICKLY BECAME ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR DRUGS. BUT YOU CAN STILL USE
WILLOW BARK. I DO.
TRY MAKING A TEA WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED BARK STEEPED IN A CUP
OF BOILING WATER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. YOU CAN MASK THE BITTER TASTE WITH CINNAMON, GINGER, CAMOMILE OR OTHER FLAVORFUL HERBS.
VV MEADOWSWEET (FILIPENDULA ULMARIA). THIS IS ANOTHER EXCELLENT
SOURCE OF SALICIN, THE CHEMICAL IN WILLOW BARK THAT FIGHTS FEVER. COMMISSION E, THE
BODY OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, SUGGESTS
MAKING A TEA WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF MEADOWSWEET FLOWERS. TRY UP TO THREE
CUPS A DAY.
V ELDER (SAMBUCUS NIGRA). COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING TWO TO THREE
TEASPOONS OF ELDER FLOWERS A DAY IN TEA FOR FEVERISH CHILLS.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). IN STUDIES WITH ANIMALS, SEVERAL
COMPOUNDS IN GINGER HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ANTI-FEVER VALUE, ACCORDING TO VARRO
TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT
PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA. NEITHER HE NOR I KNOW
OF ANY HUMAN STUDIES OF GINGER FOR FEVER, BUT IT'S A SAFE HERB, SO IT PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HURT IF YOU WANT TO BREW GINGER TEA, EAT CANDIED GINGER OR SIP GINGER ALE.
ALSO, GINGER'S FLAVOR CAN HELP MAKE OTHER FEVER-REDUCING HERB TEAS MORE PALATABLE.
AND IT JUST MIGHT HELP FIGHT FEVER.
V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). MANY HERBALISTS RECOMMEND
PEPPERMINT FOR RELIEVING FEVER, SUGGESTING SUCH COMBINATIONS AS ELDER
AND PEPPERMINT OR WILLOW AND PEPPERMINT. IF I HAD A FEVER, I WOULD ADD PEPPERMINT TO FEVER-FIGHTING TEAS. IT WOULD CERTAINLY ENHANCE THE FLAVOR.
V RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES), CINNAMON (CMNAMVMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND CRANBERRY (VACCINIUM MACROCARPON).
IN MY DATABASE, RED PEPPER IS A FAIR SOURCE OF SALICYLATES. CINNAMON AND CRANBERRY ALSO HAVE ANTI-FEVER REPUTATIONS. THE NEXT TIME I HAVE A FEVER, I THINK I'LL TRY
CRANBERRY SAUCE TOPPED WITH CAYENNE AND CINNAMON.
FLATULENCE
R
ECENTLY, MY WIFE AND I TRIED FAVA BEANS, ALSO KNOWN AS FABA BEANS.
THESE ARE SIMILAR TO, ALTHOUGH BULKIER THAN, BIG LIMA BEANS. WE EX198
FLATULENCE
PECTED THAT LIKE ALL OTHER BEANS, THEY WOULD GENERATE A LOT OF GAS. IMAGINE OUR
SURPRISE WHEN GAS WAS NOT A PROBLEM.
PERHAPS THE REASON WAS THAT I HAD RESORTED TO FOLKLORE IN AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE BEAN-INDUCED FLATULENCE. I SOAKED DRY BEANS IN WATER OVERNIGHT, THEN DISCARDED THE WATER AND COOKED THE SOAKED BEANS IN NEW WATER. IT'S AN AGE-OLD
ANTI-GAS STRATEGY.
IN ADDITION, I USED AN OLD CHINESE APPROACH THAT I GOT FROM CHINESE
HEALING FOODS AND HERBS, A BOOK BY PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. THE CHINESE SOAK THEIR BEANS IN WATER TO WHICH
THEY ADD THE ANNUAL WORMWOOD (ARTEMISIA ANNUA).
FINALLY, FOR ADDED PROTECTION, I ALSO FOLLOWED AN APPALACHIAN ANTI-FLATULENCE SUGGESTION AND COOKED MY BEANS WITH A SMALL, WHOLE CARROT.
IF I'D HAD ANY WORMSEED, OR EPAZOTE (CHENOPODIUM AMBROSIOIDES), I WOULD HAVE ADDED A DASH OF THAT AS WELL. MEXICANS COOK THEIR BEANS WITH THIS HERB TO
REDUCE FLATUS.
WHAT WITH OVERNIGHT SOAKING, WORMWOOD AND A CARROT TO HELP US, PEGGY
AND I EXPERIENCED NO SIGNIFICANT FLATULENCE FROM OUR FAVA BEANS.
BACTERIA AT WORK
MOST FLATUS IS PRODUCED IN THE INTESTINE BY UNDIGESTED CARBOHYDRATES. INSTEAD OF BEING BROKEN DOWN IN THE STOMACH, SOME STARCHES ENTER THE SMALL INTESTINE INTACT. THE INTESTINE DOES NOT PRODUCE THE ENZYMES NECESSARY TO DIGEST
TWO SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATES, RAFFINOSE AND STACHYOSE, SO THEY JUST SIT THERE UNTIL
THE BACTERIA THAT NORMALLY INHABIT THE BOWEL FERMENT THEM, A PROCESS THAT RELEASES GAS.
GUESS WHICH FOODS ARE HIGHEST IN RAFFINOSE AND STACHYOSE? YOU GUESSED
IT—BEANS. AND AMONG BEANS, THE THREE THAT ARE HIGHEST IN THAT PAIR OF CARBOHYDRATES ARE ENGLISH PEAS, SOYBEANS AND BLACK-EYED PEAS. BUT THOSE AREN'T THE
ONLY ONES: LIMAS, PINTOS, BLACK BEANS AND OTHER LEGUMES ALSO CONTAIN ENOUGH
OF THESE INDIGESTIBLE CARBOHYDRATES TO PRODUCE GAS.
IF YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE PRODUCING MORE GAS THAN YOU USED TO, YOU MAY BE
RIGHT. IF YOU'VE EVOLVED YOUR DIET IN A HEALTHIER DIRECTION RECENTLY AND ARE
EATING LESS MEAT, FEWER FATS AND MORE CARBOHYDRATES (ESPECIALLY BEANS), THE
CHANCES ARE THAT YOU'VE BEEN EATING MORE OF THE FOODS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO
PRODUCE GAS.
MOST PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN OF "EXCESS GAS," ON THE OTHER HAND, ACTUALLY
PRODUCE AMOUNTS THAT DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SPECIALISTS (GASTROENTEROLOGISTS) WOULD
CALL PERFECTLY NORMAL. STUDIES SHOW THAT THE AVERAGE ADULT PASSES GAS FROM 8 TO
) 199
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
20 TIMES EVERY WAKING HOUR OF THE DAY. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL
ABOUT RELEASING GAS MORE THAN ONCE AN HOUR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR FLATULENCE
JUST BECAUSE FLATULENCE IS NORMAL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S WELCOME. FLATUS CANNOT
BE BANISHED FROM THE BODY, BUT YOU CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF
UNWANTED EXCLAMATIONS. A NUMBER OF HERBS CAN HELP.
W * ASSORTED CARMINATIVE HERBS. ANY HERB THAT SOOTHES THE DIGESTIVE TRACT
AND HAS A REPUTATION FOR MINIMIZING FLATUS IS KNOWN AS A CARMINATIVE.
DOZENS OF HERBS FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY, SO IT'S HARD TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW.
THE MOST HELPFUL ARE THOSE CONTAINING THE MOST GAS-RELIEVING CHEMICALS, MOST
NOTABLY THE COMPOUNDS CAMPHOR, CARVONE, EUGENOL, MENTHOL AND THYMOL. THESE
COMPOUNDS ARE ESPECIALLY CONCENTRATED IN ALLSPICE, CLOVES, CORNMINT, CARAWAY,
DILL, FENNEL, HORSEBALM, PEPPERMINT, SAGE AND THYME.
IN ADDITION, MOST OF THE HERBS IN THE MINT AND CARROT FAMILIES ARE GOOD
R 1
BANISHING GAS
BESIDES TAKING HERBS, YOU CAN TRY A NUMBER OF OTHER NATURAL APPROACHES TO HELP SHUT
OFF YOUR BODY'S GASWORKS.
ONE WAY IS TO STOP EATING BEANS, BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT. BEANS ARE
INEXPENSIVE SOURCES OF HIGH-QUALITY PROTEIN, FIBER AND OTHER NUTRIENTS.
OR YOU COULD TRY BEANO. THIS PRODUCT, AVAILABLE AT PHARMACIES, HEALTH FOOD
STORES AND SOME SUPERMARKETS, CONTAINS THE ENZYMES THAT CAN DIGEST THE GASCAUSING CARBOHYDRATES RAFFINOSE AND STACHYOSE BUT WHICH OUR BODIES DON'T PRODUCE. A STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT IT WORKS.
IT ALSO HELPS TO EAT MORE SLOWLY. CHEW YOUR FOOD THOROUGHLY. MAKE MEALS AS
RELAXED AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU EAT QUICKLY AND WOLF YOUR FOOD DOWN, YOU SWALLOW
LARGER LUMPS, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENTER THE INTESTINE UNDIGESTED.
LACTOSE INTOLERANCE IS ANOTHER MAJOR CAUSE OF FLATULENCE. TRY CUTTING DOWN
ON OR ELIMINATING DAIRY PRODUCTS FOR A WEEK OR TWO AND SEE IF YOU EXPERIENCE LESS
GAS AND STOMACH DISTRESS. IF YOU DO, YOU'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MANY PEOPLE WHO
HAVE TROUBLE DIGESTING MILK SUGAR (LACTOSE). TO DEAL WITH THIS, YOU HAVE TWO
CHOICES: EITHER CUT WAY BACK ON DAIRY FOODS (ALTHOUGH YOGURT IS USUALLY OKAY) OR
TRY ADDING THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT LACTAID TO MILK. LACTAID CONTAINS THE ENZYME
THAT DIGESTS LACTOSE.
SOME PEOPLE NOTICE AN INCREASE IN FLATULENCE WHEN THEY EAT FOODS THAT ARE ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED WITH SORBITOL. READ FOOD LABELS CAREFULLY AND TRY AVOIDING SORBITOL FOR A TIME. IF YOU NOTICE THAT YOU'RE PASSING LESS GAS, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
PERMANENTLY AVOID THIS SWEETENER.

FUNGAL INFECTIONS
CARMINATIVES, INCLUDING ANISEED, BASIL, BERGAMOT, CAMOMILE, CINNAMON, CORIANDER, GARLIC, GINGER, HYSSOP, JUNIPER, LAVENDER, LEMON, MARJORAM, NUTMEG,
ONION, OREGANO, ROSEMARY, SAVORY AND TARRAGON.TRY USING CARMINATIVE HERBS TO
FLAVOR STARCHY DISHES, ESPECIALLY THOSE MADE WITH BEANS.
YOU CAN ALSO DEFLATE FLATUS WITH MY CARMINATEA, MADE WITH CAMOMILE, CARAWAY, DILL, FENNEL, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA) AND PEPPERMINT AND
SWEETENED WITH LICORICE.
FUNGAL INJECTIONS
A
THLETE'S FOOT. VAGINAL YEAST INFECTIONS. JOCK ITCH. FUNGAL TOENAIL INFECTIONS. THERE IS PLENTY OF FUNGUS AMONG US. I'VE CERTAINLY HAD MY OWN
SHARE OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS.
WHILE THERE ARE SEPARATE CHAPTERS IN THIS BOOK FOR ATHLETE'S FOOT AND YEAST
INFECTIONS, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO INCLUDE THIS MORE GENERIC LOOK AT
HERBS THAT CAN BE USED TO TREAT ANY FUNGAL INFECTION. WHENEVER I GET FUNGAL INFECTIONS AT MY HERBAL VINEYARD IN MARYLAND, I OFTEN TRY MIXTURES OF GARLIC AND
BLACK WALNUT, BOTH OF WHICH GROW IN PROFUSION ON MY LAND, ALONG WITH TEATREE
OIL, WHICH I KEEP ON HAND. EACH OF THESE HERBS IS POTENDY ANTIFUNGAL.
SO WHY, YOU MIGHT ASK, DO I GO TO THE TROUBLE OF MIXING THEM? WHY NOT JUST
FIND A GOOD ONE AND STICK TO IT, IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL TRADITION OF ISOLATING THE
MAGIC BULLET? ONE REASON IS THAT I LOVE TO WORK WITH HERBS AND HAVE FUN MIXING
THEM. ANOTHER IS THAT THE RESEARCH IS QUITE CLEAR: MIXTURES OF ANTIFUNGAL HERBS
ALMOST ALWAYS WORK BETTER THAN SINGLE HERBS.
THE SYNERGY—THE HARMONIOUS WORKING TOGETHER—OF ANTIFUNGAL HERBS HAS
BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL STUDIES. IN ONE TEST OF TEN PLANT SPECIES WHOSE
OILS WERE ANTIFUNGAL, RESEARCHERS NOTED THAT "COMBINATIONS OF THE ANTIFUNGAL
ESSENTIAL OILS INCREASED THEIR ACTIVITY REMARKABLY." IN A SIMILAR STUDY, RESEARCHERS NOTED THAT "IN ALL THE OIL COMBINATIONS, THE ANTIFUNGAL POTENCY WAS
FOUND TO INCREASE OVER INDIVIDUAL OILS."
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED BY THIS. AFTER ALL, ESSENTIAL OILS ARE COMPLEX
COMBINATIONS OF COMPOUNDS THAT EVOLVED TO PROTECT PLANTS AGAINST FUNGI AND
OTHER DISEASES AND PESTS. SYNERGY IS THE RULE IN NATURE, SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT
COMBINATIONS WOULD WORK BETTER THAN A SINGLE, ISOLATED ESSENTIAL OIL CONSTITUENT.
CURRENTLY, MANY PHARMACEUTICAL "MAGIC BULLET" ANTIFUNGALS ARE MORE PO201
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TENT THAN HERBAL APPROACHES, AND SOMETIMES WHEN I HAVE A BAD FUNGAL INFECTION, I USE THEM. BUT EVEN THEN, I OFTEN COMBINE THEM WITH HERBS FOR AN EXTRA
ANTIFUNGAL BOOST. IF YOUR DOCTOR CONCURS, TRY THIS THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A FUNGAL
INFECTION AND SEE HOW SYNERGY WORKS FOR YOU.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR FUNGAL INFECTIONS
HERE ARE SOME ANTIFUNGAL HERBS THAT CAN GET THE JOB DONE.
W * GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). I BELIEVE THAT GARLIC IS AMONG OUR BEST ANTISEPTICS IN GENERAL AND ANTIFUNGALS IN PARTICULAR, CLOSELY RIVALING TEATREE OIL.
AT THE BANARAS HINDU UNIVERSITY IN INDIA, SCIENTISTS WORKING WITH GARLIC
COMPOUNDS SHOWED THAT ONE OF ITS CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS, AJOENE, WAS ALMOST AS
EFFECTIVE AGAINST MILDEW FUNGUS AS SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIFUNGALS. SEVERAL
OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN SIMILAR RESULTS.
CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE ALSO YIELDED IMPRESSIVE RESULTS. AMONG PEOPLE TAKING
25 MILLILITERS (FIVE TO SIX TEASPOONS) OF GARLIC EXTRACT A DAY, THEIR BLOOD SERUM EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY AGAINST SEVERAL COMMON FUNGI, INCLUDING
CANDIDA ALBICANS, WHICH CAUSES YEAST INFECTIONS.
GARLIC EXTRACT IS EVEN MORE POTENT WHEN APPLIED EXTERNALLY. I KNOW FROM
BOTH RESEARCH AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT IT BOOSTS THE ANTIFUNGAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS. SIMPLY LIQUEFY RAW GARLIC IN A BLENDER
AND USE A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH TO APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA THREE
TIMES A DAY.
V W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA), ACORDING TO MY DATABASE, LICORICE
CONTAINS AT LEAST 25 FUNGICIDAL COMPOUNDS, MORE THAN ANY OTHER HERB LISTED.
ODDLY, I HAVEN'T FOUND ANY GOOD CLINICAL TRIALS ON USING LICORICE EXTRACTS TO TREAT
FUNGAL INFECTIONS, BUT BASED ON THIS HERB'S ANTIFUNGAL CONTENT, FM CONFIDENT THAT IT
WOULD HELP.
YOU CAN MAKE A STRONG DECOCTION BY ADDING FIVE TO SEVEN TEASPOONS OF
POWDERED LICORICE ROOT TO A CUP OF BOILING WATER AND SIMMERING FOR ABOUT 20
MINUTES. STRAIN OUT THE PLANT MATERIAL. USING A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH, APPLY
THE LIQUID TO THE AFFECTED AREA ONE TO THREE TIMES A DAY.
V^^, TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). TEATREE OIL IS A POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC THAT IS VERY USEFUL AGAINST FUNGAL SKIN INFECTIONS, INCLUDING ATHLETE'S FOOT
AND YEAST INFECTIONS. AUSTRALIAN CHEMISTS HAVE DETERMINED THAT C. ALBICANS IS REMARKABLY SENSITIVE TO TEATREE OIL. THIS RESEARCH LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS TO TREAT VAGINITIS CAUSED BY YEAST. SEVERAL WOMEN I KNOW HAVE REPORTED
SUCCESS USING TEATREE OIL FOR VAGINAL INFECTIONS THAT COULD NOT BE ENTIRELY ERADICATED BY PHARMACEUTICALS LIKE NYSTATIN AND CLOTRIMAZOLE.
FOR SKIN INFECTIONS, YOU CAN APPLY A FEW DROPS OF OIL DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED
202
FUNGAL INFECTIONS
AREA THREE TIMES A DAY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO DILUTE IT WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF VEGETABLE OIL, AS SOME PEOPLE FIND IT IRRITATING TO THE SKIN. FOR VAGINAL INFECTIONS,
YOU CAN APPLY SOME DILUTED OIL DIRECTLY OR MIX A FEW DROPS OF OIL INTO A LUKEWARM DOUCHE OR SITZ BATH. IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY DISCOMFORT, DISCONTINUE USE.
THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU USE IT ON OR AROUND THE VAGINA, AS THIS IS A
PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE AREA. IN FACT, TEATREE OIL IS SUCH A POTENT ANTISEPTIC THAT I
WOULD RECOMMEND USING IT ON THE VAGINAL AREA ONLY AS A LAST RESORT, AND ALWAYS
IN A DILUTED FORM. TRY OTHER, GENTLER HERBAL APPROACHES FIRST. THEN, IF YOU WANT
TO USE THIS OIL, DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. AND ONE FINAL WARNING: DON'T INGEST
THE OIL. LIKE SO MANY OTHER ESSENTIAL PLANT OILS, SMALL AMOUNTS OF TEATREE OIL,
ON THE ORDER OF A FEW TEASPOONS, CAN BE FATAL.
W BLACK WALNUT (JUGLANS NIGRA). KATHI KEVILLE, AUTHOR OF THE ILLUSTRATED
HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR HEALTH AND HEALING, A CALIFORNIA HERBALIST WHOI ADMIRE, RECOUNTS ONE IMPRESSIVE STUDY SHOWING THAT THE FRESH HUSK OF THE BLACK
WALNUT DESTROYED CANDIDA BETTER THAN A COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ANTIFUNGAL DRUG.
HER CANDIDA TINCTURE CONTAINS ONE OUNCE OF TINCTURE OF FRESH BLACK WALNUT HUSK
PLUS A FEW DROPS EACH OF TINCTURES OF LAVENDER FLOWERS, VALERIAN ROOT AND PAU
D'ARCO, WITH TEN ADDED DROPS OF TEATREE OIL. I'M PARTIAL TO KEVILLE'S EMPHASIS ON
BLACK WALNUTS BECAUSE AT MY PLACE EACH AUTUMN, THESE NUTS ARE AS COMMON AS
GOLF BALLS AT THE DRIVING RANGE ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
VV CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE IS A FUNGICIDAL THAT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD AGAINST CANDIDA. IT'S ALSO POTENDY ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY. CAMOMILE IS WIDELY USED IN EUROPE, WHERE IT'S INCORPORATED INTO MANY
OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTISEPTICS.
I SUGGEST USING CAMOMILE BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY FOR FUNGAL INFECTIONS. YOU CAN MAKE A STRONG TEA USING THE DRIED HERB AND DRINK IT SEVERAL
TIMES A DAY. YOU CAN ALSO APPLY THE TEA TWO TO FOUR TIMES A DAY DIRECTLY TO THE
AFFECTED AREA WITH A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH. OR SIMPLY USE THE SPENT TEA
BAGS. YOU MIGHT ALSO APPLY A TINCTURE PURCHASED AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB
SHOP.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION. IF
IT SEEMS TO HELP, GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE
ITCHING OR IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.
VV GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING
BERBERINE. BERBERINE IS A POWERFUL ANTIFUNGAL AND ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUND THAT'S
FOUND IN BARBERRY, GOLDTHREAD, OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT AS WELL AS GOLDENSEAL.
ALL HAVE BEEN USED TRADITIONALLY TO TREAT YEAST AND OTHER FUNGAL INFECTIONS.
203
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IF I HAD A FUNGAL INFECTION, I MIGHT BUY SOME GOLDENSEAL TINCTURE AND, FOLLOWING THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS,
ADD IT TO JUICE THREE TIMES A DAY. FOR SKIN APPLICATION I
WOULD MAKE A STRONG DECOCTION USING FIVE TO SEVEN TEASPOONS OF DRIED GOLDENSEAL TO A CUP OF WATER. BRING IT
TO A BOIL, THEN LET IT SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES. AFTER IT
COOLS, STRAIN OUT THE PLANT MATERIAL. I'D APPLY IT TO THE
AFFECTED AREA ONE TO THREE TIMES A DAY WITH A COTTON
BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
VV HENNA (LAWSONIA INERMIS). THIS POPULAR
NATURAL HAIR DYE CONTAINS 5,500 TO 10,000 PARTS PER MILLION OF THE COMPOUND LAWSONE, WHICH IS ACTIVE AGAINST
MANY FUNGI AND BACTERIA. I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING A
STRONG DECOCTION BY SIMMERING FIVE TO SEVEN TEASPOONS OF
HENNA PER CUP OF WATER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. ALLOW IT TO
COOL AND APPLY THE LIQUID TO THE AFFECTED AREA ONE TO THREE
TIMES A DAY WITH A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
VV LEMONGRASS (CYMBOPOGON, VARIOUS
SPECIES). SCIENTISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT LEMONGRASS
HAS SIGNIFICANT FUNGICIDAL ACTIVITY AGAINST SEVERAL
COMMON INFECTION-CAUSING FUNGI. YOU CAN ENJOY ONE TO
FOUR CUPS OF LEMONGRASS TEA A DAY. AND FOR ADDITIONAL ANTIFUNGAL BENEFIT, APPLY THE SPENT TEA BAGS DIRECDY TO THE
AFFECTED AREA.
^ V PAU-D'ARCO (TABEBUIA^ VARIOUS SPECIES).
THIS HERB CONTAINS THREE ANTI-YEAST COMPOUNDS—LAPACHOL, BETA-LAPACHONE AND
XYLOIDINE—THAT SHOW ACTIVITY AGAINST C. ALBICANS AND OTHER COMMON PROBLEM
FUNGI. I HAVE PERSONALLY USED A LATIN AMERICAN SALVE CONTAINING PAU-D'ARCO EXTRACT TO CLEAR UP A YEAST INFECTION AND WOULD DO SO AGAIN IF I HAD ANOTHER FLARE-UP.
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, HOWEVER, I'D GO WITH A STANDARDIZED COMMERCIAL PREPARATION AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). PAKISTANI STUDIES SHOW THAT OIL OF
TURMERIC, EVEN AT VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS, INHIBITS MANY COMMON PROBLEM FUNGI.
I'D SUGGEST USING COMMERCIAL OIL OF TURMERIC, DILUTING IT WITH WATER (ONE PART OIL TO
TWO PARTS WATER) AND APPLYING IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA WITH A COTTON BALL OR
CLEAN CLOTH.
GOLDENSEAL
ALSO KNOWN AS GOLDEN
ROOT, GOLDENSEAL IS A
WIDELY USED AND RECOM

GALLSTONES
AND KIDNEY STONES
MY DAD HAD KIDNEY STONES, BUT I'VE NEVER HAD ANY. THAT SURPRISES ME,
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO RUN IN FAMILIES.
I'M VERY GLAD THAT I'VE AVOIDED KIDNEY STONES SO FAR. THEY SAY THAT PASSING
A KIDNEY STONE, ALSO KNOWN AS BLADDER STONES AND GRAVEL, IS THE CLOSEST MEN
EVER COME TO EXPERIENCING THE PAIN OF CHILDBIRTH.
THE FACT THAT I'VE ALSO NEVER HAD GALLSTONES IS ALSO GOOD LUCK, ESPECIALLY
SINCE I'M AT RISK IN THIS AREA, TOO. A KEY RISK FACTOR IS BEING OVERWEIGHT, AND I
CONFESS TO BEING A TAD ON THE HEAVY SIDE.
SO WHAT HAS PROTECTED ME SO FAR? WELL, I LIKE TO THINK THAT MY NEAR-VEGETARIAN DIET, HEAVY ON HERBS AND LIQUIDS, HAS HELPED SAVE ME FROM BOTH TYPES.
PAINFUL PASSAGE FOR (MOSTLY) MEN
KIDNEY STONES FORM WHEN CERTAIN SUBSTANCES, CALCIUM OXALATE, CALCIUM
PHOSPHATE, MAGNESIUM AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE, URIC ACID OR CYSTINE—BECOME SO
CONCENTRATED IN THE URINE THAT THEY PRECIPITATE OUT AS HARD, SOLID LUMPS. THE MAIN
SYMPTOM OF KIDNEY STONES IS PAIN IN THE LEFT OR RIGHT LOWER BACK OR PELVIC AREA
THAT BECOMES EXCRUCIATING AS THE STONE ATTEMPTS TO LEAVE THE KIDNEY THROUGH
NARROW TUBES CALLED URETERS. OTHER SYMPTOMS ARE BLOOD IN THE URINE AND A PERSISTENT URGE TO URINATE.
KIDNEY STONES AFFECT MOSTLY MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER MEN. YOU INCREASE YOUR
RISKS IF YOUR DIET IS LOW IN PHOSPHATES OR PROTEIN OR YOU EAT A LOT OF FOOD THAT'S HIGH
IN SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS OXALATES. AMONG THE FOODS THAT HAVE OXALATES ARE COFFEE,
BLACK TEA, RHUBARB, SORREL, SPINACH, LAMB'S-QUARTERS AND PURSLANE. HERBAL FORMULAS WITH RHUBARB OR SHEEP SORREL MAY CONTAIN MORE OXALATES THAN WOULD BE
BENEFICIAL.
PHYSICIANS USUALLY DON'T TREAT KIDNEY STONES—THEY JUST MEDICATE THE PAIN
UNTIL THE STONES PASS ON THEIR OWN. UNTIL RECENTLY, IF A STONE DID NOT PASS, SURGERY
WAS NECESSARY. NOW A NONINVASIVE PROCEDURE CALLED LITHOTRIPSY USUALLY BREAKS
UP THE STONES SO THAT THEY CAN PASS. DURING LITHOTRIPSY, WHICH IS DONE UNDER ANESTHESIA, SHOCK WAVES ARE DIRECTED AT THE STONE TO PULVERIZE IT.
205
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
BACK PAIN IN (MOSTLY) WOMEN
GALLSTONES FORM WHEN CHOLESTEROL AND BILE PIGMENTS BECOME SO CONCENTRATED
THAT THEY FORM LUMPS INSIDE THE GALLBLADDER. THESE LUMPS MAY BE AS SMALL AS A
PINHEAD OR AS LARGE AS A GOLF BALL. GALLSTONES THAT REMAIN IN THE GALLBLADDER RARELY
CAUSE SYMPTOMS. BUT YOU CAN EXPECT MAJOR PROBLEMS IF A STONE BLOCKS EITHER THE
CYSTIC DUCT (THE TUBE THAT LEADS FROM THE GALLBLADDER TO THE BILE DUCT) OR THE BILE
DUCT (THE TUBE RUNNING FROM THE LIVER AND GALLBLADDER INTO THE INTESTINE).
GALLSTONE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE SUDDEN, INTENSE PAIN, USUALLY IN THE UPPER RIGHT
ABDOMEN, ACCOMPANIED BY FEVER, NAUSEA AND SOMETIMES VOMITING. AFTER ATTACKS
SUBSIDE, USUALLY IN A HALF-HOUR TO FOUR HOURS, SOME SORENESS MAY LINGER FOR A DAY
OR SO.
ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF WOMEN AND 8 PERCENT OF MEN OVER 40 HAVE SOME GALLSTONES, AND THESE FIGURES INCREASE WITH AGE.
PHYSICIANS TREAT GALLSTONES PRIMARILY WITH SURGERY, REMOVING THE GALLBLADDER
TO ELIMINATE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, HOWEVER, DOCTORS
HAVE HAD PROMISING RESULTS WITH A LESS INVASIVE FORM OF SURGERY CALLED LAPAROSCOPY, WHICH INVOLVES INSERTING A VIEWING DEVICE AND TINY INSTRUMENTS THROUGH
A SMALL INCISION. IN ADDITION, SOME CHOLESTEROL GALLSTONES CAN BE DISSOLVED WITH
THE USE OF BILE ACID DRUGS SUCH AS URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (ACTIGALL), GIVEN AS
TABLETS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GALLSTONES ANA KIDNEY STONES
THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT KIDNEY STONES IS TO DRINK SIX TO EIGHT GLASSES OF
WATER A DAY. THAT KEEPS THE URINE TOO DILUTE FOR STONES TO FORM. A VEGETARIAN
DIET ALSO HELPS BECAUSE IT'S HIGH IN MAGNESIUM, AND MAGNESIUM SUPPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENT KIDNEY STONES.
TO PREVENT GALLSTONES, EAT A LOW-FAT, LOW-CHOLESTEROL DIET, MEANING ONE
THAT'S VEGETARIAN OR CLOSE TO IT.
IF YOU HAVE THE BAD LUCK TO GET EITHER GALLSTONES OR KIDNEY STONES, I WOULD
URGE YOU TO FOLLOW YOUR PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE. I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT SOME
HERBS CAN HELP.
^ V BEGGAR-LICE (DESMODIUM STYRACIFOLIUM). THIS VINE GOT ITS NAME
FROM ITS SMALL, LOOSE FRUITS, WHICH CLING TO CLOTHING. IT HAS LONG BEEN USED BY THE
CHINESE FOR TREATING KIDNEY STONES, AND JAPANESE RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED
WHY IT WORKS. A COMPOUND IN THE PLANT WORKS BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM EXCRETED IN THE URINE AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CITRATE EXCRETED, SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF KIDNEY STONE FORMATION.
VV CELANDINE (CHELIDONIUM MA JUS). CELANDINE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN
206
GALLSTONE S AN D KIDNE Y STONE S
USED FOR TREATING THE LIVER, AND WITH GOOD REASON. IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS GAVE
TABLETS CONTAINING CHELIDONINE, AN ACTIVE COMPOUND IN CELANDINE, TO 60 PEOPLE
WITH SYMPTOMS OF GALLSTONES FOR SIX WEEKS. DOCTORS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS.
CHELIDONINE AND OTHER COMPOUNDS IN CELANDINE REPORTEDLY SOOTHE THE
SMOOTH MUSCLES OF THE BILIARY TRACT, IMPROVING BILE FLOW AND CURBING UPPER ABDOMINAL DISTRESS.
VV COUCHGRASS (AGROPYRON REPENS OR ELYTNUS REPENS). COMMISSION
E, THE EXPERT PANEL THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFIFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES FOR
THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, ENDORSES USING THIS HERB, ALSO KNOWN AS QUACKGRASS, FOR
PREVENTING KIDNEY STONES AND INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS OF THE URINARY TRACT.
I'D TRY MAKING A TEA WITH TWO TO TEN TEASPOONS OF THE UNDERGROUND PARTS OF
THE HERB. CHOP IT AND STEEP IT FOR FIVE TO TEN MINUTES IN A CUP OR TWO OF BOILING
WATER. EUROPEANS DRINK UP TO FOUR CUPS A DAY.
^ V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). HOT COMPRESSES MADE WITH
CONCENTRATED GINGER TEA SEEM TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE PAIN OF
KIDNEY STONE ATTACKS. THE COMPRESSES ACT AS COUNTERIRRITANTS BY CAUSING SUPERFICIAL SKIN IRRITATION, WHICH
TAKES THE MIND OFIFTHE DEEPER KIDNEY PAIN.
VV HORSETAIL (EQUI&ETUM ARVENSE). COMMISSION E APPROVES USING HORSETAIL FOR KIDNEY STONES
AND FOR THE GENERAL HEALTH OF THE URINARY TRACT. IT INCREASES URINE OUTPUT. (YOU SHOULD USE THIS HERB ONLY
IN CONSULTATION WITH A HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER.)
^V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA), SPEARMINT (M. SPICATA) AND OTHER MINTS. MINTS
HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO TREAT GALLSTONES.
ONE STONE-RELIEVING MIXTURE, A BRITISH OVER-THECOUNTER "GALLSTONE TEA" PREPARATION CALLED ROWACHOL, CONTAINS CHEMICALS FROM SEVERAL MEMBERS OF
THE MINT FAMILY. IN ONE BRITISH STUDY, THIS PRODUCT
HELPED A QUARTER OF THOSE WHO USED IT.
IF I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A DOCTOR DURING A
GALLSTONE ATTACK, I'D BREW WHAT I CALL STONE TEA
FROM AS MANY MINTS AS I COULD GATHER FROM THE
GARDEN OR STORE, ESPECIALLY PEPPERMINT AND
SPEARMINT, AN OLD FAVORITE. I'D ADD SOME CARDAMOM, THE RICHEST SOURCE OF BORNEOL, ANOTHER
COMPOUND THAT IS HELPFUL.
SPEARMINT
ONE OF MANY MEMBERS OF
THE MINT FAMILY, SPEARMINT
CAN HELP TREAT COUGHS AND
CHEST CONGESTION AS WELL AS
GALLSTONES.
207
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VV TURMERIC {CURCUMA LONGA). TURMERIC IS USEFUL FOR PREVENTING AND
TREATING GALLSTONES, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E. THIS ENDORSEMENT DOES NOT
SURPRISE ME, SINCE TURMERIC CONTAINS CURCUMIN, A COMPOUND THAT HAS BEEN
TESTED FOR ITS EFFECT ON GALLSTONES. IN ONE STUDY, MICE WITH EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED GALLSTONES WERE PLACED ON SPECIAL FEED CONTAINING A MODEST AMOUNT OF
CURCUMIN, AND WITHIN FIVE WEEKS THEIR GALLSTONE VOLUME HAD DROPPED 45 PERCENT. AFTER TEN WEEKS THEY HAD 80 PERCENT FEWER GALLSTONES THAN UNTREATED
MICE.
CURCUMIN INCREASES THE SOLUBILITY OF BILE, WHICH HELPS PREVENT THE FORMATION OF GALLSTONES AND HELPS ELIMINATE ANY STONES THAT HAVE FORMED. IF I HAD
GALLSTONES, I WOULD DEFINITELY COOK LOTS OF CURRIES—AND GO HEAVY ON THE
TURMERIC.
V GOLDENROD (SOLIDAGO VIRGAUREA). GOLDENROD CONTAINS THE COMPOUND
LEIOCARPOSIDE—A POTENT DIURETIC THAT HELPS THE BODY FLUSH EXCESS WATER. FVE SEEN
GOOD CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT GOLDENROD IS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC KIDNEY INFLAMMATION (NEPHRITIS). FOR BOTH OF THESE REASONS, I WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN COMMISSION E ENDORSED GOLDENROD FOR PREVENTING AND TREATING KIDNEY STONES.
THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS MAKING A TEA USING FIVE TEASPOONS OF
CHOPPED, DRIED FLOWERING SHOOTS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. THEY RECOMMEND
DRINKING THREE TO FOUR CUPS A DAY BETWEEN MEALS.
I WAS SURPRISED, HOWEVER, TO SEE COMMISSION E'S ENDORSEMENT OF THIS HERB
FOR GALLSTONES AS WELL. I'D SUGGEST TRYING IT FOR UP TO A MONTH IF YOU'RE NOT IN SERIOUS PAIN. AS A PREVENTIVE, BREW A TEA USING A LITTLE LESS HERB.
V JAVA TEA (ORTHOSIPHON ARISTATUS). THE LEAVES OF THIS HERB ARE APPROVED BY COMMISSION E FOR TREATING KIDNEY STONES. MAKE A TEA WITH THREE TO SIX
TEASPOONS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND DRINK IT ONCE A DAY. WHILE IT'S NOT EXACDY
CLEAR HOW JAVA TEA WORKS, THE SUSPICION IS THAT IT HELPS OPEN THE URETERS—THE TUBES
LEADING FROM THE KIDNEYS TO THE BLADDER—ALLOWING SMALL STONES TO BE PASSED.
V LOVAGE (LEVISTICUM OFFICINALE). FOR TREATING KIDNEY STONES, COMMISSION E SUGGESTS MAKING A TEA WITH TWO TO FOUR TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER AND DRINKING IT ONCE A DAY. LOVAGE IS A POTENT DIURETIC.
V MILK THISTLE (SILYBUM MARIANUM). RICH IN THE COMPOUND SILYMARIN,
MILK THISTLE IS BEST KNOWN FOR THE LIVER PROTECTION IT OFFERS. ACCORDING TO STUDIES,
SILYMARIN ALSO INCREASES BILE SOLUBILITY, THUS HELPING TO PREVENT OR ALLEVIATE GALLSTONES.
V PARSLEY (PETRO&ELINWN CRISPUM). PARSLEY IS A DIURETIC THAT HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT KIDNEY STONES. COMMISSION E APPROVES MAKING THE TEA USING ONE
TEASPOON OF DRIED ROOT AND SUGGESTS DRINKING TWO TO THREE CUPS A DAY. STEEP THE
HERB FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES, THEN STRAIN.
208
GENITAL HERPES AND COLD SORES
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). FINALLY, COMMISSION E ALSO RECOMMENDS DRINKING SEVERAL CUPS DAILY OF STINGING NETTLE TEA TO PREVENT AND TREAT
KIDNEY STONES. STEEP A TEASPOON OF FINELY CHOPPED DRIED HERB IN A CUP OF
BOILING WATER. OR BOIL UP SOME NETTLE GREENS AND ENJOY THE POTLIKKER WITH A
DASH OF VINEGAR, ONCE A DAY. YOU WILL NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING THE
LEAVES, BUT THE STINGING HAIRS LOSE THEIR STING WHEN THE PLANT IS COOKED, AND THE
GREENS ARE DELICIOUS.
GENITAL HERPES
AND COLD SORES
T
HE PHONE RANG. IT WAS A WOMAN WHO WANTED TO KNOW IF JUICE FROM
MAYAPPLE ROOTS WOULD HEAL HER GENITAL HERPES SORES.
I GET A LOT OF STRANGE QUESTIONS OUT OF THE BLUE, BUT THERE'S USUALLY A REASON
FOR THEM. THIS PARTICULAR WOMAN HAD HEARD ME SPEAK SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER AT
A SEMINAR ON SHAMANISTIC ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE. AT THAT TIME, I HAD MENTIONED
FOUR COMPOUNDS IN MAYAPPLE THAT TOGETHER GANG UP ON THE HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS.
WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS INDIVIDUALLY, YOU GET MUCH LESS ANTI-HERPES ACTION. THE "MAGIC BULLETS" THAT THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY SO LOVES TO EXTRACT FROM HERBS SIMPLY AREN'T THERE. IN
OTHER WORDS, WHEN IT COMES TO MAYAPPLE, THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF
ITS PARTS. THAT HAPPENS WITH A LOT OF HERBS, WHICH IS WHY I'M A WHOLE-HERB
HERBALIST.
I ADVISED AGAINST USING MAYAPPLE JUICE, AS IT CAN BE CAUSTIC, AND MAYAPPLE
RESIN IS DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS. BUT I DIDN'T LEAVE HER STRANDED. INSTEAD I ENDED
UP SETTLING ON A DIFFERENT HERB—LEMON BALM—TO TREAT HER PROBLEM. BUT BEFORE
WE GET INTO DISCUSSING ALL THE HERBS THAT I RECOMMEND FOR THIS PROBLEM, LET'S
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS HERPES BUG.
KNOW YOUR ENEMY
H. SIMPLEX COMES IN TWO FORMS, COLD SORES AND GENITAL HERPES. THIS VIRUS IS
A COUSIN TO H. ZOSTER, WHICH CAUSES ANOTHER TYPE OF PAINFUL SKIN LESION CALLED
SHINGLES. COLD SORES DEVELOP AROUND THE MOUTH, GENERALLY ON THE LIPS. IN WOMEN,
209
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
GENITAL HERPES OCCURS IN AND AROUND THE VAGINA AND CERVIX. IN MEN, IT SHOWS UP
ON AND AROUND THE PENIS. IN BOTH SEXES IT ALSO OCCURS AROUND THE ANUS.
HERPES IS VERY CONTAGIOUS, AND IT SHOWS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME PATTERN
WHETHER IT DEVELOPS ON THE MOUTH OR THE GENITALS.
FOLLOWING INITIAL CONTACT WITH THE VIRUS, THE FIRST SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY OCCUR
IN FOUR TO SEVEN DAYS. THESE INCLUDE TINGLING, BURNING OR A PERSISTENT ITCH, FOLLOWED A DAY OR SO LATER BY PIMPLE-LIKE BUMPS OVER REDDENED SKIN. THE PIMPLES TURN INTO PAINFUL BLISTERS THAT BURST AND EXUDE BLOOD AND YELLOWISH PUS.
FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE FIRST TINGLING, SCABS FORM AND HEALING BEGINS.
PEOPLE WITH ACTIVE LESIONS SHED THE VIRUS AND ARE CONTAGIOUS. BUT VIRAL
SHEDDING ALSO OCCURS DURING THE TINGLING STAGE BEFORE ANY SORE IS VISIBLE. THAT'S
ONE REASON THAT HERPES AFFECTS SO MANY PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT CAN'T ALWAYS
TELL WHEN THEY'RE CONTAGIOUS. ALTHOUGH MOST PEOPLE DEVELOP SORES WITHIN A
WEEK OF INFECTION, IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE INFECTED WITH THE VIRUS FOR QUITE SOME TIME
BEFORE DEVELOPING ANY SORES.
SOME 30 PERCENT OF AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE HAD EITHER ORAL OR GENITAL
HERPES. SOMETIMES THE LESIONS RECUR PERIODICALLY. SOMETIMES THEY APPEAR ONCE
AND NEVER AGAIN. AND SOMETIMES THEY RECUR FOR A WHILE AND THEN STOP. PROBABLY EVERYONE HARBORS THE VIRUS, BUT IT REMAINS DORMANT IN MOST PEOPLE.
TECHNICALLY, THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF HERPESVIRUS, ONE ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED
ORAL AND THE OTHER GENITAL. BUT ORAL SEX CAN SPREAD EACH TYPE FROM THE MOUTH
TO THE GENITALIA AND VICE VERSA, SO THE DISTINCTION IS INCREASINGLY MEANINGLESS.
AND IN ANY CASE, BOTH TYPES RESPOND TO TREATMENT WITH THE SAME HERBS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GENITAL HERPES ANA COLA SORES
NOW TO THE ANTI-HERPES HERBAL LINEUP. HERE ARE THE LEADERS OF THE VIRUSFIGHTING PACK.
W V LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS). ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA, LEMON
BALM'S DEMONSTRATED ANTIVIRAL, ANTI-HERPES PROPERTIES SEEM TO RESULT FROM COMPOUNDS IN THE HERB, INCLUDING TANNINS, THAT ARE KNOWN AS POLYPHENOLS. HERE'S HOW
THESE COMPOUNDS WORK TO TAME HERPES OUTBREAKS.
THE BODY'S CELLS HAVE RECEPTORS THAT VIRUSES LATCH ON TO WHEN THEY'RE TRYING
TO TAKE OVER THE CELLS. THE POLYPHENOL COMPOUNDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO LATCH ON
TO THE CELLS* VIRAL RECEPTOR SITES. THEY TAKE UP THOSE SPACES AND PREVENT THE
VIRUSES FROM ATTACHING TO THE CELL, THUS PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF INFECTION.
THIS IS A FIRST-CHOICE HERBAL TREATMENT. IN FACT, I TOLD THE WOMAN WHO WAS
DESPERATELY SEEKING SOMETHING TO HEAL HER HERPES SORES THAT FD PERSONALLY RECOMMEND MAKING MIXED MINT TEA, HEAVY WITH LEMON BALM. SHE COULD DRINK THE
TEA, THEN APPLY THE DREGS FROM THE TEA BAGS DIRECTLY TO THE LESIONS.
210
GENITA L HERPE S AN D COL D SORE S
MINTS, ESPECIALLY LEMON BALM,
CONTAIN ANTIOXIDANT VITAMINS AND
SELENIUM, WHICH STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. (ANTIOXIDANTS ARE
CHEMICALS THAT MOP UP FREE RADICALS, THE NATURALLY OCCURRING OXYGEN
MOLECULES THAT DAMAGE THE BODY'S
CELLS.) ALL MINTS ALSO CONTAIN AT
LEAST FOUR ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS THAT
TARGET THE HERPESVIRUS.
NOT TOO LONG AGO IN PERU, NATUROPATH STEPHEN MORRIS, N.D., TAUGHT
OUR AMAZONIAN MEDICINE WORKSHOP HOW TO MAKE OUR OWN HERPES
OINTMENT. WE CAREFULLY HEATED SOME
OLIVE OR PALM OIL, INCORPORATING
MELTED BEESWAX AT A 1:4 RATIO. TO
THE CREAM, WE ADDED POWDERED
LEMON BALM, MIXED AND STRAINED IT
AND THEN ALLOWED IT TO COOL. OUR
HOST, SOCORRO, SMILED AS WE DID ALL
THIS OVER AN OPEN FIRE IN HER OPENAIR, OUTDOOR "KITCHEN."
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO GET THIS
ELABORATE, HOWEVER. VARRO TYLER,
PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS
OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT
PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN
WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, AND AUTHOR 1J
OF THE HONEST HERBAL, TENDS TO BE
CONSERVATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO
HERBS. DR. TYLER SAYS THAT YOU CAN GET RESULTS BY USING TOPICAL APPLICATIONS OF
LEMON BALM TEA, WHICH YOU CAN BREW USING TWO TO FOUR TEASPOONS OF HERB PER CUP
OF BOILING WATER. THEN APPLY IT WITH A COTTON BALL SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
"THIS TREATMENT IS PROBABLY AS EFFECTIVE AS ANY OTHER SELF-SELECTED REMEDY
FOR COLD SORES," SAYS DR. TYLER.
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS CONEFLOWER, ECHINACEA HAS BEEN SHOWN IN MANY STUDIES TO HAVE BOTH ANTIVIRAL AND IMMUNE-STIMULATING PROPERTIES.
EUROPEAN KNOW-HOW
THINK AMERICANS HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING? GUESS AGAIN. WHEN IT COMES TO
HERBS, EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ARE
OFTEN BETTER THAN OUR OWN.
AN HERBAL OINTMENT FOR TREATING
HERPES, WHICH IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE, HAS LEMON BALM AS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT. THE HERBAL CONTENT IS QUITE
CONCENTRATED—700 MILLIGRAMS OF DRY LEAF
MATERIAL PER GRAM OF OINTMENT.
IN A RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC TEST OF 116
PEOPLE WITH HERPES, THE OINTMENT CONTAINING LEMON BALM WAS 2.5 TIMES AS EFFECTIVE AS A SIMILAR CREAM WITHOUT THE
HERB (A PLACEBO). THE HERBAL PRODUCT WAS
ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE WHEN TREATMENT WAS
BEGUN EARLY, AS THE LESIONS WERE FIRST
ERUPTING.
IN ANOTHER STUDY INVOLVING 115
PEOPLE USING LEMON BALM, 96 PERCENT HAD
HEALED COMPLETELY BY DAY 8, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. NORMALLY IT TAKES
ANYWHERE FROM 10 TO 14 DAYS FOR HERPES
SORES TO HEAL. IF I HAD HERPES, AND IF EUROPEAN LEMON BALM CREAM WERE AVAILABLE
HERE, FD TRY IT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS NOT, SO
I STICK WITH MY GARDEN MELISSA.
211
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING CASE REPORT FROM THE BRITISH JOURNAL OF
PHYTOTHERAPY: AFTER SUFFERING FOR 12 YEARS WITH RECURRENT GENITAL HERPES, A MAN
TOOK ECHINACEA. HE FOUND THAT IF HE TOOK IT WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER HE NOTICED THE INITIAL TINGLING, HE HAD FAR LESS PAIN AND THE OUTBREAK STOPPED.
HERBALISTS GENERALLY RECOMMEND TAKING ECHINACEA IN A TINCTURE. ADD ABOUT
A HALF-TEASPOON OF THE TINCTURE TO TEA OR JUICE AND TAKE IT THREE TIMES A DAY.
SOME TINCTURES ARE A MIXTURE OF ECHINACEA AND GOLDENSEAL, WHICH ALSO HAS
ANTIMICROBIAL, IMMUNE-STIMULATING BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE
THE TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS. SOME
HERBALISTS RELY ON THIS REACTION TO ASSURE THEM THAT THEY HAVE ECHINACEA AND
NOT SOME ADULTERANT. (ADULTERANTS IN COMMERCIAL HERB PREPARATIONS ARE AN ONGOING PROBLEM.)
W MINT FAMILY HERBS. LEMON BALM IS NOT THE ONLY MINT WITH ANTIVIRAL,
ANTI-HERPES ACTIVITY. THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER HERBS IN THE MINT FAMILY
THAT ARE ALMOST AS EFFECTIVE.
HERE'S WHERE I PLUG MY HAPPY HERPICIDE TEA, WHICH IS MADE FROM SEVERAL
HERBS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE MINT FAMILY: HYSSOP, LEMON BALM, OREGANO, ROSEMARY, SAGE, SELF-HEAL (YES, THIS IS THE NAME OF A WIDELY AVAILABLE HERB) AND
THYME.
TO MAKE THE TEA, FILL A SAUCEPAN HALF FULL OF WATER. BRING THE WATER TO A BOIL,
THEN ADD FRESH LEMON BALM LEAVES UNTIL THE PAN IS ABOUT THREE-QUARTERS FULL. IF
YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH LEAVES, YOU CAN USE ABOUT A QUARTER-CUP OF DRIED
LEMON BALM. (THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH AMOUNT OF HERB FOR BREWING A TEA, BUT
YOU REALLY NEED A LOT OF IT TO GET THE ANTIVIRAL ACTION THAT YOU WANT.) TO THE LEMON
BALM AND WATER, ADD TWO PARTS EACH OF DRIED OREGANO AND SELF-HEAL AND ONE PART
EACH OF HYSSOP, ROSEMARY, SAGE AND THYME.
ASIDE FROM THE LEMON BALM, THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS OF THE OTHER HERBS DON'T
MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE; JUST MAKE SURE YOU USE TWICE AS MUCH OF THE OREGANO
AND SELF-HEAL AS YOU DO OF THE OTHERS. FINALLY, TOSS IN A LITTLE LICORICE ROOT TO
SWEETEN THE TEA AND STEEP IT FOR 20 MINUTES.
THIS MIXTURE CONTAINS A DOZEN COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ACTIVE AGAINST HERPES.
THE LIST OF CHEMICALS IN THIS BREW IS RATHER IMPOSING, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT
YOU GET FOR GOING TO ALL THIS TROUBLE: CAFFEIC ACID, GERANIIN, GLYCYRRHIZIC ACID,
GLYCYRRHIZIN, LYSINE, PROTOCATECHUIC ACID, QUERCETIN, ROSMARINIC ACID, TANNIC
ACID, THYMOL, TOCOPHEROL AND ZINC.
V * RED PEPPE R (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES)* THE HOT INGREDIENT IN
RED PEPPER IS CAPSAICIN. TESTS ON LABORATORY ANIMALS SHOW THAT CAPSAICIN CAN
PREVENT OUTBREAKS OF HERPES IN THE EYE FOR UP TO TWO MONTHS, AND TOPICAL CAPSAICIN PREPARATIONS (ZOSTRIX, CAPZASIN-P) ARE USED TO RELIEVE THE PAIN OF SHIN212
GENITA L HERPE S AND COL D SORES
GLES. (IF YOU USE CAPSAICIN CREAM, ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING IT IN YOUR EYES. ALSO, YOU SHOULD TEST IT
ON A SMALL AREA OF SKIN BEFORE USING IT ON A LARGER AREA. IF YOU EXPERIENCE IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.)
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND SPRINKLING CAYENNE ON ANY HERPES LESIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE EYE, SINCE THAT COULD REALLY HURT. BUT WHY NOT SEASON YOUR
HAPPY HERPICIDE TEA WITH HOT-PEPPER SAUCE? ALTHOUGH YOU DRINK IT RATHER
THAN DAB IT ON, YOU'LL STILL BENEFIT FROM THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.
VV ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). ONE COMPOUND IN ST.-
JOHN'S-WORT, HYPERICIN, HELPS KILL H. SIMPLEX AND SEVERAL OTHER VIRUSES. ALTHOUGH OINTMENTS CONTAINING HYPERICIN ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST HERPES SORES, YOU
DON'T NEED TO BUY ONE. TRY BREWING A STRONG TEA, AND AFTER IT COOLS, DAB IT ON
WITH COTTON BALLS.
V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). IN TEST-TUBE STUDIES, GARLIC HAS SHOWN VIRICIDAL EFFECTS AGAINST BOTH TYPES OF HERPESVIRUS AND MANY OTHER VIRUSES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT CAUSE COLDS AND FLU. YOU CAN MAKE GARLIC INTO A TEA, BUT YOU
WILL PROBABLY ENJOY IT A WHOLE LOT MORE IF YOU JUST TOSS A FEW MINCED CLOVES ONTO
A PLATE OF PASTA OR ADD THEM TO A MIXED GREEN SALAD.
V AMINO ACIDS. NOW LET'S WIGGLE A TOE INTO NUTRITIONAL WATERS. AN AMINO
ACID, ARGININE, IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR VIRAL REPLICATION. A PREPONDERANCE
OF ANOTHER AMINO ACID, LYSINE, OVER ARGININE IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPRESS VIRAL REPLICATION. HENCE, THOSE WHO VALUE THIS THEORY SEEK FOODS WITH A HIGH-LYSINE, LOWARGININE CONTENT. SEVERAL PLANTS HAVE HIGH-LYSINE/LOW-ARGININE RATIOS,
INCLUDING STAR FRUIT (NEARLY 4:1), PAPAYA (ABOUT 3:1) AND GRAPEFRUIT, APRICOT,
PEAR, APPLE AND FIG (AROUND 2:1).
SOME PEOPLE TAKE A DAILY SUPPLEMENT OF 1,300 MILLIGRAMS OF LYSINE AT THE
FIRST INKLING OF A HERPES OUTBREAK. IT WOULD TAKE A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO POUNDS OF
FRESH WATERCRESS TO PROVIDE THAT AMOUNT, BUT ONLY A HALF-CUP OF DRIED WATERCRESS. WHILE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO EAT THIS MUCH WATERCRESS, THERE ARE A FEW
OTHER FOODS THAT WILL GIVE YOU A FAIRLY HEFTY DOSE OF LYSINE.
A CUP OF BLACK BEANS, LENTILS, SOYBEANS OR WINGED BEANS PROVIDES MORE
THAN 2,500 MILLIGRAMS OF LYSINE. IF YOU'RE MAKING BEAN SOUP WITH THESE INGREDIENTS, SPICE IT WELL WITH HOT-PEPPER SAUCE FOR A LITTLE EXTRA ANTI-HERPES ACTION.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS NOTE THAT COMBINATIONS OF ESSENTIAL OILS, SUCH AS LEMON AND GERANIUM OR EUCALYPTUS AND BERGAMOT, CAN BE
HELPFUL AGAINST HERPES IF APPLIED AT THE FIRST SIGN OF AN OUTBREAK. SOME AROMATHERAPISTS SAY THAT ROSE OIL AND LEMON BALM OIL HAVE CONTRIBUTED, IN SOME
CASES, TO COMPLETE REMISSION OF H. SIMPLEX LESIONS, SOMETIMES AFTER ONLY ONE APPLICATION.
213
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THIS APPROACH SEEMS WORTH A TRY. YOU CAN APPLY ANY OF THESE OILS TOPICALLY
USING A COTTON BALL.
WARNING: ESSENTIAL OILS ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED PLANT EXTRACTS. MAKE SURE
YOU NEVER INGEST THEM UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED BY A REPUTABLE HERBALIST
OR AROMATHERAPIST. SMALL QUANTITIES OF SOME OILS, ON THE ORDER OF A SINGLE TEASPOON, CAN BE FATAL.
V DRUG-HERB COMBINATION. I'LL REPORT NEWS OF A SURPRISING STUDY BY
JAPANESE SCIENTISTS. THEY COMBINED THE PHARMACEUTICAL ANTI-HERPES DRUG, ACYCLOVIR (ZOVIRAX), WITH ANY ONE OF FOUR TANNIN-RICH HERBAL EXTRACTS: JAPANESE AVENS
(GEUM JAPONICUM), JAVANESE SUMAC (RHUS JAVANICA), CLOVES (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM) AND CHEBULA (TERMINALIA CHEBULA). THE COMBINATION TREATMENT WORKED
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN ACYCLOVIR ALONE OR THE HERBS ALONE. BECAUSE ACYCLOVIR IS
A PRESCRIPTION DRUG, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT TRYING THIS ONE.
V HEALING BEVERAGES. TEA AND THE JUICES OF APPLE, CRANBERRY, GRAPE, PEAR,
PRUNE AND STRAWBERRY ALL SEEM TO HELP KILL VIRUSES. TANNINS ARE USUALLY THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS IN THESE JUICES. PEAR JUICE, WHICH IS RICH IN ANTI-HERPES CAFFEIC
ACID, MIGHT BE YOUR BEST JUICE CHOICE.
GINGIVITIS
A
MERICAN INDIANS USED BLOODROOT AS AN ORAL ANTISEPTIC. MODERN RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY SOLID SCIENCE TO BACK UP THIS
ANCIENT PRACTICE. THE RED ROOT OF THIS HERB—FROM WHICH THE PLANT'S NAME IS DERIVED—CONTAINS THE ANTISEPTIC COMPOUND SANGUINARINE. THIS COMPOUND, WHICH
IS NOW USED IN A FEW ORAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS, HAS THE REMARKABLE ABILITY TO PREVENT BACTERIA FROM FORMING PLAQUE.
THAT'S A POWERFUL FORM OF DENTAL CARE, BECAUSE WHEN BACTERIA FORM GUMMY
PLAQUE ON TEETH, IT CAUSES THE GUM DISEASE GINGIVITIS. SO ANYTHING THAT GETS RID
OF PLAQUE IS REALLY A WAY TO HEAD OFF GUM PROBLEMS.
THESE ARE THE FACTS. BUT I GOT CAUGHT UP IN A CONTROVERSY WHEN I ADVOCATED
WIDER USE OF BLOODROOT IN TOOTHPASTES AND MOUTHWASHES. WHEN I SUBMITTED A
PRO-BLOODROOT ARTICLE FOR A CONSERVATIONIST WILDFLOWER JOURNAL, THE EDITOR SENT
THE ARTICLE OUT FOR REVIEW TO A LEADING ETHNODENTIST, SOMEONE WHO INVESTIGATES
THE USE OF PLANT SUBSTANCES AROUND THE WORLD FOR TREATING TOOTH AND GUM PROBLEMS. THE ETHNODENTIST URGED THAT THE ARTICLE BE REJECTED.
214
GINGIVITI S
SINCE THIS MAN'S REACTION WAS ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED, I DID SOME CHECKING
ON MY OWN. IT SEEMS THAT THIS PARTICULAR ETHNODENTIST WAS BUSILY PROMOTING ANOTHER HERBAL ORAL ANTISEPTIC, NEEM, AND WAS DEAD SET AGAINST BLOODROOT.
THE ETHNODENTIST MAINTAINED THAT BLOODROOT'S ACTIVE CONSTITUENT, SANGUINARINE, CAUSED CANCER AND GLAUCOMA, WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO BE A SERIOUS
EXAGGERATION. SANGUINARINE IS LESS TOXIC AND PRESUMABLY LESS CARCINOGENIC THAN
CAFFEINE. NOT ONLY THAT, WHEN IT'S USED IN TOOTHPASTES AND MOUTHWASHES, YOU
SPIT IT OUT RATHER THAN SWALLOWING IT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD BE VERY
HARMFUL, AT LEAST UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.
I HAVE USED TOOTHPASTE CONTAINING SANGUINARINE—WITHOUT FEAR, I MIGHT
ADD. I THINK BOTH SANGUINARINE AND NEEM SHOULD BE AVAILABLE, BUT PERSONALLY, I
PREFER THE SANGUINARINE.
GAUM SERVICE
GINGIVITIS MEANS "INFLAMMATION OF THE GUMS." IT CAUSES SWELLING, REDNESS,
A CHANGE IN NORMAL GUM CONTOURS, WATERY DISCHARGE AND BLEEDING. WHEN IT GETS
MORE SERIOUS, IT BECOMES PYORRHEA, DEGENERATION OF THE GUM TISSUE SUPPORTING
THE TEETH. TOGETHER, GINGIVITIS AND PYORRHEA ARE KNOWN AS PERIODONTAL DISEASE,
A PROBLEM THAT ALL OF US ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE AS WE GET OLDER.
AT AGE 10, ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE AT LEAST A MILD FORM OF GINGIVITIS. AT AGE 20, SOME 38 PERCENT HAVE IT, AND AT 50, ABOUT HALF. PEOPLE WHO
DON'T BRUSH, FLOSS OR GET REGULAR DENTAL CARE ARE AT GREATEST RISK.
BUT YOU CAN GET GINGIVITIS EVEN IF YOU DO BRUSH AND FLOSS, BECAUSE BRUSHING
AND FLOSSING DON'T CLEAN OUT THE DEEP, BACTERIA-HARBORING POCKETS BETWEEN THE
TEETH AND GUMS. FOR THOSE AREAS YOU NEED A LITTLE EXTRA HELP.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GINGIVITIS
DENTISTS TREAT GINGIVITIS BY IRRIGATING THE DEEP POCKETS WITH ANTISEPTICS.
BUT IF YOU WANT AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE TO GUM CARE, HERE ARE SOME HERBS THAT CAN
ALSO HELP.
W BLOODROOT (SANGUINARIA CANADENSIS). MY ADVOCACY OF THE COMPOUND SANGUINARINE, FOUND IN BLOODROOT, IS BACKED UP BY MANY WELL-DESIGNED
STUDIES. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TOOTHPASTE CONTAINING SANGUINARINE IS MODESTLY
EFFECTIVE AGAINST SEVERAL TYPES OF ORAL BACTERIA AND THAT IT HELPS REDUCE THE
AMOUNT OF DENTAL PLAQUE IN THE MOUTH IN AS LITTLE AS EIGHT DAYS.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS HERB, LOOK FOR SANGUINARINE IN THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS ON THE LABELS OF TOOTHPASTES AND MOUTHWASHES. THE MOST WIDELY AVAILABLE
BRAND IS VIADENT.
215
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IN ADDITION TO THEIR USE IN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS, BLOODROOT EXTRACTS
ARE USED BY DENTISTS TO TREAT PERIODONTAL DISEASE.
VV CAMOMILE {MATRICARIA RECUTITA). COMMISSION £, THE PANEL OF EXPERTS
THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES FOR THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, CONSIDERS CAMOMILE EFFECTIVE AS A GARGLE OR MOUTHWASH FOR TREATING GINGIVITIS. CAMOMILE CONTAINS SEVERAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
IN ADDITION TO TREATING GUM DISEASE, YOU CAN USE CAMOMILE TO HELP PREVENT
IT. TRY BREWING A STRONG CAMOMILE TEA USING TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF HERB PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES, STRAIN, AND DRINK AFTER MEALS. OR
USE IT AS A MOUTHWASH. WHILE ETHNODENTISTS CAUTION THAT CAMOMILE, BECAUSE
IT'S KIN TO RAGWEED, MAY CAUSE ALLERGIES, IN MY EXPERIENCE IT IS VERY RARE. IF YOU
DO NOTICE AN ALLERGIC REACTION—ITCHING OR ANY DISCOMFORT—DISCONTINUE USE OF
THIS HERB.
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). IN THE HANDBOOK FOR
HERBAL HEALINGS CALIFORNIA HERBALIST AND BOTANIST CHRISTOPHER HOBBS RECOMMENDS
ECHINACEA FOR TREATING GINGIVITIS, AMONG MANY OTHER CONDITIONS. THE HERB IS ANTIBACTERIAL AND IMMUNE-STIMULATING. ADD A DROPPER OR TWO OF ECHINACEA TINCTURE TO
ANTI-GINGIVITIS TEAS AND MOUTHWASHES. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN
CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY,
THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE IS A SWEETENER THAT WON'T
CAUSE CAVITIES OR GINGIVITIS. TRY IT IN TEAS
INSTEAD OF SUGAR OR HONEY. IN ADDITION,
LICORICE IS HIGH IN MAGNESIUM AND THE
COMPOUND GLYCYRRHIZIN, WHICH SOME
STUDIES SUGGEST HELP CONTROL GUM INFLAMMATION AND PLAQUE FORMATION.
WHILE LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE
SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE
AMOUNTS—UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF
TEA A DAY—LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION
OF LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER
RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
W PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). FOODS HIGH IN MAGNESIUM AND
VITAMIN C HAVE OFTEN BEEN RECOMLICPRICE
USED BY HERBALISTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES,
LICORICE IS NOW OFTEN SUGGESTED FOR RELIEF
OF COLDS, SORE THROATS AND ULCERS AS WELL
AS GINGIVITIS.
216
GINGIVITIS
' MENDED FOR TREATING GUM DISEASE. BECAUSE I AM A BIG FAN OF SPINACHLIKE PURSLANE,
I CAN'T HELP SUGGESTING IT AS A GOOD SOURCE OF MAGNESIUM. SEVERAL OTHER HERBS, INCLUDING CORIANDER, COWPEAS, DANDELION, LICORICE ROOT, LETTUCE LEAF, POPPY SEEDS,
SPINACH, STINGING NETDE GREENS AND STRING BEANS ARE HIGH IN MAGNESIUM AS WELL.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY MAGNESIUM MEDLEY FOR KEEPING GINGIVITIS AT BAY:
STEAM A MIXED MESS OF DANDELION, STINGING NETTLE GREENS, PURSLANE AND SPINACH
) LEAVES. (REMINDER: YOU'LL NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING NETTLE GREENS,
BUT THE STINGING HAIRS LOSE THEIR STING WHEN THE LEAVES ARE COOKED.)
VV SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). IN THE EUROPEAN HERBAL FOLK TRADITION, SAGE
LEAVES, WHICH ARE RATHER GRITTY, ARE RUBBED ON THE GUMS AND TEETH AS A STIMULANT
DENTIFRICE. FVE DONE THIS, AND IT SEEMS TO HELP, THANKS TO SAGE'S ASTRINGENT TANNIN
, AND SEVERAL AROMATIC ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS. I FIND SAGE LEAVES IN MY HERB GARDEN
ALMOST YEAR-ROUND, AND COLLECTING THESE LEAVES IS A LOT CHEAPER THAN BUYING PRODUCTS CONTAINING SANGUINARINE. SAGE TEA IS PERHAPS AS EFFECTIVE AS A SANGUINARINE
1
 TOOTHPASTE.
) SOME MODERN RESEARCH APPEARS TO SUPPORT THIS FOLK MEDICINE APPROACH.
COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED SAGE LEAVES PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER TO MAKE AN ANTI-GINGIVITIS TEA. IT'S BEST, THOUGH, TO USE SAGE
IN MODERATION, AS IT CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THUJONE, A COMPOUND THAT IN VERY
' HIGH DOSES MAY CAUSE CONVULSIONS.
) VV TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). LIKE SAGE, TEA IS ASTRINGENT, WHICH HELPS FEND
;
 OFF THE BACTERIA RESPONSIBLE FOR TOOTH DECAY AND GINGIVITIS. TEA ALSO CONTAINS AT
LEAST FIVE ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS. SWEETEN IT WITH LICORICE.
' V CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). WITH ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTIVIRAL AND
) IMMUNE-STIMULATING PROPERTIES, CALENDULA EXTRACTS MAY BE USEFUL IN TREATING GINI GIVITIS. JUST BEWARE IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, THOUGH, BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLERGIC
TO RAGWEED MIGHT BE ALLERGIC TO THIS PLANT AS WELL. AND IF YOU TAKE IT AND HAVE A
' REACTION—ITCHING OR ANY OTHER DISCOMFORT—DISCONTINUE USE.
' V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). YOU CAN'T COUNT ON THE "PEPPERMINT"
) IN TOOTHPASTES TO BE OF ANY HELP IN PREVENTING GINGIVITIS, AS MOST PRODUCTS ARE AR-
, TIFICIALLY FLAVORED THESE DAYS. BUT REAL PEPPERMINT FIGHTS THE BACTERIA THAT CAUSE
TOOTH DECAY. YOU CAN MAKE A TEA USING TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED PEPPERMINT
LEAVES PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES, THEN SWEETEN IT WITH LICORICE
AND DRINK THE TEA OR USE IT AS A MOUTHWASH. YOU CAN ALSO CHEW FRESH MINT LEAVES
) INSTEAD OF SWEETENED MINT CANDIES AND GUMS.
V RHATANY (KRAMERIA TRIANDRA). COMMISSION E APPROVES OF USING
RHATANY BARK TO TREAT GINGIVITIS. LIKE TEA, THIS HERB IS RICH IN ASTRINGENT, ANTISEPTIC
J
 TANNIN. TO MAKE A RHATANY TEA, STEEP A TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB IN A CUP OF BOILING
WATER. DRINK IT OR USE IT AS AN ASTRINGENT MOUTHWASH.
217
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V STINGING NETTLE (TJRTICA DIOICA). IN ADDITION TO THE MAGNESIUM IN
NETTLE GREENS, RUSSIAN STUDIES SHOW THAT NETTLE TEA HAS ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY.
MOUTHWASHES AND TOOTHPASTES CONTAINING NETTLE REDUCE PLAQUE AND GINGIVITIS. IT'S
EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IF YOU ADD JUNIPER. LOOK FOR DENTAL PRODUCTS CONTAINING THESE
HERBS AT HEALTH FOOD STORES.
V TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). TEATREE OIL IS A SIGNIFICANT
ANTISEPTIC, AND MANY HERBALISTS REGARD IT AS THEIR FIRST-CHOICE DISINFECTANT FOR EXTERNAL USE. BUT IF YOU'RE USING TEATREE TO TREAT GINGIVITIS AND CANKER SORES, MAKE
SURE YOU DON'T SWALLOW IT.
TO COMBAT GINGIVITIS, ADD A COUPLE OF DROPS OF TEATREE OIL TO A GLASS OF WATER,
THEN SWISH IT IN YOUR MOUTH. AS WITH ANY OTHER ESSENTIAL OIL, TEATREE SHOULD
NEVER BE TAKEN INTERNALLY, AS SURPRISINGLY SMALL AMOUNTS—A TEASPOON OR SO—
CAN BE FATAL.
V WATERCRESS (NASTURTIUM OFFICINALE). PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL
PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D., AUTHOR OF CHINESE HERBAL REMEDIES, TELLS
THE STORY OF HOW WATERCRESS WAS INTRODUCED INTO CHINA A LITTLE OVER 100 YEARS AGO.
IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY CHINA, ANCESTRAL HOME OF DR. LEUNG'S FAMILY, PEOPLE
USED TO CALL SAN FRANCISCO GUM SAN, WHICH MEANS "GOLDEN MOUNTAIN." YOUNG
MEN LEFT CHINA FOR GUM SAN, HOPING TO FIND FAME AND FORTUNE.
ONCE IN SAN FRANCISCO, THEY WERE HAULED OFF TO WORK ON THE RAILROAD, AND
MANY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS. LEGEND HAS IT THAT THEY DISCOVERED THROUGH DESPERATE EXPERIMENTATION THAT WATERCRESS HELPED TREAT TUBERCULOSIS. SOME WHO
RECOVERED AFTER EATING IT DECIDED TO TAKE THE SECRET HOME TO CHINA. WITH WHAT
MONEY THEY HAD SAVED AND THE SEEDS OF THE LIFESAVING PLANT, THEY RETURNED TO
THEIR HOMELAND.
TODAY SOUTHERN CHINESE CHEW WATERCRESS TO TREAT SORE GUMS. IF YOU LIKE THE
TASTE OF WATERCRESS, YOU MIGHT TRY CHEWING IT TO TREAT GINGIVITIS.
GLAUCOMA
G
LAUCOMA IS A LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS. IT TYPICALLY DEVELOPS AFTER
AGE 40 AND BECOMES INCREASINGLY COMMON WITH AGE. ABOUT 3 PERCENT
OF AMERICANS OVER AGE 65 HAVE IT—SOME TWO MILLION PEOPLE, ABOUT 60,000 OF
WHOM ARE LEGALLY BLIND.
GLAUCOMA IS A GROUP OF EYE DISEASES THAT INVOLVE AN INCREASE IN FLUID PRES218
GLAUCOM A
SURE IN THE EYE (INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE) THAT DEVELOPS WHEN THE DRAINAGE MECHANISM FOR THIS FLUID BECOMES IMPAIRED. THE INCREASED PRESSURE DAMAGES THE
OPTIC NERVE, CAUSING BLIND SPOTS IN THE FIELD OF VISION.
IN ADDITION TO BLIND SPOTS, GLAUCOMA SYMPTOMS INCLUDE BLURRED VISION, LOSS
OF PERIPHERAL VISION, HALOS AROUND LIGHTS, EYE PAIN AND REDNESS. WHEN DIAGNOSED AND TREATED, GLAUCOMA IS EASILY CONTROLLED. IT'S ONLY WHEN THE DISEASE
GOES UNDETECTED AND UNTREATED THAT IT CAN LEAD TO BLINDNESS. AN ESTIMATED
500,000 AMERICANS HAVE UNDIAGNOSED GLAUCOMA.
GLAUCOMA IS A SERIOUS ILLNESS, AND EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A FAMILY
HISTORY OF THIS DISEASE, SHOULD HAVE THEIR INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE CHECKED PERIODICALLY. ANYONE WITH GLAUCOMA MUST BE UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE. THE CAUSE REMAINS A MYSTERY, BUT APPARENTLY A TENDENCY TOWARD GLAUCOMA CAN BE INHERITED.
MAINSTREAM PHYSICIANS TYPICALLY TREAT GLAUCOMA WITH A VARIETY OF DRUGS
THAT REDUCE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, MANY OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM HERBAL
SOURCES. IN SOME PEOPLE, THE PRESSURE MUST BE REDUCED SURGICALLY BY OPENING
UP THE EYES' DRAINAGE TUBES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GLAUCOMA
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE HELPFUL IN TREATING
GLAUCOMA.
VVV JABORANDI (PILOCARPUS^ VARIOUS SPECIES). ONE STANDARD GLAUCOMA
MEDICINE, PILOCARPINE, IS ACTUALLY DERIVED FROM JABORANDI, A TROPICAL TREE THAT
GROWS IN SOUTH AMERICA. JABORANDI WAS WIDELY USED IN FOLK MEDICINE LONG BEFORE
THE SPANISH EXPLORERS ARRIVED. WHEN THEY DID, THEY QUICKLY LEARNED OF ITS VALUE.
AS EARLY AS 1648, SPANISH NATURALISTS HINTED AT THE ABILITY OF THIS HERB TO
TREAT EYE DISEASE. THEN IN 1875, PILOCARPINE WAS FIRST ISOLATED FROM JABORANDI.
IT WAS SYNTHESIZED IN 1930.
SINCE PILOCARPINE REDUCES INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE, IT IS OFTEN PRESCRIBED IN THE
FORM OF EYEDROPS TO TREAT SEVERAL TYPES OF GLAUCOMA. ONE APPLICATION TAKES EFFECT
IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES AND CONTINUES TO PROTECT THE EYE FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS.
CHANCES ARE THAT TODAY PEOPLE WITH GLAUCOMA WHO USE PILOCARPINE APPLY THE SYNTHETIC VERSION, BUT THIS STANDARD MEDICATION IS ACTUALLY AN HERBAL DERIVATIVE.
W FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTAINING VITAMIN C. MANY STUDIES SHOW
THAT VITAMIN C LOWERS INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE. GOOD SOURCES INCLUDE BELL PEPPERS,
BROCCOLI, CABBAGE, CITRUS FRUITS, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, GUAVA, KALE, PARSLEY AND STRAWBERRIES.
NUTRITIONISTS AND NATUROPATHS OFTEN RECOMMEND TAKING VITAMIN C SUPPLE-
' MENTS IN AMOUNTS RANGING ANYWHERE FROM 2,000 TO 35,000 MILLIGRAMS A DAY.
! SINCE AS LITTLE AS 1,200 MILLIGRAMS OF VITAMIN C CAN CAUSE DIARRHEA IN SOME
219
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
%
PEOPLE, I'D SUGGEST STAYING ON THE LOWER SIDE. IF YOU WANT TO TRY HIGHER DOSES,
PLEASE DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. IF I HAD GLAUCOMA OR A FAMILY HISTORY OF THE
DISEASE, I'D TAKE SUPPLEMENTAL VITAMIN C.
VV KAFFIR POTATO (COLEUS FORSKOHTII). THIS HERB CONTAINS A COMPOUND,
FORSKOLIN, THAT LOWERS INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE. STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT A
«^ FORSKOLIN PREPARATION IN THE FORM OF EYEDROPS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES INTRAOCULAR
PRESSURE IN JUST ONE HOUR. IN THE STUDIES,
THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT REACHED ITS PEAK
AT TWO HOURS AND REMAINED SIGNIFICANT
FOR AT LEAST FIVE.
THIS IS NOT AN HERB THAT YOU WOULD
USE ON YOUR OWN, BUT IF YOU HAVE GLAUCOMA AND USE PHARMACEUTICAL
FORSKOLIN, YOU MIGHT ENJOY KNOWING
THAT YOU'RE USING A MEDICINE THAT WAS
DERIVED FROM AN HERB.
V%. OREGANO (ORIGANUM VULGARE). NONE OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE
SEEMS STRONG ON PREVENTIVE ADVICE, SO IF
GLAUCOMA RUNS IN YOUR FAMILY, YOU MIGHT
FIND THIS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING.
NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND GETTING
PLENTY OF FOODS CONTAINING ANTIOXIDANTS
TO PREVENT GLAUCOMA. ANTIOXIDANTS ARE
SUBSTANCES THAT NEUTRALIZE THE NATURALLY OCCURRING, HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN
< _ .__ „ ,, ,, J MOLECULES (FREE RADICALS) IN THE BODY
THAT SEEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISEASE.
MY INVESTIGATION OF 60 MINTS SUGGESTED THAT WILD OREGANO WAS AMONG THE
RICHEST IN ANTIOXIDANTS. SINCE IT'S A WEED AT MY PLACE, FRESH OREGANO IS A STANDARD INGREDIENT IN MY ANTIOXIDANTEA. YOU MIGHT TRY USING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS
OF DRIED OREGANO PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME ANTIOXIDANTEA, INCLUDE SOME PEPPERMINT OR ROSEMARY.
VV PANSY (VIOLA, VARIOUS SPECIES). PANSY CONTAINS A COMPOUND CALLED
RUTIN, WHICH NATUROPATHS OFTEN RECOMMEND FOR THE TREATMENT OF GLAUCOMA. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, WILD PANSY FLOWERS CAN CONTAIN UP TO 23 PERCENT RUTIN ON
A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD MEDICATIONS, RUTIN
SMOKE GELS IN YOUR EYES
PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE LEGALIZING MARIJUANA
FOR MEDICAL USES TYPICALLY MENTION IT AS A
TREATMENT FOR GLAUCOMA. THERE'S A GOOD
REASON FOR THIS. MARIJUANA (CANNABIS SALIVA)
APPARENTLY DOES LOWER THE PRESSURE OF FLUIDS
INSIDE THE EYE, OR INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE.
OF COURSE, MARIJUANA IS CURRENDY ILLEGAL, AND I WOULDN'T USE IT OR RECOMMEND
ITS USE ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
JUST HOW EFFECTIVE MARIJUANA MIGHT BE AS
A LONG-TERM TREATMENT FOR GLAUCOMA REMAINS A MYSTERY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO
LITDE RESEARCH ON IT.
PERHAPS FURTHER RESEARCH WILL BE
DONE, AND MARIJUANA WILL SOMEDAY BE
"PRESCRIBED" BY DOCTORS. IN FACT, GLAUCOMA
TREATMENT IS NOT THE ONLY POTENTIAL MEDICINAL USE OF THIS HERB. IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY
TO REDUCE SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CANCER
CHEMOTHERAPY, ESPECIALLY NAUSEA.
220
GLAUCOM A
CONTRIBUTES TO LOWERING THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE OF GLAUCOMA.
NATUROPATHS SUGGEST GETTING 20 MILLIGRAMS OF RUTIN THREE TIMES A DAY. I
ONCE CALCULATED THAT ONE EDIBLE PANSY FLOWER WOULD GIVE YOU ABOUT 20 MILLIGRAMS. IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE TO MUNCH ON A FEW PANSIES, AND THEY MAKE SPECTACULAR ADDITIONS TO SALADS.
RUTIN IS ALSO FOUND IN PAGODA TREE FLOWER, VIOLETS, EUCALYPTUS LEAF AND MULBERRY LEAF. IF I HAD GLAUCOMA, I'D SPRINKLE MY FRUIT COCKTAILS WITH VIOLETS. I
MIGHT ALSO WHIP UP SOME RUTINADE BY BLENDING A COUPLE OF VIOLETS AND A BIT OF
EUCALYPTUS LEAF INTO FRUIT JUICE.
V BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTILLUS). THIS BERRY HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED
TRADITIONALLY FOR ALMOST EVERY EYE AILMENT, AND GLAUCOMA IS NO EXCEPTION. IT TURNS
OUT THAT BILBERRIES CONTAIN COMPOUNDS CALLED ANTHOCYANOSIDES THAT RETARD THE
BREAKDOWN OF VITAMIN C. AS A RESULT, THEY HELP VITAMIN C DO ITS JOB OF PROTECTING
YOUR EYES.
JOSEPH PIZZORNO. N.D., PRESIDENT
OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, AND
MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHORS OF
A TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL MEDICINE, BOTH
RECOMMEND TAKING BILBERRY AND ITS
RELATIVE, BLUEBERRY, AS A PREVENTIVE
AND TREATMENT.
PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF JUICES SUGGEST
MIXING THE JUICES OF BILBERRY, BLUEBERRY, CRANBERRY AND HUCKLEBERRY,
ALL OF WHICH ARE HIGH IN ANTHOCYANOSIDES.
^ SHEPHERD'S PURSE (CAPSELLA BURSA-PASTORIS). THIS ANTIOXIDANT HERB HAS BEEN USED
TRADITIONALLY "TO BRIGHTEN VISION,"
ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT
LEUNG, PH.D. I SUGGEST ADDING A
LITTLE SHEPHERD'S PURSE TO YOUR FAVORITE HERBAL TEAS.
221
R 1WATCH THAF TOOTHPASTE
HERE'S AN HERB TO AVOID IF YOU HAVE GLAUCOMA OR A FAMILY HISTORY OF THE DISEASE.
•< THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE—NOT COMPELLING,
BUT WORTH NOTING—THAT CONSUMPTION OF
SANGUINARINE, A COMPOUND FOUND IN BLOODROOT (SANGUINARIA CANADENSIS) MAY CONTRIBUTE TO GLAUCOMA.
THE ONE PLACE YOU'RE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER BLOODROOT IS IN TOOTHPASTES OR
MOUTHWASHES, SINCE THE HERB IS AN EXCELLENT PREVENTIVE FOR GUM DISEASE. THE
PRODUCTS MIGHT HAVE THE COMPOUND SANGUINARINE RATHER THAN BLOODROOT ITSELF
LISTED ON THE LABEL.
I DON'T THINK THE RISK IS MAJOR; AFTER
ALL, YOU DON'T USUALLY INGEST EITHER TOOTHPASTE OR MOUTHWASH. BUT IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GLAUCOMA, YOU SHOULD BE
AWARE OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT BLOODROOT.
GOUT
I
HAVE GOUT. I FINALLY SUCCUMBED TO MY HMO DOCTOR'S PLEADING THAT I TAKE
ALLOPURINOL (LOPURIN, ZYLOPRIM). THAT WOULD BE ONE PIU A DAY FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE TO KEEP THIS CONDITION UNDER CONTROL.
FORTUNATELY, I'VE NOW FOUND AN HERBAL ALTERNATIVE IN CELERY SEED EXTRACT,
WHICH I EXPECT TO CONTINUE TAKING AS LONG AS THE THREAT OF GOUT HANGS OVER ME. I
KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT A GOUT ATTACK INVOLVES SUCH PAIN THAT I HOPE I NEVER
EXPERIENCE IT AGAIN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
MY FIRST GOUT ATTACK CAME WHEN I WAS JUST SHY OF AGE 50. ONE DAY I WAS OUT
WORKING IN THE GARDEN, ENJOYING ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTIVITIES. AND THE NEXT DAY,
OUT OF THE BLUE, I WOKE UP WITH CLASSIC GOUT PAIN AND SWELLING IN MY BIG TOE.
THE TOE WAS SO PAINFUL THAT, JUST AS THE BOOKS SAY, EVEN THE WEIGHT OF A BEDSHEET ON IT SEEMED UNBEARABLE. I COULD HARDLY WALK.
MY DOCTOR GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION DRUG THAT FLUSHES PAIN-CAUSING URIC ACID
CRYSTALS FROM THE BODY. I TOOK THE MEDICINE LIKE THE GOOD PATIENT THAT I AM
WHENEVER I'M FACED WITH PAIN. AND I QUICKLY WENT FROM BEING AN INVALID WHO
COULD BARELY WALK TO BEING BACK ON MY FEET AND PUTTERING IN MY HERB GARDEN
ONCE AGAIN.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT FOR THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, HOWEVER, I'M GLAD THAT I'VE
FOUND AN HERBAL REPLACEMENT THAT SEEMS TO DO THE TRICK.
CAUSED BY CRYSTALS
GOUT IS A FORM OF ARTHRITIS BECAUSE IT CAUSES PAIN IN THE JOINTS, USUALLY THE
BIG TOE, ALTHOUGH OTHER JOINTS CAN BE AFFECTED. IT'S CAUSED BY A BUILDUP OF URIC
ACID IN THE BLOOD. WHEN LEVELS RISE BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT, URIC ACID CRYSTALS
FORM AND COLLECT IN THE AFFECTED JOINT OR JOINTS, CAUSING EXCRUCIATING PAIN.
THESE CRYSTALS CAN ALSO FORM IN THE BODY'S MAJOR ORGANS AND DO CONSIDERABLE
DAMAGE, SO AVOIDING PAIN IS NOT THE ONLY REASON TO KEEP THIS SERIOUS CONDITION
UNDER CONTROL.
GOUT TENDS TO RUN IN FAMILIES. THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, IT WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH WEALTH, BECAUSE GOUT ATTACKS WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROVOKED BY EATING A RICH
DIET. NOW WE KNOW THAT THE DISEASE AFFLICTS RICH AND POOR ALIKE. MORE THAN 95
PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOUT ARE MEN OVER 30. AN ESTIMATED 10 TO 20 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS ELEVATED URIC ACID LEVELS, BUT ONLY 3 PEOPLE IN 1,000
EXPERIENCE GOUT.
222
GOU T
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GOUT
IF YOU HAVE GOUT, BY ALL MEANS TAKE THE MEDICATION THAT YOUR DOCTOR
PRESCRIBES. BUT IN ADDITION, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY SOME NATURAL APPROACHES TO
RELIEVING THIS PAINFUL AILMENT.
W%. CELERY (APIUTN GRAVEOLENS). LEARNING THAT CELERY EXTRACTS MIGHT HELP
ELIMINATE URIC ACID, I BEGAN TAKING TWO TO FOUR TABLETS OF CELERY SEED EXTRACTS DAILY
INSTEAD OF ALLOPURINOL. AS I WRITE, SIX MONTHS HAVE GONE BY WITHOUT A SINGLE GOUT
CRISIS. FOR ONE WEEK, I ATE FOUR CELERY STALKS A DAY IN LIEU OF THE EXTRACTS.
THESE SELF-DOSING ANECDOTAL RESULTS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THE ADVERTISEMENT
THAT LED ME TO THE CELERY SEED. A SKEPTIC THEN, I'M A BELIEVER NOW: CELERY SEED
(OR SERENDIPITY) HAS KEPT MY URIC ACID BELOW CRITICAL LEVELS.
VV CLIISO (PERILLA FRUTESCENS). THIS AROMATIC, WEEDY MINT, IMPORTED ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENTIONALLY FROM ASIA DECADES AGO, IS A POPULAR FOOD AND MEDICINE
IN THE ORIENT. HERE IT'S A RAMPANT WEED, BUT YOU'LL FIND IT GROWN INTENTIONALLY BEHIND SOME JAPANESE RESTAURANTS IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.
JAPANESE RESEARCHERS HAVE TOUTED COMPOUNDS IN CHISO TO RELIEVE GOUT. IT
CONTAINS FAIRLY HIGH LEVELS OF FOUR COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS XANTHINE OXIDASE (XO)
INHIBITORS, WHICH HELP PREVENT THE SYNTHESIS OF URIC ACID. I FREQUENTLY ADD A
LITDE CHISO TO MY MINT TEAS, JUST AS THE JAPANESE ADD IT TO THEIR SUSHI.
V * LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA).
LIKE CHISO, LICORICE CONTAINS SEVERAL XO
INHIBITORS, BUT AT FAIRLY LOW LEVELS. STILL, A
CHISO-LICORICE COMBO COULD BE INTERESTING,
AND THE TWO HERBS MIGHT EVEN WORK BETTER
TOGETHER.
V*. TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA).
ONE COMPOUND IN TURMERIC (CURCUMIN) INHIBITS THE SYNTHESIS OF SUBSTANCES CALLED
PROSTAGLANDINS IN THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PAIN. THE MECHANISM IS SIMILAR
TO THE ONE INVOLVED IN THE PAIN-RELIEVING
ACTION OF ASPIRIN AND IBUPROFEN, ONLY
WEAKER. STILL, AT HIGH DOSES, CURCUMIN STIMULATES THE ADRENAL GLANDS TO RELEASE THE
BODY'S OWN CORTISONE, A POTENT RELIEVER OF
INFLAMMATION AND THE PAIN IT OFTEN CAUSES.
EAST INDIANS REVERE TURMERIC AND USE IT
TURMERIC
A SPICE RELATED TO GINGER, THIS
HERB IS NATIVE TO INDIA AND
SOUTHEAST ASIA.
LIBERALLY IN CURRIES. THAT'S A PARTICULARLY NICE WAY TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE, IF YOU
ASK ME. YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A TEA USING TURMERIC OR SIMPLY TAKE IT IN CAPSULES.
223
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
^ AVOCADO (PERSEA AMERICANA). MY BOTANICAL FRIENDS IN THE AMAZON
BELIEVE THAT AVOCADO IS USEFUL FOR TREATING GOUT. IT REPORTEDLY LOWERS URIC ACID
LEVELS IN THE BLOOD.
THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT I'M AWARE OF TO SUPPORT THIS ASSERTION, BUT
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE HERBAL WISDOM OF THE AMAZONIAN PEOPLE, AND AVOCADOS ARE CERTAINLY TASTY. SO HERE'S A GOOD REASON TO ADD AN OCCASIONAL AVOCADO TO
YOUR DIET. JUST DON'T GO OVERBOARD, THOUGH, AS AVOCADOS ARE HIGH IN CALORIES.
V CAT'S CLAW (UNCARIA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). ONCE WHILE I WAS ON THE
AMAZON, AN ATTACK OF GOUT CAUGHT ME WITHOUT THE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION I USUALLY TAKE TO ALLEVIATE THE INFLAMMATION DURING A CRISIS. BUT I HAD SOME PILLS CONTAINING CAT'S CLAW (UNA DE GATO\ AN HERB WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS.
I TOOK TWO PILLS. NO RELIEF. I TRIED FOUR. NOTHING. THEN, AT SIX, I BEGAN TO NOTICE SOME EFFECT, BUT IT TOOK NEARLY A DOZEN TO DO AS MUCH AS THE DRUG. WHILE
I'M CERTAINLY NOT DISCARDING MY PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS IN FAVOR OF CAT'S CLAW,
IN AN EMERGENCY I'D USE THE HERB AGAIN.
THERE ARE MORE THAN 30 BRANDS OF CAT'S CLAW ON SALE IN HEALTH FOOD STORES
AND HERB SHOPS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REPORT IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE OF AN ADVERSE REACTION EVER DEVELOPING IN ANYONE USING THE HERB.
V CHERRY (PRUNUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). MANY PEOPLE CLAIM TO STAVE OFF
GOUT ATTACKS BY EATING EIGHT OUNCES A DAY OF CANNED OR FRESH CHERRIES. I HAVE
ONE FRIEND, FOR INSTANCE, WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE GREAT LUCK IN STAVING OFF GOUT WHEN
HE EATS BLACK CHERRIES. THIS THERAPY HAS NEVER BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRATED
TO WORK, BUT SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE SWEAR BY IT, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH
TRYING. (ONE CAVEAT, THOUGH: BUYING THIS MANY CHERRIES MIGHT BE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY ALLOPURINOL.) OTHER PEOPLE FAVOR STRAWBERRIES.
I'M GOING TO GIVE MY CHERRY COCKTAIL A TRY. IT'S A MIXTURE OF CHERRY,
PINEAPPLE, STRAWBERRY AND BLUEBERRY JUICES SPICED UP WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
LICORICE AND A LOT OF GINGER AND TURMERIC.
V DEVIL'S CLAW (HARPAGOPHYTUM PROCUMBENS). SEVERAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THIS HERB LOWERS URIC ACID LEVELS AND HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION, BOTH
OF WHICH WOULD BE USEFUL FOR TREATING GOUT. OTHER STUDIES SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE
USEFUL FOR RELIEVING ARTHRITIC CONDITIONS, AND GOUT IS A FORM OF ARTHRITIS.
UNFORTUNATELY, STUDIES RELY ON INJECTIONS OF AN HERBAL EXTRACT OF DEVIL'S CLAW,
AND AN INJECTION GOES RIGHT INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WITHOUT PASSING THROUGH THE
STOMACH. THIS HERB LOSES POTENCY IN THE STOMACH, SO I CAN'T GUESS HOW EFFECTIVE
(OR INEFFECTIVE) IT MIGHT BE IN A TEA OR CAPSULE. I THINK IT'S WORTH TRYING, HOWEVER.
V OAT (ARENA SATIVA). TEAS MADE FROM THE SILICA-RICH GREEN TOPS OF THE
OAT PLANT ARE SAID TO HAVE A DIURETIC EFFECT THAT LOWERS BLOOD LEVELS OF URIC ACID. (A
DIURETIC IS ANY SUBSTANCE THAT FLUSHES EXCESS WATER FROM THE BODY.) IF MY OTHER NAT224
GRAVES ' DISEASE
URAL APPROACHES FAILED, I'D BE SURE TO TRY THIS ONE.
V OLIVE (OLEA EUROPEA). OLIVE HAS A REPUTATION AS A DIURETIC DATING BACK
TO BIBLICAL TIMES. IN 1993, A JAPANESE RESEARCHER SHOWED THAT ABOUT FOUR CUPS OF
OLIVE LEAF TEA A DAY FOR THREE WEEKS INCREASED DAILY URINE OUTPUT BY 10 TO 15 PERCENT, LOWERING URIC ACID LEVELS IN THE BLOOD AND INCREASING URIC ACID IN THE URINE.
I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO TRY THIS ONE MYSELF.
V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). PINEAPPLE CONTAINS BROMELAIN, AN ENZYME THAT HELPS BREAK DOWN PROTEIN. NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS OFTEN RECOMMEND
PURE BROMELAIN, WHICH CAN BE PURCHASED AT HEALTH FOOD STORES, TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND SWELLING.
BROMELAIN CLEARLY WORKS IF YOU INJECT IT INTO SWOLLEN TISSUE, BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INGESTED ENZYME HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH
TRYING, HOWEVER. MY PREFERRED WAY TO GET BROMELAIN IS IN AN OCCASIONAL GLASS OF
PINEAPPLE JUICE.
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). ONE SCIENTIFIC STUDY SHOWED THAT
STINGING NETTLE INCREASES URIC ACID SECRETION, AT LEAST IN DUCKS. THESE EXPERIMENTAL
ANIMALS EXHIBITED LOWER BLOOD LEVELS OF URIC ACID AFTER THEY WERE GIVEN STINGING
NETTLE EXTRACT. THE NEXT TIME I HAVE PAIN IN MY BIG TOE, I INTEND TO INCLUDE STINGING
NETTLE TEA IN MY OWN TREATMENT PROGRAM.
V WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK IS EQUIVALENT TO HERBAL ASPIRIN, AS IT CONTAINS COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SALICYLATES, FROM WHICH ASPIRIN IS MADE.
LIKE ASPIRIN, WILLOW BARK TEA CAN HELP RELIEVE PAIN AND INFLAMMATION. IN
ADDITION, SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SALICYLATES CAN REDUCE LEVELS OF URIC ACID.
TRY TWO TEASPOONS OF BARK IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER AND SIMMER FOR 20 MINUTES.
(IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, HOWEVER, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE
HERBS, EITHER.)
RAVES DISEASE
(HYPERTHYROIDISM)
P
ERHAPS WE SHOULD START REFERRING TO GRAVES' DISEASE AS BUSH DISEASE.
BOTH FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS WIFE, BARBARA, HAD IT DURING HIS
TERM OF OFFICE. THEIR CONDITION WAS REVEALED IN 1991, AND THEY CONTROLLED IT WITH
MEDICATION.
G
225
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SHORTLY AFTER THE BUSHES' THYROID CONDITION BECAME KNOWN, A YOUNG LADY
TOLD ME THAT HER GRAVES' DISEASE MEDICATION WAS CAUSING HER SOME TROUBLESOME
SIDE EFFECTS, AND SHE WANTED TO STOP TAKING IT. SHE ASKED ME TO CHECK MY DATABASE AND OTHER SOURCES FOR HERBAL ALTERNATIVES.
I WARNED HER THAT HER CONDITION WAS NOTHING TO TOY WITH. LIKE ALL HORMONAL
IMBALANCES, GRAVES' DISEASE IS A COMPLEX CONDITION THAT'S NOT GENERALLY
AMENABLE TO SELF-TREATMENT WITH NONSTANDARDIZED MEDICATIONS, AND HERBS GENERALLY FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. SHE COUNTERED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO STOP TAKING
HER DRUGS NO MATTER WHAT I SAID, SO I FIGURED THE LEAST I COULD DO WAS SEE IF ANY
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES MIGHT HELP HER.
DELVING INTO THE LITERATURE, I CAME UP WITH BUGLEWEED AS ONE OF THE MOST
PROMISING ALTERNATIVES. MONTHS LATER, THE YOUNG WOMAN TOLD ME THAT SHE'D QUIT
HER MEDICATION AND HAD BEEN DRINKING MINT TEAS CONTAINING PLENTY OF BUGLEWEED. AFTER SHE'D BEEN OFF HER MEDICATION FOR A MONTH, SHE DROPPED BY MY OFFICE, BEAMING. SHE'D JUST HAD A CHECKUP, AND HER BLOOD LEVEL OF
THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), ONE OF THE THINGS THAT GOES OFF-KILTER IN
GRAVES' DISEASE, WAS FINE. THE SAME WAS TRUE A MONTH LATER.
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WOMAN GOT BETTER. MAYBE IT WAS THE BUGLEWEED THAT DID THE TRICK, BUT I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE WITH
GRAVES' DISEASE TOSS THEIR MEDICATION AND START DRINKING BUGLEWEED TEA.
NOT BEING A MEDICAL DOCTOR, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THAT MUCH ABOUT HORMONAL DISORDERS. IF YOU HAVE GRAVES' DISEASE, FD SAY THAT YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR
DOCTOR, NOT A BOTANIST OR HERBALIST, AND DO FOLLOW YOUR DOCTOR'S ADVICE. BUT IN
THIS CASE, A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING GRAVES' DISEASE UNDER
CONTROL, AND WE HAVE HER CHARTS TO VERIFY HER IMPROVEMENT.
TNYROIA SET ON HIGFN
WITH HYPERTHYROIDISM, THERE ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS OF THYROID
HORMONES CIRCULATING IN THE BODY. THESE HORMONES ARE SECRETED BY THE THYROID
GLAND, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE NECK JUST BEHIND AND BELOW THE ADAM'S APPLE.
THE DISEASE WAS NAMED AFTER AN IRISH PHYSICIAN, ROBERT JAMES GRAVES, WHO
LIVED IN THE EARLY 1800S AND WAS THE FIRST TO IDENTIFY ITS TELLTALE PATTERN OF SYMPTOMS: ENLARGED THYROID GLAND, BULGING EYES, RAPID PULSE, PROFUSE SWEATING, FATIGUE, AN INCREASED METABOLIC RATE LEADING TO SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT LOSS AND
NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS RESTLESSNESS, IRRITABILITY AND FINE MUSCLE
TREMORS.
LEVELS OF CIRCULATING THYROID HORMONES DEPEND ON SEVERAL THINGS: AVAILABILITY OF THE MINERAL IODINE, LEVELS OF TSH RELEASED BY THE PITUITARY GLAND (LO226
GRAVES' DISEASE
CATED IN THE CENTER OF THE BRAIN) AND THE HEALTH OF THE THYROID GLAND ITSELF. TSH
LEVELS ARE FURTHER REGULATED BY YET ANOTHER PART OF THE BRAIN, THE HYPOTHALAMUS.
ALL OF THIS TRANSLATES INTO A SIMPLE FORMULA IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL: AS TSH
LEVELS INCREASE, THE LEVELS OF THYROID HORMONE ALSO INCREASE, UNTIL A BALANCE IS
REACHED. IF THE THYROID-IS MALFUNCTIONING, ITS ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE HORMONE
LEVELS WILL THROW THE SYSTEM FURTHER OUT OF WHACK.
THYROID DISEASES AFFECT ABOUT 2.5 PERCENT OF AMERICANS, OR SOME 6.5 MILLION
PEOPLE, MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF THYROID HORMONE IMBALANCE, HYPERTHYROIDISM (HYPER- MEANS "TOO MUCH") AND HYPOTHYROIDISM (HYPOMEANS "TOO LITTLE"). IN THIS CHAPTER, I DEAL WITH TOO MUCH THYROID HORMONE; FOR MORE ON HYPOTHYROIDISM, SEE PAGE 272.
WOMEN ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO HAVE GRAVES' DISEASE. (THEY
ARE ALSO TWICE AS LIKELY AS MEN TO DEVELOP THYROID TUMORS.) THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF HYPERTHYROIDISM, BUT GRAVES' DISEASE IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON.
IT'S AN AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION, MEANING THAT IT'S THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKING THE BODY, AND IT AFFECTS ABOUT ONE MILLION AMERICANS.
DOCTORS TREAT GRAVES' DISEASE BY TRYING TO SUPPRESS THYROID HORMONE PRODUCTION. ANY OF SEVERAL DRUGS MAY BE PRESCRIBED, AND SOMETIMES, USUALLY IN
DRUG-SENSITIVE ELDERLY PEOPLE, RADIATION MAY BE USED TO DISABLE A PORTION OF THE
THYROID GLAND ITSELF.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR GRAVES'DISEASE
IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF GRAVES' DISEASE, SEE A DOCTOR AND TAKE THE PRESCRIBED MEDICATION. DO NOT ATTEMPT SELF-TREATMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT WORKED FOR
THE YOUNG WOMAN WHOSE STORY BEGAN THIS CHAPTER. IN ADDITION TO FOLLOWING YOUR
DOCTOR'S ADVICE, AND WITH HIS PERMISSION, YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY THESE HERBS.
V W BUGLEWEED (LYEOPUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). BUGLEWEED HAS A CONSIDERABLE FOLK HISTORY FOR TREATING THYROID CONDITIONS, AND MODERN RESEARCH SUPPORTS THIS USE. THIS HERB INHIBITS IODINE METABOLISM AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT
OF HORMONE THAT'S PRODUCED BY THYROID CELLS.
LEAF EXTRACTS ARE MORE ACTIVE THAN ROOT EXTRACTS. THE RECOMMENDED ORAL
PREPARATION IS A TINCTURE (ALCOHOL EXTRACT) RATHER THAN A TEA. IN ONE STUDY USING
LABORATORY ANIMALS, BUGLEWEED TINCTURE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN
THYROID HORMONE LEVELS.
BUGLEWEED IS WIDELY USED IN EUROPE AS AN HERBAL TREATMENT FOR EARLY-STAGE
GRAVES' DISEASE, OFTEN IN COMBINATION WITH LEMON BALM. HOWEVER, I MUST CAUTION THAT BUGLEWEED—AND OTHER HERBAL TREATMENTS FOR GRAVES' DISEASE—HAVE
MILD EFFECTS AND ARE BEST USED IN EARLY STAGES OF THE CONDITION OR IN ADDITION TO
SYNTHETIC PHARMACEUTICALS.
227
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TO MAKE A TASTY MIXED HERB TEA THAT COMBATS GRAVES* DISEASE, COMBINE TWO TEASPOONS OF LEMON BALM WITH ONE TEASPOON
OF BUGLEWEED AND THEN ADD MINT, ROSEMARY, SELF-HEAL AND VERBENA TO TASTE. I
THINK DRINKING THIS TEA REGULARLY JUST
MIGHT HELP.
W V LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS)* IN EUROPE, LEMON BALM, ALSO
KNOWN AS MELISSA, IS OFTEN RECOMMENDED ALONG WITH BUGLEWEED FOR
TREATING GRAVES* DISEASE. STUDIES SHOW
THAT LEMON BALM CAUSES A DECREASE IN
BLOOD AND PITUITARY LEVELS OF TSH AFTER
A SINGLE INJECTION, THUS REDUCING THYROID
HORMONE PRODUCTION. IT'S NOT CLEAR IF
LEMON BALM HAS A SIMILAR EFFECT WHEN
IWWWMUMUTM, TAKEN ORALLY> BUT L ^ ^
 THE CHANCES
ARE GOOD. IT'S PROBABLY WORTH A TRY.
V W SELF-HEAL (PRUNELLA VULGARIS). A QUARTER-POUND SERVING OF SELF-HEAL
GREENS WITH BUGLEWEED TUBERS, SPICED UP WITH BASIL, OREGANO, ROSEMARY AND
SPEARMINT, SHOULD CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF THE COMPOUND ROSMARINIC ACID,
WHICH HELPS SUPPRESS THYROID HORMONE PRODUCTION.
W KELP (LAMINARIA, VARIOUS SPECIES). HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL
MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL
TONIC THERAPIES, NOTES THAT AMONG THE JAPANESE WHO CONSUME A GREAT DEAL OF KELP,
THYROID DISEASE IS PRACTICALLY UNKNOWN, BUT AMONG THE JAPANESE WHO HAVE BECOME WESTERNIZED AND EAT LITTLE OR NO KELP, THYROID DISEASE IS ON THE RISE.
YOU CAN BUY POWDERED KELP IN HEALTH FOOD STORES TO SPRINKLE ON YOUR FOOD
AS A SEASONING.
W VERBENA (VERBENA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). OFTEN CALLED VERVAIN, VERBENA
SEEMS TO HAVE PROPERTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF SELF-HEAL. EXTRACTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO
SUPPRESS THYROID HORMONE PRODUCTION BY INFLUENCING LEVELS OF TSH IN THE BODY.
V BROCCOLI (BRASSICA OLERACEA). REMEMBER HOW GEORGE BUSH HATED
BROCCOLI? HIS AVERSION TO THAT WONDERFUL VEGETABLE DEPRIVED HIM OF SOMETHING
" THAT MIGHT HAVE HELPED TREAT HIS GRAVES' DISEASE. BROCCOLI CONTAINS NATURALLY
OCCURRING SUBSTANCES CALLED ISOTHIOCYANATES, WHICH HELP RESTRAIN THE THYROID
FROM PRODUCING TOO MUCH HORMONE. WHEN BUSH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH GRAVES*
DISEASE, SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE HEALTH AUTHORITIES URGED HIM TO EAT BROCCOLI. ONE
EVEN PUBLISHED A BOOK TITLED WHY GEORGE SHOULD EAT BROCCOLI.
V RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVUS). ALL OF THE CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES GENTLY
AND NATURALLY SUPPRESS THYROID HORMONE PRODUCTION, BUT RADISHES DO IT BEST, ACCORDING TO MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMANLS
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS. CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES INCLUDE
BROCCOLI, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER, KALE, MUSTARD GREENS, RADISHES,
RUTABAGAS AND TURNIPS. RADISHES ARE USED IN RUSSIA PRECISELY FOR THIS PURPOSE.
228
HANGOVER
I
'M WHAT I CALL AN ANTISOCIAL DRINKER. I DON'T FEEL ALL THAT COMFORTABLE ENGAGING IN SMALL TALK, SO I PUT A GLASS TO MY MOUTH, AND OCCASIONALLY I
DRINK TOO MUCH. I DEFINE "TOO MUCH" AS ANY AMOUNT THAT GIVES ME THE
HEADACHE, STOMACH UPSET, THIRST AND GENERAL DEATH-WARMED-OVER FEELING OF A
HANGOVER. CONSERVATIVELY, ANY MORE THAN TWO DRINKS A DAY IS TOO MUCH.
MAYBE YOU'VE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE. BUT IF YOU HAVE, YOU MAY
HAVE OCCASION TO USE SOME NATURAL HANGOVER REMEDIES.
HANGOVER IS UNFORTUNATELY QUITE COMMON, BECAUSE ALCOHOLISM IS A MAJOR
PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM, AFFECTING SOME TEN MILLION AMERICANS. BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ABUSE ALCOHOL TO SUFFER AN OCCASIONAL HANGOVER. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
GET TERRIBLY DRUNK.
WHY HANGOVERS HURT SO MUCN
HANGOVER IS A MILD VERSION OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME, WHICH CAUSES
DELIRIUM TREMENS (DTS) IN ALCOHOLICS. THE HEADACHE IS PROMPTED IN PART BY ALCOHOL'S RELAXING EFFECT ON THE BLOOD VESSELS. AS THEY OPEN UP, MORE BLOOD FLOWS
THROUGH THEM, WHICH CAUSES THE SENSATION OF WARMTH WE FEEL WHEN DRINKING.
BUT IF THE BLOOD VESSELS OF THE HEAD OPEN TOO MUCH, THEY TRIGGER THE PAIN
NERVES.
ALCOHOL IS ALSO A DIURETIC, SO FLUID LOSS CONTRIBUTES TO MORNING-AFTER THIRST
AND CAN ADD TO HEAD PAIN.
THE NAUSEA AND VOMITING ARE A COMBINATION OF ALCOHOL'S IRRITATING EFFECT ON
THE STOMACH AND ITS MANY EFFECTS ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.
THE FATIGUE AND GENERAL LOUSY-ALL-OVER FEELING RESULT FROM ALCOHOL'S DEPRESSANT EFFECT AND A BUILDUP OF ACIDS IN THE BLOOD (ACIDOSIS). THE CHEMICAL
ACETALDEHYDE MAY ALSO ACCUMULATE IN THE BLOOD, LEADING TO FLUSHING.
FINALLY, ADDITIVES AND IMPURITIES IN ALCOHOL (CONGENERS) CONTRIBUTE TO
HANGOVERS. THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT THE DARKER THE ALCOHOL, THE WORSE THE HANGOVER. VODKA AND WHITE WINE CONTAIN FEW CONGENERS, BUT BOURBON, SCOTCH AND
RED WINE ARE LOADED WITH THEM.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HANGOVER
I HATE TO STATE THE OBVIOUS, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SAID THAT A GOOD BASIC APPROACH TO HANGOVER IS TO PREVENT IT BY NOT DRINKING IN THE FIRST PLACE. OR YOU
229
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEA L
MIGHT TRY DRINKING CLEAR LIQUOR OR WHITE WINE RATHER THAN THE DARK STUFF. IT ALSO
HELPS TO DRINK LOTS OF NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES TO STAY WELL-HYDRATED AND WASH
THE ACIDS OUT OF YOUR BLOOD. ALL THIS HELPS HEAD OFF BOTH THE HEADACHE AND THE
UPSET STOMACH.
IN ADDITION, TRY THESE NATURAL HANGOVER AIDS.
V CINCHONA (CINCHONA, VARIOUS SPECIES.) THE BITTER BARK THAT GIVES
TONIC WATER ITS FLAVOR AND IS THE SOURCE OF QUININE IS USED AS A HANGOVER REMEDY
IN CHINA. WATER IN AND OF ITSELF HELPS, BUT I SUSPECT THAT BITTER HERBS LIKE CINCHONA
PROVIDE ADDED BENEFIT. OTHER BITTER HERBS OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR HANGOVER INCLUDE DANDELION, GENTIAN, MUGWORT AND ANGOSTURA, WHICH IS THE SAME HERB USED
IN ANGOSTURA BITTERS, A FAVORITE HANGOVER REMEDY AMONG BARTENDERS.
YOU CAN MAKE AN ANTI-HANGOVER TEA BY ADDING A FEW DROPS OF ANGOSTURA
BITTERS TO A CUP OF BOILING WATER. IN FACT, ANY OF THESE HERBS CAN BE MADE INTO A
VERY BITTER TEA. I'D SUGGEST CUTTING THE BITTER FLAVOR BY ADDING THE TASTY HERBS
ROSELLE AND TAMARIND, BOTH OF WHICH ARE ALSO REPUTED TO HELP BANISH HANGOVER.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO SEEDS ARE NOT APPROVED AS FOOD BY
THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, BUT THEY ARE AVAILABLE HERE. THE JAPANESE
HAVE LONG SERVED GINKGO SEEDS AT COCKTAIL PARTIES, BASED ON FOLKLORE ASSERTIONS
THAT THEY PREVENT DRUNKENNESS AND HANGOVER. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OUT OF JAPAN HAVE
SHOWN THAT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT GINKGO SEEDS REALLY CAN GET THE JOB
DONE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SEEDS CONTAIN AN ENZYME THAT SPEEDS UP THE BODY'S METABOLISM OF ALCOHOL.
IN ONE STUDY, THE RESEARCHERS GAVE LABORATORY ANIMALS ENOUGH ALCOHOL TO
GET THEM VERY DRUNK. WHEN THE ANIMALS WERE GIVEN GINKGO SEED EXTRACTS IN ADVANCE, THEY WERE BETTER ABLE TO CLEAR ALCOHOL FROM THEIR BLOOD. FM NOT SURE THAT
GINKGO SEEDS HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT IN HUMANS, BUT I SUSPECT THEY DO, WHICH
CALLS FOR A LITTLE POEM: 'THEY SAY THAT YOU WON'T GET REAL STINKO/IF YOU NIBBLE
THE NUTS OF THE GINKGO."
NOT GREAT POETRY, I ADMIT, BUT IT WILL HELP YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU NEED TO
CURE THE DAY-AFTER BLUES.
V KUDZU (PUERARIA LOBATA). SOME SCIENTISTS FINGER A SPECIFIC CHEMICAL
(ACETALDEHYDE) AS THE BIG CULPRIT IN HANGOVER. KUDZU CAN CAUSE ACETALDEHYDE TO
ACCUMULATE IN YOUR BLOOD FASTER, SO YOU GET YOUR HANGOVER—LITERALLY FEELING
HEADACHY AND NAUSEATED—WHILE YOU'RE DRINKING INSTEAD OF THE MORNING AFTER. THE
TRICK IS TO TAKE ONE OR TWO CAPSULES OF DRIED KUDZU WITH YOUR FIRST DRINK.
THE ADVANTAGE HERE, OF COURSE, IS THAT AS YOU START FEELING LOUSY, YOU'LL CUT
BACK ON YOUR DRINKING. ACETALDEHYDE ACCUMULATION MAKES DRINKING LESS
PLEASANT AND HELPS KEEP YOU FROM IMBIBING TO EXCESS. THE CHINESE USE KUDZU
ROOTS OR FLOWERS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
230
HANGOVER
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE KUDZU AS A
TEA THE MORNING AFTER, AND EXPERTS SAY
IT CAN HELP PROVIDE SOME RELIEF.
AT THIS POINT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE
IN THE SOUTH, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING IF I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT OBNOXIOUS VINE THAT MANAGES TO DRAPE ITSELF
OVER FIELDS AND FORESTS FOR MILES ON END.
INDEED I AM. THERE IS A VALID USE FOR
THIS CREEPING GREEN MONSTER, AFTER ALL!
V WINTERGREEN (CAULTHERIA
PROCUMBENS) AND WILLOW (SALIX,
VARIOUS SPECIES). I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND TAKING ASPIRIN FOR A HANGOVER, AS IT
MIGHT AGGRAVATE YOUR UPSET STOMACH.
BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND HERBAL FORMS OF
ASPIRIN GENDER ON THE STOMACH, WHICH IS
WHY I CAN RECOMMEND THE ATTRACTIVE,
AROMATIC WINTERGREEN. IT'S LOADED WITH AN
ASPIRIN RELATIVE, METHYL-SALICYLATE, SO IT
COULD HELP CLEAR UP A HANGOVER
HEADACHE. (IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN,
HOWEVER, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO AVOID ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS AS WELL.)
IF YOU LIKE, YOU MIGHT MIX WINTERGREEN WITH WILLOW BARK, WHICH ALSO CONTAINS SALICYLATES. BOTH ARE AVAILABLE ALL YEAR LONG WHERE I LIVE, AND AS FAR NORTH
AS MAINE. (OF COURSE, IF YOU CAN'T PICK 'EM FRESH, YOU CAN ALWAYS BUY THESE
HERBS IN DRIED FORM.)
CHERRY BIRCH BARK CAN ALSO BE USED AS A SOURCE OF SALICYLATES. I'D MAKE A
CHERRY BIRCH BARK TEA AND ADD AS MUCH HOT-PEPPER SAUCE AS MY TASTE BUDS CAN
BEAR. HOT-PEPPER SAUCE CONTAINS CAPSAICIN, A SUPERB PAINKILLER.
OR I'D TRY THIS ASPIRIN-REPLACEMENT HERBAL BLEND FROM CHRISTOPHER HOBBS,
DISTINGUISHED FOURTH-GENERATION CALIFORNIA HERBALIST AND BOTANIST AND AUTHOR OF
HANDBOOK FOR HERBAL HEALING: TWO PARTS EACH OF PASSIONFLOWER, WHITE WILLOW AND
WOOD BETONY AND ONE PART LAVENDER. HOBBS SUGGESTS STEEPING TWO TEASPOONS OF
THE MIXTURE IN ONE CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V FOLK HERBS. MANY HERBS HAVE BEEN USED FOLKLORICALLY FOR HANGOVER. THEY
MIGHT HELP, OR PERHAPS IT'S SIMPLY THE WATER IN THE TEA THAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL
BETTER. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MEDICAL FOLKLORE, SO I'LL SHARE THE HERBS WITH YOU:
BASIL, BLACK PEPPER, CARAWAY, CINNAMON, CORIANDER, FORSYTHIA, GINGER, GOTU KOLA,
KUDZU
A NOTORIOUS VINE THAT SOMETIMES COMPLETELY SMOTHERS SOUTHERN PINE TREES,
KUDZU CAN BE BOUGHT IN MEDICINAL
CAPSULES.
231
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HONEYSUCKLE, LAVENDER, LEMONGRASS, ONION, PENNYROYAL, PEPPERMINT, PLANTAIN,
POPPY SEEDS, ROSEMARY, RUE, TEA AND YARROW. THE MINTS CONTAIN POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS, SUBSTANCES THAT CAN HELP PREVENT SOME OF THE CELLULAR-LEVEL DAMAGE THAT ALCOHOL CAUSES.
GUATEMALANS USE JUICES OR TEAS OF RED ROSELLE, WHILE LATIN AMERICANS GENERALLY RECOMMEND A BEVERAGE MADE OF THE PULP OF TAMARIND. BOTH OF THESE ARE
FAVORITES OF MINE. WE COULD MIX THEM TOGETHER, SWEETEN THEM WITH HIGH-FRUCTOSE HONEY, AND CALL IT THE RED HANGOVER ZAPPER.
MY OWN FAVORITE REMEDY IS VEGETABLE JUICE COCKTAIL WITH A BIT OF HOT-PEPPER
SAUCE. ALL THOSE VEGGIES THAT ARE USED TO MAKE THE JUICE CONTAIN ANTIOXIDANTS,
AND OF COURSE, HOT-PEPPER SAUCE CONTAINS THE PAINKILLER CAPSAICIN. I ALSO LIKE
ONION SOUP, ANOTHER FOLK REMEDY FOR HANGOVER AND A SURPRISINGLY GOOD SOURCE OF
FRUCTOSE.
V FRUCTOSE. FRUCTOSE IS FRUIT SUGAR. KOREAN SCIENTISTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT
FRUCTOSE CAN SPEED UP THE BODY'S METABOLISM OF ALCOHOL BY ABOUT 25 PERCENT.
GINSENG ROOT IS A FAVORITE HERB IN KOREA, AND GINSENG CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 0.5 PERCENT FRUCTOSE. PERHAPS THAT'S WHY BOTH ASIAN (PANAX GINSENG)
AND AMERICAN (P. QUINQUEFOLIUS) GINSENG HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USE FOR TREATING
HANGOVER. PERSONALLY, I RARELY RECOMMEND GINSENG BECAUSE IT COSTS SO MUCH.
FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE CHEAPER AND MUCH BETTER SOURCES OF FRUCTOSE. TRY
PUTTING SOME HONEY IN YOUR MORNING TEA; IT'S MORE THAN 40 PERCENT FRUCTOSE.
MAYBE THAT'S WHY ONE OLD-TIME HANGOVER REMEDY AMONG BARTENDERS IS SIMPLY
HONEY IN HOT WATER.
NOT FAR BEHIND HONEY ARE DATES, WITH 30 PERCENT FRUCTOSE. IF YOU DON'T WANT
TEA IN THE MORNING, SEE IF YOU CAN FORCE DOWN A COUPLE OF DATES.
HEADACHE
E
VERYONE GETS A HEADACHE NOW AND THEN, BUT AN ESTIMATED 15 PERCENT
OF THE POPULATION—SOME 40 MILLION AMERICANS—HAVE AT LEAST ONE A
WEEK. THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN OUT THERE.
AN ESTIMATED 90 PERCENT OF HEADACHES ARE TENSION HEADACHES, WHICH BEGIN
IN THE BACK OF THE NECK OR HEAD AND SPREAD OUTWARD WITH A DULL, NONTHROBBING
PAIN.
THE OTHER 10 PERCENT, INCLUDING MIGRAINES, CLUSTER HEADACHES AND CAFFEINE-WITHDRAWAL HEADACHES, ARE CAUSED BY THE OPENING AND CLOSING (DILATION
232
HEADACH E
AND CONSTRICTION) OF BLOOD VESSELS IN THE HEAD THAT SET OFF PAIN NERVES. CLASSIC
MIGRAINE IS A SEVERE AND THROBBING HEADACHE, USUALLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD
AND OFTEN PRECEDED BY VISUAL DISTURBANCES. NAUSEA AND VOMITING OFTEN ACCOMPANY THE MIGRAINE.
MIGRAINE HEADACHES INFLICT MISERY ON 25 MILLION AMERICANS. FOR UNKNOWN
REASONS, ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MANY WOMEN AS MEN EXPERIENCE THIS PAINFUL CONDITION. WOMEN OFTEN DEVELOP MIGRAINES JUST PRIOR TO MENSTRUAL PERIODS OR
DURING PREGNANCY, AND THE MIGRAINES DISAPPEAR AFTER MENOPAUSE IN ABOUT
THREE-QUARTERS OF WOMEN.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HEADACHE
NO SINGLE NATURAL THERAPY—OR PHARMACEUTICAL, FOR THAT MATTER—WORKS FOR
EVERY TYPE OF HEADACHE. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SEVERAL HERBS THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE THE DIFFERENT TYPES.
V W BAY (LAURUS NOBILIS). BAY CONTAINS COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS PARTHENOLIDES THAT ARE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN PREVENTING MIGRAINE. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM
OF THESE HEADACHES IS NOT THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD, IT APPEARS THAT RELEASE OF THE
NEUROTRANSMITTER SEROTONIN FROM BLOOD CELLS KNOWN AS PLATELETS PLAYS A CAUSATIVE
ROLE. PARTHENOLIDES INHIBIT SEROTONIN RELEASE FROM PLATELETS.
IF I HAD FREQUENT MIGRAINES, I MIGHT ADD BAY LEAVES TO FEVERFEW, MY TOPCHOICE HERB FOR TREATING THIS CONDITION.
W * FEVERFEW {TANACETUM PARTHENIUM). IT'S BEEN MORE THAN TEN YEARS
NOW SINCE FEVERFEW HELPED MY SISTER-IN-LAW BEAT HER MIGRAINES. THIS HERB ALSO
HELPED MY SECRETARY'S SISTER. I CONSIDER FEVERFEW ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING HERBS
IN MODERN HERBALISM.
IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE, AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE,
FEVERFEW WORKS FOR ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE WHO USE IT CONSISTENTLY. MY SISTERIN-LAW'S EXPERIENCE IS TYPICAL. BEFORE SHE TRIED FEVERFEW, SHE AVERAGED ABOUT
ONE MIGRAINE A WEEK AND SPENT ABOUT $200 A YEAR TRYING TO COUNTERACT THE PAIN.
IF WE ASSUME THAT THE ESTIMATED 25 MILLION AMERICANS WHO SUFFER FROM MIGRAINES ON A REGULAR BASIS SPEND IN THE SAME WAY THAT MY SISTER-IN-LAW DID, THAT
WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE $5 BILLION A YEAR FOR MIGRAINE MEDICATION. I DON'T THINK
THE PURVEYORS OF MODERN PHARMACEUTICALS WOULD BE PLEASED TO SEE FEVERFEW REPLACE THE MANY PROFITABLE DRUGS THAT ARE NOW PRESCRIBED FOR TREATING MIGRAINE.
THAT'S PARTLY WHY I'M SO INTERESTED IN PROMOTING THIS HERBAL ALTERNATIVE.
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. STUDIES PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AGREE THAT TAKING FEVERFEW REGULARLY PREVENTS MIGRAINE ATTACKS. AND ACCORDING
TO THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL HEALTH LETTER, "EATING FEVERFEW LEAVES HAS BECOME A POPULAR METHOD FOR PREVENTING MIGRAINE ATTACKS IN ENGLAND. SOME
233
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
PEOPLE FOR WHOM CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR MIGRAINE HAVE NOT WORKED HAVE
TURNED TO FEVERFEW WITH GOOD RESULTS." IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT I'M IN SUCH GOOD
COMPANY ON THIS ONE.
PEOPLE WHO USE FEVERFEW OFTEN USE FRESH LEAVES, TYPICALLY INGESTING ONE TO
FOUR LEAVES A DAY TO PREVENT MIGRAINES. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH HERB,
YOU MIGHT TRY THIS APPROACH, BUT DON'T EXPECT THE
LEAVES TO TASTE GOOD. AND SOME 10 TO 18 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE FRESH FEVERFEW
DEVELOP MOUTH SORES AND/OR INFLAMMATION OF THE MOUTH AND TONGUE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EAT THE LEAVES TO GET THE FULL
BENEFITS OF THIS HERB. YOU MAY BE ABLE
TO AVOID THE SIDE EFFECTS BY MAKING A
TEA WITH ABOUT TWO TO EIGHT FRESH LEAVES.
STEEP THEM IN BOILING WATER, BUT DO NOT
BOIL THEM, AS BOILING MAY BREAK DOWN
THE PARTHENOLIDES.
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE THIS HERB IN CAPSULES, WHICH IS REALLY THE EASIEST WAY TO
DO IT. DEPENDING ON THE POTENCY OF THE
HERB, DOSES MAY VARY FROM ONE CAPSULE
A DAY (60 MILLIGRAMS) TO SIX CAPSULES A
DAY (ABOUT 380 MILLIGRAMS) OF FRESH,
POWDERED LEAF OR TWO DAILY 25-MILLIGRAM CAPSULES OF FREEZE-DRIED LEAF.
FEVERFEW CAPSULES ARE SOLD AT MANY
HERB SHOPS AND HEALTH FOOD STORES. BY
ALL MEANS DISCUSS THE HERB WITH YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME ARRIVING AT
AN APPROPRIATE DOSE.
ONE CAVEAT: PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD NOT TAKE FEVERFEW BECAUSE OF A REMOTE
POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT TRIGGER MISCARRIAGE. AND WOMEN WHO ARE NURSING SHOULD
NOT USE IT BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PASSING THE HERB TO INFANTS IN BREAST MILK.
FINALLY, LONG-TERM USERS OFTEN REPORT A MILD TRANQUILIZING OR SEDATIVE EFFECT,
WHICH MAY BE WELCOME OR UNWELCOME, DEPENDING ON YOUR TEMPERAMENT.
V W WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). COMMISSION E, THE GROUP OF EXPERTS
THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, ENDORSES WILLOW BARK AS AN EFFECTIVE PAIN RELIEVER FOR HEADACHE AND ANYTHING ELSE TREATED BY WILLOW'S PHARMACEUTICAL DERIVATIVE, ASPIRIN.
FEVERFEW, WHICH IS KIN TO DANDELION
AND MARIGOLD, IS MOST FAMOUS FOR PREVENTING AND EVEN CURING MIGRAINES
AND OTHER HEADACHES.
234
HEADACH E
WHEN HERBALISTS TALK ABOUT WILLOW BARK AS HERBAL ASPIRIN, THEY USUALLY
MENTION WHITE WILLOW (5. ALBA). BUT THIS SPECIES IS RATHER LOW IN SALICIN, THE ASPIRIN-LIKE CHEMICAL IN THE BARK THAT RELIEVES PAIN. IF YOU WANT MORE HEADACHE
RELIEF PER CUP OF TEA, THERE ARE OTHER WILLOW SPECIES THAT ARE MORE POTENT: S.
DAPHNOIDES, S.FRAGILIS AND 5. PURPUREA.
COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS GETTING 60 TO 120 MILLIGRAMS OF SALICIN TO TREAT
A HEADACHE, WHICH WORKS OUT TO 1 TEASPOON OF THE HIGH-SALICIN BARKS OR 1 TO 1½
TEASPOONS OF WHITE WILLOW. MORE THAN 86 PERCENT OF THE SALICIN IN WILLOW IS ABSORBED BY THE DIGESTIVE TRACT, PROVIDING A GOOD BLOOD LEVEL OF THE CHEMICAL FOR
SEVERAL HOURS.
IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS,
EITHER. AND YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IF ASPIRIN UPSETS YOUR STOMACH, WILLOW
BARK MAY DO THE SAME. THEN AGAIN, IT MIGHT NOT. LEON CHAITOW, A BRITISH NATUROPATH AND OSTEOPATH, SAYS, "UNLIKE ASPIRIN, WHICH IS AN ISOLATED, CONCENTRATED
CHEMICAL, WILLOW BARK ACTS GENTLY AND WITHOUT ASPIRIN'S POTENTIAL FOR IRRITATING
THE STOMACH." ALSO, DO NOT GIVE EITHER ASPIRIN OR ITS NATURAL HERBAL ALTERNATIVES
TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE HEADACHES WITH VIRAL INFECTIONS SUCH AS COLDS OR FLU, AS
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT DEVELOP REYE'S SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY FATAL
CONDITION THAT DAMAGES THE LIVER AND BRAIN.
W EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST
SOURCES OF THE PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUND PHENYLALANINE. FOR THOSE WITH CHRONIC
HEADACHES, NUTRITIONISTS MAY RECOMMEND A DAILY DOSE OF SIX TO EIGHT CAPSULES OF
EVENING PRIMROSE OIL.
SUNFLOWER SEEDS ARE ALSO WELL-ENDOWED WITH PHENYLALANINE, WITH 4.8 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. OTHER GOOD SOURCES OF PHENYLALANINE, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY, INCLUDE WATERCRESS, BEAN SPROUTS, SOYBEANS,
PIGEONPEAS, SWAMP CABBAGE, LUPINES, PIGWEED GREENS, PEANUTS, LENTILS, YARDLONG BEANS, SPINACH, CAROB AND BUTTERNUT SQUASH.
W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A. CEPA). THE PLATELET CELLS
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BLOOD CLOTTING ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN TRIGGERING MIGRAINES. OF
COURSE, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOCK OUT YOUR PLATELETS ENTIRELY, BECAUSE THEN YOU'D
BLEED TO DEATH FROM MINOR CUTS. MAKING THE PLATELETS A LITTLE LESS ACTIVE, HOWEVER,
APPARENTFY HELPS PREVENT MIGRAINES. NATUROPATHS SUGGEST EATING LOTS OF GARLIC AND
ONIONS, BECAUSE THESE BLOOD-THINNING HERBS INTERFERE SOMEWHAT WITH PLATELET ACTIVITY. (THAT'S ALSO WHY THEY'RE RECOMMENDED FOR PREVENTING HEART ATTACK.)
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). PEOPLE IN ASIAN CULTURES OFTEN USE
GINGER TO PREVENT MIGRAINES. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY GOOD STUDIES ON THIS, BUT I AM
AWARE OF AN INTRIGUING ANECDOTE: ONE 42-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO HAD REGULAR MIGRAINES STOPPED TAKING ALL OTHER MIGRAINE MEDICINES AND INSTEAD TOOK 500 TO 600
235
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
MILLIGRAMS OF DRY GINGER MIXED IN WATER AT THE ONSET OF THE VISUAL DISTURBANCES ASSOCIATED WITH MIGRAINE. SHE'D THEN TAKE THE SAME DOSE EVERY FOUR HOURS FOR FOUR
DAYS. STARTING WITHIN ABOUT 30 MINUTES, HER MIGRAINE EPISODE WAS MUCH LESS
PAINFUL AND DISCONCERTING. LATER SHE SWITCHED FROM DRIED GINGER TO FRESH GINGER.
MIGRAINES RARELY RECURRED, AND WHEN THEY DID, THEY WERE LESS FREQUENT.
SINCE GINGER IS GOOD FOR YOU IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, IT SEEMS LIKE THIS
APPROACH IS CERTAINLY WORTH A TRY. IF YOU OPT FOR GINGER POWDER, TRY 500 MILLIGRAMS OF DRY GINGER IN CAPSULES. IF YOU PREFER FRESH GINGER, THE EQUIVALENT
AMOUNT IS FIVE GRAMS (ABOUT 2½ TEASPOONS) OF FRESH, GRATED ROOT.
FOR GREATER EFFECT, YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO COMBINE GINGER WITH ANOTHER
HERB. NATUROPATHS SOMETIMES SUGGEST TAKING TURMERIC, WHICH IS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND SHARES MANY OF GINGER'S MEDICINAL ACTIVITIES. IF I HAD A MIGRAINE, I THINK I'D TRY A COUPLE OF TEASPOONS OF EACH IN A GLASS OF LEMONADE, AS
NEEDED.
W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). A MEDICAL STUDY FOUND THAT HEADACHES OFTEN
CLEAR UP WITH INCREASED CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. THAT'S WHAT GINKGO DOES—IMPROVE
BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE BRAIN. IF I HAD FREQUENT HEADACHES, FD PROBABLY TRY THIS
HERB. FD SUGGEST TAKING 30 DROPS OF A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT CONTAINING AT LEAST 0.5
PERCENT FLAVONOID GLYCOSIDES THREE TIMES A DAY FOR A DAY OR TWO. YOU COULD ALSO
TAKE CAPSULES; FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A
DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
VV RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE HOT INGREDIENT IN RED
PEPPER, CAPSAICIN, IS ALSO A MARVELOUS PAIN RELIEVER. EIGHT STUDIES I'M AWARE OF
SHOW THAT EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS OF CAPSAICIN INTERFERE WITH SUBSTANCE P, A CHEMICAL
THAT SCIENTISTS BELIEVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TRANSMITTING PAIN IMPULSES.
TAKEN INTERNALLY, RED PEPPER LOOKS GOOD FOR TREATING HEADACHE. IT IS REPORTEDLY THE RICHEST FOOD SOURCE OF ASPIRIN-LIKE SALICYLATES.
CAPSAICIN HAS BEEN SHOWN IN STUDIES TO HELP PREVENT CLUSTER HEADACHES,
WHICH ARE PAINFULLY SIMILAR TO MIGRAINES. IN ONE SMALL STUDY OF 12 PEOPLE WITH
THIS TYPE OF HEADACHE, 6 (50 PERCENT) WHO INHALED ONE GRAM OF CAPSAICIN UP
THEIR NOSES THREE TIMES A DAY FOR SEVERAL DAYS GOT COMPLETE RELIEF, 4 REPORTED
PARTIAL RELIEF, AND ONLY 2 EXPERIENCED NO RELIEF. SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES SHOW SIMILAR RESULTS.
IF I HAD EITHER A MIGRAINE OR A CLUSTER HEADACHE, FD TRY CAYENNE FOR RELIEF.
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T INHALE IT; YOU CAN SIMPLY TAKE CAPSULES.
V LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS). THIS HERB, ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA,
CAN BE HELPFUL IN TREATING MIGRAINE, ACCORDING TO NORMAN G. BISSET, PH.D., PROFESSOR OF PHARMACY AT KING'S COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND AUTHOR OF
236
HEADACHE
HERBAL DRUGS AND PHYTOPHARMACEIUICALS. COMMISSION E ENDORSES THIS HERB FOTHIS USE.
THE RECOMMENDED DOSE IS A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED
HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEPED UNTIL COOL. IF I HAD A HEADACHE, FD
SPIKE MY LEMON BALM TEA WITH FEVERFEW, GINGER AND TURMERIC.
V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). WHEN MIXED WITH A LITTLE ALCOHOL AND
RUBBED ON THE TEMPLES, PEPPERMINT OIL HELPS ALLEVIATE HEADACHE PAIN. FD MIX MY
PEPPERMINT OIL WITH LAVENDER AND ADD EUCALYPTUS AND ROSEMARY IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE. I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THESE HEALING OILS CAN WORK TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY. BUT
REMEMBER, THESE OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING MAGNESIUM. NUTRITIONISTS SUGGEST GETTING 600 MILLIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM A DAY IF
YOU'RE PRONE TO HEADACHES. (THE DAILY VALUE IS 400 MILLIGRAMS.) I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN MAGNESIUM'S RELATIONSHIP TO HEADACHE, BECAUSE MAGNESIUM
DEFICIENCY HAS BEEN FOUND IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE FREQUENT TENSION HEADACHES OR
MIGRAINES.
ALSO, ACCORDING TO A GALLUP SURVEY, AN ESTIMATED 72 PERCENT OF AMERICANS
REPORT HAVING A MAGNESIUM INTAKE THAT WOULD RESULT IN DEFICIENCY. COULD THERE
BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PREVALENCE OF LOW MAGNESIUM AND HEADACHE? PERHAPS. IT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T HURT TO GET MORE OF THIS VITAL MINERAL IN YOUR DIET.
BESIDES LEAFY GREENS LIKE PURSLANE, LEGUMES AND WHOLE GRAINS ARE GOOD FOOD
SOURCES OF MAGNESIUM. IN MY DATABASE, PURSLANE IS THE CLEAR LEADER IN THIS NUTRIENT WITH NEARLY 2 PERCENT MAGNESIUM ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS, BUT GREEN BEANS,
POPPY SEEDS, OATS, COWPEAS AND SPINACH ARE CLOSE BEHIND.
V TANSY (TANA CE TURN VULGARE). LIKE FEVERFEW, TANSY CONTAINS PARTHENOLIDES, WHICH MAY HELP PREVENT MIGRAINES. (PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD NOT USE TANSY,
THOUGH, AS IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE MISCARRIAGE.)
V THYME (THYMUS VULGARIS). MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN,
PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMAN S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, SGESTS DRINKING THYME TEA. TRY ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF HOT WATER. HE
ALSO SUGGESTS USING IT IN COMPRESSES TO EASE THE ACHING MUSCLES IN THE NECK,
SHOULDERS AND BACK THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO TENSION HEADACHES.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). AS I'VE MENTIONED, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY
THIS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, PARTICULARLY IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER HERB, LIKE GINGER.
V ASSORTED HERBS. THERE ARE ALMOST TOO MANY FOODS THAT ARE USED AS FOLK
REMEDIES FOR HEADACHE, AND MANY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DEFINITELY CONTAIN PAINRELIEVING COMPOUNDS. ONE OF MY OWN FAVORITE PAIN-RELIEVING TEAS IS A MIXTURE OF
CINNAMON, LEMONGRASS, PEPPERMINT AND ROSEMARY.
OTHER HERBS THAT ARE POSSIBLY WORTH A TRY INCLUDE BASIL, BLACK PEPPER, CAR237
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L

HEARTBURN
A
COLLEAGUE, WHO NEVER STRUCK ME AS HERBALLY INCLINED, DROPPED BY MY
OFFICE ONE MORNING AND SURPRISED ME BY ASKING WHAT SORT OF HERBAL
CONCOCTION I MIGHT RECOMMEND FOR HEARTBURN. HE SAID HE'D HAD IT ON AND OFF
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. BUT HE'D STARTED TAKING GINGER ABOUT A WEEK EARLIER, AND HE
SAID HE FELT CONSIDERABLY BETTER.
I WAS DELIGHTED THAT HE'D TRIED AN HERB, BUT I WAS ALSO A LITTLE SURPRISED AT
HIS SUCCESS. STUDIES SHOW THAT GINGER PREVENTS NAUSEA CAUSED BY MOTION SICKNESS AS WELL AS MORNING SICKNESS IN PREGNANT WOMEN. THAT'S HOW IT HAS EARNED
ITS WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION AS A STOMACH SOOTHER. BUT HEARTBURN DOES NOT
OCCUR IN THE STOMACH.
HEARTBURN DEVELOPS WHEN THE MUSCULAR OPENING FROM THE ESOPHAGUS INTO
THE STOMACH DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY. THIS SET OF MUSCLES—THE LOWER ESOPHAGEAL
SPHINCTER (LES)—OPENS TO ALLOW FOOD INTO THE STOMACH BUT THEN CLOSES TO KEEP
STOMACH ACIDS FROM WASHING UP INTO THE ESOPHAGUS. IN HEARTBURN, THE LES
DOESN'T CLOSE COMPLETELY, AND THE BURNING FEELING IN THE CHEST IS ACTUALLY ACID
BURNING THE ESOPHAGUS.
I'D NEVER HEARD OF GINGER FOR LES PROBLEMS, BUT I DIDN'T DOUBT HIM. I
SIMPLY SUGGESTED THAT HE ADD PEPPERMINT TO HIS GINGER TEA. PEPPERMINT HAS AN
AGE-OLD REPUTATION FOR RELIEVING UPSET STOMACH AND HEARTBURN, AND A GOOD DEAL
OF RESEARCH VALIDATES THE FOLKLORE.
HEARTBURN IS VERY COMMON. AN ESTIMATED 30 PERCENT OF ADULTS EXPERIENCE
IT AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH. DIET AND LIFESTYLE OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO IT.
HEARTBURN IS MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP WHEN YOU EAT HURRIEDLY, ON THE RUN,
STANDING UP OR WOLFING DOWN YOUR FOOD WITHOUT CHEWING IT THOROUGHLY. FRIED
FOODS, SATURATED FATS, SUGAR, ALCOHOL, CIGARETTES AND COFFEE HAVE ALL BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HEARTBURN. TO HELP PREVENT IT, TRY TO HAVE MEALS AND SNACKS WHEN
YOU'RE RELAXED INSTEAD OF ON THE GO. IT ALSO HELPS TO HAVE A DIET OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND WHOLE GRAINS AND AVOID FRIED FOODS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HEARTBURN
IN ADDITION TO AVOIDING AGGRAVATING FOODS AND EATING HABITS, HERE ARE SOME
HERBS THAT CAN HELP.
238
HEARTBUR N
W ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHA
GELICA) AND RELATIVES. AROMATHERAPISTS WISELY SUGGEST OIL OF ANGELICA AS
USEFUL FOR HEARTBURN IN ADULTS AND
COLIC AND GAS IN CHILDREN. ANGELICA IS
A MEMBER OF THE CARROT FAMILY, AND
MANY MEMBERS OF THAT PLANT FAMILY
SEEM TO HAVE A SOOTHING ACTION ON THE
DIGESTIVE TRACT, A QUALITY THAT HERBALISTS CALL CARMINATIVE.
IF YOU HAVE HEARTBURN FREQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD DISCUSS IT WITH
YOUR DOCTOR. YOU MIGHT ALSO WISH TO
INDULGE IN MY ANGELADE, WHICH CONTAINS SIX RELATIVES OF ANGELICA, ALL
CARMINATIVE. YOU'LL NEED A JUICER TO
MAKE THIS ONE, AS ANGELADE CONSISTS
OF JUICED ANGELICA STALKS, CARROTS,
CELERY, FENNEL, GARLIC, PARSLEY AND
PARSNIPS. (YOU MAY HAVE TO ADD
SOME WATER AND SPICES TO MAKE IT
DRINKABLE.)
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH ANGELICA, IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE IT OUT AND GO
WITH JUST THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. IN FACT, IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
HOW MUCH OF EACH YOU USE. SIMPLY PICK YOUR FAVORITES, THEN MIX AND MATCH
UNTIL YOU CREATE A JUICE THAT TICKLES YOUR FANCY.
W CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). JOE AND TERRY GRAEDON, CO-AUTHORS
OF THE PEOPLES PHARMACY AND GRAEDONS BEST MEDICINE, SHARE MY OPINION THAT
CAMOMILE IS THE FIRST-CHOICE HERB FOR HEARTBURN AND STOMACH DISTRESS.
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). I AGREE WITH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D.,
CO-AUTHOR OF ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOLARLY
BOOKS ON NUTRITIONAL AND NATUROPATHIC HEALING, THAT DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED LICORICE
(DGL) SUCCESSFULLY TREATS BOTH HEARTBURN AND ULCERS OF THE STOMACH AND ESOPHAGUS. MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT LICORICE IS AN ANTISPASMODIC AND THAT IT REDUCES
PRODUCTION OF STOMACH ACID, THEREBY DECREASING HEARTBURN.
THE CAVEAT IS THAT WHILE LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN
MODERATE AMOUNTS (UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY) LONG-TERM USE (MORE
THAN SIX WEEKS) OR INGESTION OF LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY,
SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND HIGH BLOOD PRES239
•R
ANGELICA FOR ANGINA
• ANGELICA IS GOOD FOR TREATING HEARTBURN,
AND ALTHOUGH HEARTBURN DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE HEART, ANGELICA, CU-
• RIOUSLY ENOUGH, IS ALSO GOOD FOR THE HEART.
\ ANGELICA AND OTHER PLANTS IN THE
J CARROT FAMILY CONTAIN SOME 15 CALCIUM
{ CHANNEL BLOCKERS, CHEMICALS THAT HAVE
J BEEN TURNED INTO PHARMACEUTICALS TO TREAT
J ANGINA, THE CHRONIC CHEST PAIN THAT OFTEN

J ISOPTIN), AN ANGINA MEDICATION.

; ROTS, AND PERHAPS THIS PARTIALLY EXPLAINS
THE LOWER INCIDENCE OF HEART PROBLEMS
\ THAT THEY ENJOY AS A GROUP.
IL-..~ •• -.....-,.. - - ^—.
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
DON'T DIE
SOMETIMES HEARTBURN HURTS SO MUCH THAT
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK,
ALTHOUGH ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT. BUT THE REVERSE CAN BE TRUE AS WELL: SOMETIMES WHAT
YOU THINK IS HEARTBURN IS ACTUALLY A HEART
ATTACK OR ANGINA.
HEARTBURN TYPICALLY DEVELOPS DURING
OR SHORTLY AFTER A MEAL AND PRODUCES PAIN
OR BURNING IN THE CHEST. HEART ATTACK AND
ANGINA CAN STRIKE AT ANY TIME. FREQUENTLY,
THE PAIN THEY PRODUCE IS NOT LIMITED TO THE
CHEST BUT RADIATES UP UNDER THE JAW OR
ALONG AN ARM. HEART ATTACK AND ANGINA
MAY ALSO PRODUCE FAINTNESS AND SWEATING.
WHEN IN DOUBT ABOUT CHEST PAIN, CALL 911
AND DESCRIBE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
I SURE. A CUP OF LICORICE TEA NOW AND
THEN TO RELIEVE HEARTBURN IS SAFE.
^ ^ PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA), A WHILE BACK, MY DAUGHTER
SPENT A VACATION WEEK WITH US, AND WE
CELEBRATED BY GRILLING UP BIG SLABS OF
SPARERIBS, WHICH GAVE ME HEARTBURN.
SO I HEADED OUT TO THE GARDEN AND
GRABBED TWO HANDFULS OF PEPPERMINT
AND ONE EACH OF SPEARMINT, LEMON
BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA) AND BEE
BALM, ALONG WITH SOME BASIL, SAGE AND
OREGANO, AND BREWED UP A TASTY TEA THAT
HELPED. I KNOW YOU MIGHT PREFER A
MORE SPECIFIC RECIPE—ONE TEASPOON OF
THIS, TWO TEASPOONS OF THAT—BUT I
NEVER MEASURE HERBS THAT ARE GENERALLY
REGARDED AS SAFE.
THERE IS A CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE
'"""" ~~
 , ' ' — USE OF PEPPERMINT FOR HEARTBURN. I
AGREE WITH HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW
WEIL, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN
TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, WHO STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THIS HERB. HERBAL LORE CERTAINLY SUPPORTS PEPPERMINT. TRADITIONAL CULTURES FROM ANCIENT EGYPTIANS TO PRESENT-DAY ICELANDERS USE PEPPERMINT FOR ALL
SORTS OF DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING HEARTBURN.
A FEW ESTEEMED HERBALISTS, HOWEVER, CONTEND THAT PEPPERMINT CAN AGGRAVATE HEARTBURN. IF THAT HAPPENS TO YOU, DON'T USE THIS HERB, BUT PERSONALLY, I
DOUBT THAT YOU'LL HAVE PROBLEMS. MANY, IF NOT MOST, MINTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO
EASE DIGESTION, WITH PEPPERMINT AND SPEARMINT TOPS IN MY BOOK.
V CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM) AND CINNAMON (CINNAMOMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). BOTH OF THESE HERBS HELP ELIMINATE GAS. WHEN
MRS. DUKE SUFFERS OCCASIONAL HEARTBURN OR ACID INDIGESTION, ONE THING SHE DOES
WITH MY BLESSING IS SPRINKLE ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE TWO POWDERED HERBS ON HER
TOAST. (WE RARELY HAVE CARDAMOM AROUND THE HOUSE, THOUGH; IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.)
V DILL (ANETHUM GRAVEOLENS). DILL HAS BEEN USED TO SOOTHE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT AND TREAT HEARTBURN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IF I HAD HEARTBURN, I'D TRY
CRUSHING A FEW TEASPOONS OF SEEDS AND MAKING A TEA WITH IT. (IF YOU ARE PREGNANT,
240
HEARTBUR N
USING DILL IN MEDICINAL AMOUNTS COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS. YOU SHOULD RESERVE IT FOR
OCCASIONAL, MODERATE USE.)
V FENNEL (FOENICULWN VULGARE). FENNEL HAS BEEN USED AS LONG AS DILL,
AND FOR THE SAME REASONS. I'D USE IT, TOO.
V GENTIAN (GENTIUNA OFFICINALIS). HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL
MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIEN- ^
TIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE
AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, NOTES
THAT GENTIAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN TAKEN
ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE MEALS, IS A
REMARKABLE HEARTBURN PREVENTIVE
THAT ALSO AIDS DIGESTION. I AGREE. GENTIAN HAS A LONG HISTORY AS A DIGESTIVE
HERB. I WOULD TRY SIMMERING ONE TEASPOON OF GENTIAN IN A CUP OR TWO OF
WATER FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. DR.
MOWREY ALSO SUGGESTS ADDING A
SPRINKLE OF CAYENNE AND GINGER TO
YOUR GENTIAN TEA.
V PAPAYA (CARICA PAPAYA)
AND PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). THESE FRUITS ARE LOADED WITH
DIGESTIVE ENZYMES AND HAVE BEEN
WIDELY USED TO RELIEVE HEARTBURN AND
INDIGESTION. PAPAYA WITH A LITTLE
HONEY MAY EVEN PREVENT IT IF EATEN
BEFORE A MEAL OR BETWEEN COURSES.
SOME NUTRITIONISTS SUGGEST THAT KIWIFRUIT MIGHT HELP AS WELL.
V HERBAL FORMULAS. I HAVE A
LOT OF RESPECT FOR BRITISH HERBALIST
DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF A DOZEN
OR SO BOOKS, INCLUDING THE HERBAL
HANDBOOK. HE RECOMMENDS SEVERAL COMBINATIONS OF HERBS FOR DIGESTIVE TRACT
PROBLEMS. TEAS MADE FROM EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING TWO FORMULAS MIGHT BE USEFUL
FOR HEARTBURN.
DIGESTIVE FORMULA: TWO PARTS COMFREY LEAF, WHICH SOOTHES THE DIGESTIVE
TRACT; TWO PARTS HOLLYHOCK (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS), ANOTHER STOMACH SOOTHER; ONE
ON COMFREY
COMFREY HAS DEVELOPED A BAD REPUTATION.
ALTHOUGH MANY HERBALISTS CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THE HERB, SOME AUTHORITIES SAY THAT
YOU SHOULDN'T INGEST ANY AT ALL. THAT'S BECAUSE MEDICAL RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT
COMFREY CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN AS
PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS (PAS). IN SUFFICIENT
AMOUNTS, PAS CAN CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE AND
POSSIBLY CANCER.
I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD DRINK
COMFREY TEA BY THE GALLON EVERY DAY, BUT
I'M NOT AFRAID OF A LITTLE COMFREY NOW AND
THEN, EVEN THOUGH THE HERB CLEARLY CONTAINS THESE SUBSTANCES. I BASE MY POSITION
ON STUDIES DONE BY BIOCHEMIST BRUCE
AMES, PH.D., OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY.
DR. AMES SPECIALIZES IN ESTIMATING
THE CARCINOGENICITY (CANCER-CAUSING POTENTIAL) OF FOOD ITEMS. ACCORDING TO HIS
FINDINGS, A CUP OF COMFREY LEAF TEA IS LESS
CARCINOGENIC THAN A CAN OF BEER. AND I'M
NOT GOING TO GIVE THAT UP, EITHER!
241
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
PART SWEETFLAG (ACORUS CALAMUS), WHICH HAS ANTACID AND GAS-RELIEVING PROPERTIES; AND ONE PART MEADOWSWEET, WHICH IS BOTH ANTACID AND GAS RELIEVING.
ESOPHAGITIS FORMULA: TWO PARTS COMFREY; TWO PARTS HOLLYHOCK; ONE PART
CAMOMILE, WHICH IS BOTH A GAS RELIEVER AND AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY; AND ONE PART
MARIGOLD, WHICH IS ALSO AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY.
V SALAD FROM THE BIBLE. SEVERAL PLANTS MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE HAVE
FOLKLORE REPUTATIONS FOR BEING HELPFUL. THESE INCLUDE ALMOND, CHICORY, DANDELION,
GARLIC, LETTUCE, MUSTARD, OLIVES, ONIONS AND WALNUTS. IF I SUFFERED FREQUENT HEARTBURN, I'D TRY MAKING A SALAD WITH SEVERAL OF THESE ANTI-HEARTBURN INGREDIENTS.
HEART DISEASE
D
EAN ORNISH, M.D., IS A CALIFORNIA DOCTOR WHO ASTOUNDED THE MEDICAL
WORLD A FEW YEARS AGO BY BECOMING THE FIRST RESEARCHER TO ACTUALLY REVERSE HEART DISEASE. EVEN MORE AMAZING, HE DID IT WITH A LOW-TECH COMBINATION
OF NATURAL APPROACHES: EXERCISE, YOGA, MEDITATION, SUPPORT GROUPS AND A VERY
LOW FAT VEGETARIAN DIET (10 PERCENT OF CALORIES FROM FAT).
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED A STORY THAT DR. ORNISH TELLS ABOUT A GROUP OF RABBITS THAT
ADDED AN UNEXPECTED TIDBIT TO THE RESEARCH ON HEART DISEASE. KEPT IN A LABORATORY UNDER RESEARCH CONDITIONS, THE RABBITS WERE GENETICALLY SIMILAR, AND ALL RECEIVED THE SAME FOOD AND GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF EXERCISE, YET ONE GROUP HAD
60 PERCENT FEWER HEART ATTACKS THAN THE OTHERS. WHAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE? IT
TURNED OUT THAT THE HEALTHIER RABBITS WERE THE ONES KEPT IN THE LOWER CAGES, AND
THE SHORT PERSON WHO FED THE RABBITS COULD REACH THE LOWER ANIMALS AND PET THEM
WHEN FEEDING THEM. LOVE, IT SEEMS, IS A LIFE PRESERVER. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT SO.
PREVENTING? CLOGGED PIPES
IN HEART DISEASE—OR MORE ACCURATELY, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE—THE ARTERIES THAT NOURISH THE HEART BECOME CLOGGED. THIS DISEASE IS OUR NUMBER ONE
CAUSE OF DEATH. IT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 7 MILLION AMERICANS AND CAUSES ABOUT
1.5 MILLION HEART ATTACKS AND 500,000 DEATHS EACH YEAR.
MAINSTREAM MEDICINE HASN'T YET ADOPTED THE SAFE, GENTLE, NATURAL ORNISH
APPROACH. INSTEAD, OUR TAXES AND HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS GO TO FINANCE AP242
HEAR T DISEAS E
PROXIMATELY 300,000 CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS OPERATIONS EACH YEAR AT A COST OF
ABOUT $30,000 EACH, OR $9 BILLION TOTAL.
BYPASS SURGERY IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX. THE BYPASSES THEMSELVES USUALLY
CLOG UP AFTER A FEW MONTHS OR YEARS. IF THE $9 BILLION SPENT ON BYPASSES WENT
INSTEAD INTO NATURAL THERAPIES AND PREVENTIVE APPROACHES, THE U.S. HEALTH
SYSTEM WOULD BE BETTER OFF.
PREVENTIVE THERAPIES INCLUDE TREATING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND ELEVATED
CHOLESTEROL AND DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENCOURAGE AMERICANS TO QUIT
SMOKING, LOSE WEIGHT, EXERCISE MORE, MANAGE THEIR STRESS MORE EFFECTIVELY AND
CULTIVATE MORE SOCIAL SUPPORT.
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) RECOGNIZES THE VALUE OF PREVENTION. IN A 1994 REPORT, THE NIH SAID: "FOR HEALTH-CARE REFORM TO SUCCEED AT REDUCING COSTS .. . DISEASE PREVENTION MUST BE THE ULTIMATE FOCUS OF THE PRIMARY
HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM, RATHER THAN DISEASE TREATMENT." I JUST WISH DOCTORS WOULD
EMBRACE THIS CONCEPT.
\FEG(ETAME POWER
ONE OF MY FAVORITE APPROACHES TO PREVENTING—AND RECOVERING FROM—HEART
ATTACK IS ONE YOU WON'T FIND IN ANY MEDICAL TEXTS. IT'S VEGETABLE SOUP. MOST
PEOPLE CALL IT MINESTRONE, BUT I CALL IT MEDISTRONE BECAUSE IT'S AS MUCH A MEDICINE AS A FOOD.
THERE IS NO RECIPE FOR THIS SOUP. YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE APPROPRIATE INGREDIENTS, WHICH I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE, AND COMBINE THEM INTO ANY NUMBER OF DELICIOUS SOUPS. THE IDEA IS TO CONCENTRATE ON SEASONAL VEGETABLES AND MAKE IT A
LITTLE DIFFERENT EACH TIME, SO YOU NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS HEALTHFUL DISH. IT SOON
BECOMES A HABIT THAT YOU'LL ENJOY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
SOME OF THE VEGETABLES AND HERBS I USE IN VEGETABLE SOUP, NOTABLY GARLIC,
ONIONS, GINGER AND RED PEPPER, MAKE THE BLOOD LESS LIKELY TO CLOT, THUS PREVENTING THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER HEART ATTACK. GARLIC AND ONION ALSO HELP REDUCE CHOLESTEROL AND BLOOD PRESSURE.
OTHER VEGETABLES, PARTICULARLY TOMATOES, CONTAIN THE COMPOUND GAMMAAMINO BUTYRIC ACID (GABA). LATELY I'VE BECOME FASCINATED BY THIS COMPOUND.
ACCORDING TO STUDIES, THE GABA IN TOMATOES AND MANY OTHER SOUP VEGETABLES
APPEARS TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HELP STRENGTHEN THE HEART MUSCLE. TO
MEDISTRONE'S TOMATO BASE WE ADD OTHER HERBS, SPICES AND VEGETABLES THAT HELP
REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE, AMONG THEM THE AFOREMENTIONED ONIONS AND GARLIC PLUS
RICE, CELERY AND SAFFRON.
243
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
STILL OTHER VEGETABLES THAT YOU MIGHT ADD TO MEDISTRONE THAT HELP LOWER CHOLESTEROL ARE ARTICHOKES, BARLEY, BEANS, CARROTS, EGGPLANT AND SPINACH.
IN ADDITION, MY MEDISTRONE CONTAINS VEGETABLES HIGH IN GLUTATHIONE, A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT. ANTIOXIDANTS HELP PREVENT ARTERY-CLOGGING PLAQUE FROM BEING
DEPOSITED ON CORONARY ARTERY WALLS. YOU CAN FIND HEALTHY AMOUNTS IN ASPARAGUS,
BROCCOLI, CABBAGE, CAULIFLOWER, POTATOES, PURSLANE AND TOMATOES. (IT'S ALSO FOUND
IN AVOCADOS, GRAPEFRUIT, ORANGES, PEACHES AND WATERMELON, BUT I WOULDN'T USE
THESE IN MY SOUP.)
ALL OF THE VEGETABLES THAT YOU MIGHT USE IN MEDISTRONE ARE LOW IN FAT AND
HAVE LITTLE OR NO CHOLESTEROL, SO THEY CAN HELP CONTROL WEIGHT, BLOOD PRESSURE
AND CHOLESTEROL. VEGETABLES CAN EVEN PROVIDE GOOD EXERCISE IF YOU GROW THEM
YOURSELF.
SO IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HEART ATTACK, BY ALL MEANS HAVE MEDISTRONE AS A
MEAL ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK—OR MORE IF YOU WANT. YOU CAN MAKE A BIG POT EARLY IN
THE WEEK, THEN FREEZE PORTION-SIZE SERVINGS AND HAVE IT WHENEVER YOU WANT. I
SPECULATE THAT SIMPLY BY REPLACING A FEW MEAT OR CHEESE MEALS A WEEK WITH
MEDISTRONE, YOU MAY REDUCE YOUR RISK OF HEART ATTACK BY ABOUT 20 PERCENT.
MORE REASONS FOR EATING TOUR VEGGIES
DON'T STOP WITH MEDISTRONE. THERE'S SUCH STRONG SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN
FAVOR OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR PREVENTING HEART DISEASE THAT YOU SHOULD
MAKE THEM PART OF EVERY MEAL.
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE OUR MAIN SOURCES OF POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS: VITAMINS C AND E, THE VITAMIN A-LIKE CAROTENOIDS AND FOLATE, A B VITAMIN. MANY
STUDIES SHOW THAT AS DIETARY CONSUMPTION OF THESE NUTRIENTS INCREASES, RISK OF
HEART ATTACK PLUMMETS BY UP TO 40 PERCENT. (AND CANCER RISK DROPS ABOUT 50
PERCENT AS WELL).
NO WONDER THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
AND MOST NUTRITIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES URGE ALL AMERICANS TO "STRIVE FOR FIVE."
THIS MEANS GETTING AT LEAST FIVE SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A DAY.
KEEP IN MIND, THOUGH, THAT FIVE IS JUST THE HEALTHY MINIMUM. MANY NUTRITIONISTS ENCOURAGE EIGHT OR NINE SERVINGS A DAY. THAT'S A VERY TALL ORDER, CONSIDERING THAT ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF ALL AMERICANS GET EVEN FIVE, ACCORDING TO
GLADYS BLOCK, PH.D., A NUTRITIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY. IT'S STARTING TO SOUND AS IF A BETTER SLOGAN WOULD BE "TEND TOWARD TEN." IN 1997,1 LAUNCHED MY OWN CAMPAIGN CALLED STRIVE FOR FIVE TIMES
FIVE (FRUITS, HERBS, LEGUMES AND GRAINS, NUTS AND VEGETABLES).
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF WE PUT THE $9 BILLION THAT GOES FOR BYPASSES INTO A
244
HEAR T DISEAS E
BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO GET AMERICANS TO EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGGIES, WE'D
SEE FEWER HEART ATTACKS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HEART DISEASE
I'VE ALREADY SAID THAT GARLIC, ONIONS, GINGER AND RED PEPPER HELP PREVENT
AND TREAT HEART DISEASE BY REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE AND THAT GARLIC AND ONIONS
ALSO CUT CHOLESTEROL AND DISCOURAGE THE BLOOD FROM FORMING CLOTS. IF YOU KNOW
MUCH ABOUT HERBS, THAT INFORMATION PROBABLY ISN'T NEWS TO YOU. BUT YOU MAY
NOT KNOW THAT MANY OTHER HERBS CAN HELP PREVENT AND TREAT HEART DISEASE.
V W PIGWEED (AMARANTHIIS, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER PLANTS CONTAINING CALCIUM. PIGWEED LEAVES ARE ONE OF OUR BEST PLANT SOURCES OF CALCIUM
(ABOUT 5.3 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS). STUDIES SUGGEST THAT CALCIUM ADDS
MINERAL DENSITY TO BONE, WHICH CAN HELP PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS. BUT THERE'S
MORE: THE MINERAL ALSO SIGNIFICANDY REDUCES HEART ATTACK RISK.
OTHER HIGH-CALCIUM PLANTS INCLUDE LAMB'S-QUARTERS, STINGING NETTLE, BROADBEANS, WATERCRESS, LICORICE, MARJORAM, SAVORY, RED CLOVER SHOOTS AND THYME.
IN ADDITION TO CALCIUM, PIGWEED IS HIGH IN FIBER. A SIX-YEAR HARVARD STUDY
OF MORE THAN 40,000 MEN SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO CONSUMED THE
LEAST FIBER, THOSE WHO ATE THE MOST HAD JUST ONE-THIRD THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK.
YOU CAN ADD PIGWEED TO SALADS, MIXED VEGETABLE DISHES AND MEDISTRONE.
V%^ WILLOW (SAHX) VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK CONTAINS SALICIN, THE
HERBAL PRECURSOR OF ASPIRIN. A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN—ONE-HALF TO ONE STANDARD TABLET A DAY—CAN REDUCE HEART ATTACK RISK
SUBSTANTIALLY BY PREVENTING THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER IT.
THE BODY CONVERTS ASPIRIN INTO SALICYLIC ACID, AND IT ALSO CONVERTS THE
SALICIN IN WILLOW BARK INTO SALICYLIC ACID. SO IF PHARMACEUTICAL ASPIRIN HELPS
PREVENT HEART ATTACK, HERBAL ASPIRIN SHOULD, TOO. IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN,
THOUGH, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE HERBAL ASPIRIN EITHER.
TYPICALLY, PEOPLE USE THE BARK OF THE WHITE WILLOW (5. ALBA), BUT SEVERAL
OTHER SPECIES ARE RICHER IN SALICIN, INCLUDING CRACK WILLOW (S.FRAGILIS) AND
PURPLE OSIER (S. PURPUREA). IF WHITE WILLOW IS THE ONLY KIND YOU CAN FIND AT YOUR
HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB SHOP, THOUGH, THAT'S OKAY.
ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON TO A TEASPOON OF WHITE WILLOW BARK CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 100,000 PARTS PER MILLION OF SALICIN, OR ABOUT 100 MILLIGRAMS. AFTER IT'S
CONVERTED INTO SALICYLIC ACID, THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ASPIRIN'S
HEART-PROTECTIVE EFFECT.
I'D SUGGEST BREWING A TEA WITH A TEASPOON OF SO OF BARK TO A CUP OF BOILING
WATER. STEEP FOR 15 MINUTES AND STRAIN. YOU CAN TRY DRINKING ONE CUP A DAY OR
ONE EVERY OTHER DAY.
245
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VV ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA). DOCTORS ROUTINELY PRESCRIBE CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS SUCH AS VERAPAMIL (CALAN, ISOPTIN) TO PREVENT HEART ATTACK.
THIS IS A CLASS OF DRUGS THAT WORKS BY HELPING TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE.
ANGELICA CONTAINS 15 SEPARATE COMPOUNDS THAT ARE CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS.
IF YOU ARE TAKING A PRESCRIBED CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER, I WOULD NOT ADVISE ABANDONING YOUR MEDICATION IN FAVOR OF ANGELICA, BUT I DO SUSPECT THAT ADDING THIS HERB
TO YOUR REGIMEN WOULD IMPROVE THE OVERALL EFFECT OF YOUR MEDICATION. YOU SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS HERB WITH YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY IT.
I MAKE A CONCOCTION CALLED ANGELADE, WHICH CONSISTS OF JUICED ANGELICA
STALKS, CARROTS, CELERY, FENNEL, GARLIC, PARSLEY AND PARSNIPS, WITH SOME WATER AND
SPICES FOR DRINKABILITY. IT'S VERY TASTY, AND ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS CONTAIN EITHER CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS, ANTIOXIDANTS OR COMPOUNDS THAT LOWER CHOLESTEROL OR BLOOD
PRESSURE, THUS HELPING TO PREVENT HEART DISEASE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
W GRAPE (VITIS VINIFERA). SOME 30 LONG-TERM STUDIES AGREE THAT MODERATE
ALCOHOL DRINKERS—THOSE WHO HAVE ONE OR TWO DRINKS A DAY—REDUCE THEIR HEART
ATTACK RISK BY SOME 25 TO 40 PERCENT. MEANWHILE, A DEBATE RAGES ABOUT WHY.
SOME RESEARCHERS SAY THAT ALCOHOL ITSELF HAS A HEART-PROTECTIVE EFFECT, PRESUMABLY BY LOWERING LDL CHOLESTEROL (THE "BAD" KIND). THEY SAY THAT ANY TYPE OF
ALCOHOL HELPS: BEER, WINE OR DISTILLED SPIRITS.
OTHERS INSIST THAT THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRA IN RED WINE, AND I'M INCLINED TO
AGREE WITH THEM. CERTAIN CHEMICALS CALLED PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE FOUND IN
GRAPE SKIN GIVE RED WINE ITS COLOR. THEY ALSO PROTECT THE BODY FROM LDL CHOLESTEROL EVEN BETTER THAN POWERFUL VITAMIN E.
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO DRINK RED WINE TO GET THESE COMPOUNDS, THOUGH. THEY
ARE ALSO FOUND IN RED GRAPES, RED GRAPE JUICE AND MANY OTHER FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, INCLUDING BILBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES, GARLIC AND ONIONS.
IF YOU CHOOSE TO GET THE BENEFITS OF THESE COMPOUNDS BY HAVING A COUPLE OF
GLASSES OF RED WINE A DAY, FINE. JUST REMEMBER THAT IMBIBING MORE THAN TWO DRINKS
A DAY DAMAGES THE HEART.
VV HAWTHORN (CRATAEGUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). HAWTHORN HAS A WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DESERVED REPUTATION AS A MILD HEART TONIC. IT'S ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN
TREATING THE HEART FATIGUE KNOWN AS CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. BUT RESEARCH SHOWS
THAT THIS HERB ALSO HELPS PREVENT HEART ATTACK. IT IMPROVES BLOOD CIRCULATION
THROUGH THE HEART BY OPENING (DILATING) THE CORONARY ARTERIES. IT ALSO INCREASES THE
HEART'S ABILITY TO COPE WITH A LOSS OF OXYGEN, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CLOGGED
CORONARY ARTERIES REDUCE THE HEART'S BLOOD SUPPLY.
HAWTHORN ALSO HELPS KEEP THE HEART BEATING PROPERLY AND DECREASES WHAT'S
KNOWN AS PERIPHERAL VASCULAR RESISTANCE. THIS MEANS THAT IT HELPS BLOOD FLOW MORE
EASILY, RELIEVING STRAIN ON THE HEART AND HELPING TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE.
246
HEART DISEASE
IN ONE STUDY, PEOPLE WITH HEART DISEASE WHO TOOK 600 TO 900 MILLIGRAMS OF
HAWTHORN A DAY FOR TWO MONTHS REPORTED THAT THEY FELT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.
HAWTHORN IS A POWERFUL HEART MEDICINE. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE HAWTHORN TO PREVENT HEART ATTACK, YOU SHOULD DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR AND SEE A NATUROPATH TO
GET A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT. NATUROPATHS DO NOT RECOMMEND TAKING THE RAW HERB TO
TREAT HEART DISEASE.
^V PURSLANE (PORTUKTCA OLERACEA). I PROMOTE TASTY, SPINACHLIKE PURSLANE
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY, AND HERE'S A GOOD ONE. THIS EASY-TO-GROW GARDEN VEGETABLE
IS OUR BEST LEAFY SOURCE OF BENEFICIAL COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS.
OMEGA-3'S HELP PREVENT THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER HEART ATTACK. THEY'RE THE
REASON THAT PEOPLE WHO EAT A LOT OF COLD-WATER FISH LIKE SALMON, WHICH IS A PRIME
SOURCE OF THESE OILS, HAVE LOW RATES OF HEART DISEASE.
IN ADDITION, PURSLANE IS EXTREMELY WELL-ENDOWED WITH ANTIOXIDANTS, WHICH
ALSO HELP PREVENT HEART ATTACK AS WELL AS CANCER.
FINALLY, THESE GREENS CONTAIN CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM IN A ONE-TO-ONE RATIO.
I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT CALCIUM IS GOOD FOR THE HEART, BUT CALCIUM IS MOST PROTECTIVE WHEN YOU TAKE IT IN A ONE-TO-ONE COMBINATION WITH MAGNESIUM. THAT'S A
GOOD ARGUMENT FOR EATING LOTS OF FRESH, LEAFY PURSLANE. I EAT IT RAW IN SALADS OR
STEAM IT, JUST LIKE SPINACH.
VV ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). ROSEMARY IS ONE OF THE RICHER
HERBAL SOURCES OF ANTIOXIDANTS, WHICH IS WHY IT WORKS SO WELL AS A FOOD PRESERVATIVE. ITS ANTIOXIDANTS HELP PREVENT THE FATS IN MEAT FROM TURNING RANCID. THEY DO
THE SAME, IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING, FOR YOUR HEART.
ROSEMARY MAKES A PLEASANT-TASTING TEA. YOU CAN ALSO USE GENEROUS AMOUNTS
OF ROSEMARY IN YOUR COOKING.
V CHICORY (CICHORIUM INTYBUS). ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA HERBALIST KATHI
KEVILLE, AUTHOR OF THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR HEALTH AND
HEALING, WHOM I RESPECT HIGHLY, EGYPTIAN RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
CHICORY ROOT HAS TWO HEART BENEFITS. IT SLOWS A RAPID HEARTBEAT, AND IT ALSO HAS A
MILD HEART-STIMULATING EFFECT, SOMEWHAT LIKE THE OFTEN-PRESCRIBED MEDICATION DIGITALIS. AND IT'S GENTLE ENOUGH TO BE SAFE.
SEVERAL COMMERCIAL COFFEE SUBSTITUTES CONTAIN ROASTED CHICORY. IN FRANCE AND
ITALY, THE ROOTS ARE NOT ONLY CONSUMED AS A DRINK BUT ARE ALSO CONSIDERED A VEGETABLE. TRY SOME CHICORY COFFEE SUBSTITUTE AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT. FOLLOW THE
PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V OLIVE (OLEA EUROPEA). WHEN TAKEN DAILY, OLIVE OIL MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST HEART DISEASE. CERTAINLY IT IS PIVOTAL IN THE
HEART-HEALTHY MEDITERRANEAN DIET. IN MEDITERRANEAN POPULATIONS IN WHICH THE
MAIN SOURCE OF FAT IS MONOUNSATURATED OLIVE OIL, HEART ATTACKS ARE RELATIVELY
247
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEA L
RARE, EVEN WHEN TOTAL FAT CONSUMPTION IS FAIRLY HIGH.
IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO, YOU SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING OLIVE OIL THE MAIN
OIL THAT YOU USE IN THE KITCHEN.
V PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). LEAVE THE PAPERY RED SKINS ON YOUR
PEANUTS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE HEART-PROTECTIVE COMPOUNDS CALLED OLIGOMERIC
PROCYANIDINS (OPCS) CAN BE FOUND. OPCS ARE POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS THAT HELP PREVENT NOT ONLY HEART ATTACK BUT ALSO CANCER AND STROKE.
SINCE PLANTS' OPC CONTENT HAS NOT YET BEEN WELL-TABULATED, I CANNOT TELL YOU
WHICH ONES HAVE THE MOST. I LIKE TO GET MY OPCS FROM PEANUT SKINS, RED GRAPES
AND RED WINE.
HEMORRHOIDS
I
N AUGUST OF 1990, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) RULED WHICH
INGREDIENTS IN OVER-THE-COUNTER HEMORRHOID PRODUCTS WERE PERMISSIBLE
AND WHICH WERE BANNED. HEMORRHOID PRODUCTS CONSTITUTE A $150 MILLION INDUSTRY, AND THOSE RULINGS HAD AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS
AVAILABLE AT YOUR LOCAL DRUGSTORE.
PERMISSIBLE PRODUCTS INCLUDED LOCAL ANESTHETICS AND ANALGESICS TO DEAL WITH
THE PAIN OF HEMORRHOIDS; VASOCONSTRICTORS TO TIGHTEN THE DISTENDED VEINS THAT LEAD
TO HEMORRHOIDS; LUBRICANTS TO HELP RELIEVE CONSTIPATION, THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF
HEMORRHOIDS; ASTRINGENTS, WHICH HELP TIGHTEN ANAL TISSUE DISTENDED BY HEMORRHOIDS; AND KERATOLYTICS, WHICH HELP REMOVE EXCESS HEMORRHOIDAL TISSUE. SOME OF
THE PERMISSIBLE PRODUCTS WERE HERBAL OR DERIVED FROM PLANT SOURCES: BENZYL ALCOHOL, AN ANESTHETIC; COCOA BUTTER, A LUBRICANT; WITCH HAZEL WATER, AN ASTRINGENT;
AND MENTHOL, CAMPHOR AND JUNIPER TAR, FOR RELIEF OF PAIN AND ITCHING. THAT'S THE
GOOD NEWS.
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THE FDA ALSO BANNED SEVERAL HERBAL HEMORRHOID TREATMENTS WITH LONG HISTORIES OF USE FOR THIS COMMON AFFLICTION, AMONG THEM GOLDENSEAL, USED FOR CENTURIES AS AN ANAL ANTISEPTIC; MULLEIN, A SOOTHING, ITCH-RELIEVING
HERB; TANNINS, WELL-DOCUMENTED ASTRINGENTS; AND MENTHOL AND CAMPHOR AS COUNTERIRRITANTS, SUBSTANCES THAT PRODUCE MINOR IRRITATION AND THUS RELIEVE OTHER PAIN.
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE FDA APPROVES SOME HERBAL REMEDIES AND NOT OTHERS, I'D
ADVISE YOU TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND. PERSONALLY, I DON'T GIVE MUCH CREDENCE TO THE
FDA'S OPINIONS ABOUT HERBAL REMEDIES. BOTH FOLKLORE AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT THE VARIETY OF USABLE REMEDIES IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE GOVERNMENT
AGENCY ATTESTS.
248
HEMORRHOID S
THE ALL-AMERICAN CONDITION
ESTIMATES VARY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HEMORRHOIDS AFFECT ONE-THIRD OF AMERICANS—SOME 75 MILLION PEOPLE. ALL FOUR PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY HAVE EXPERIENCED
THEM, MORE OFTEN WHEN WE GET AWAY FROM THE HIGH-FIBER DIET THAT WE EAT AT HOME.
HEMORRHOIDS ARE VARICOSE VEINS OF THE ANUS. ANAL VEINS DRAIN BLOOD AWAY
FROM THE AREA. THEY EXPAND (DILATE) DURING DEFECATION AND SHRINK BACK TO
NORMAL SIZE AFTERWARD. HOWEVER, REPEATED STRAINING DURING DEFECATION, WHICH
IS A COMMON RESULT OF CONSTIPATION, CAN INTERFERE WITH THE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF
THESE VEINS. THEY MAY BECOME PERMANENTLY SWOLLEN, CAUSING PAIN AND ITCHING.
IN ADDITION, DEFECATION CAN RUPTURE THE SWOLLEN BLOOD VESSELS, CAUSING
BLEEDING. THIS IS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN, BECAUSE DURING
PREGNANCY, THE DEVELOPING FETUS PLACES PRESSURE ON ALL THE VEINS OF THE LOWER
ABDOMEN.
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH HEMORRHOIDS IS TO PREVENT THEM, AND THE BEST
WAY TO DO THAT IS TO PREVENT CONSTIPATION. YOU'LL FIND SEVERAL HERBS THAT ARE GOOD
FOR RELIEVING CHRONIC CONSTIPATION MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER. (FOR ADDITIONAL
DETAILS, SEE PAGE 140.)
A REGULAR KIND OR PERSON
BASICALLY, STAYING REGULAR BOILS DOWN TO EATING A HIGH-FIBER DIET, WITH LOTS OF
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, AND DRINKING PLENTY OF NONALCOHOLIC FLUIDS. I DARESAY THAT
ANYONE WHO REGULARLY EATS FIVE FIBROUS FRUITS AND FIVE FIBROUS VEGGIES A DAY WILL
NOT SUFFER FROM CONSTIPATION. IN OTHER WORDS, A PREVENTIVE OUNCE OF CARROTS OR
APPLES—AND OF COURSE, PRUNES—IS WORTH A POUND OF BUCKTHORN, AN HERBAL LAXATIVE, TAKEN LATER.
ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO USE AN INTERNAL LUBRICANT THAT ALLOWS STOOL TO PASS
MORE EASILY. MINERAL OIL IS THE PHARMACEUTICAL APPROACH, BUT YOU MIGHT TRY
OLIVE OR LINSEED OIL INSTEAD.
FINALLY, BEYOND PREVENTING CONSTIPATION, I'LL OFFER A FEW MORE LIFESTYLE SUGGESTIONS. NEVER IGNORE "THE URGE" TO GO. WHEN SITTING ON THE TOILET, DON'T BEAR
DOWN; TRY TO RELAX. STRAINING LEADS TO HEMORRHOIDS. DON'T SIT ON THE TOILET ANY
LONGER THAN NECESSARY. ADOPT MORE OF A SQUATTING POSITION AND RAISE YOUR FEET
ON A SMALL STOOL. THIS HELPS MANY PEOPLE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HEMORRHOIDS
IF YOU DEVELOP HEMORRHOIDS, HERE ARE SOME HERBS TO TRY.
W COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE). COMFREY IS RICH IN ALLANTOIN, A
249
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WOUND-HEALING CHEMICAL THAT IS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, STIMULATES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
AND HASTENS THE FORMATION OF NEW SKIN. YOU CAN MOISTEN POWDERED COMFREY WITH
VEGETABLE OIL AND APPLY THE PASTE. OR YOU CAN POUND THE LEAF TO SOFTEN THE FUZZY
HAIRS IT'S COVERED WITH AND APPLY THE LEAF ITSELF, TOPICALLY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT WASHING IT OFF, AS THE RESIDUE WILL COME OFF THE NEXT TIME YOU SHOWER.
*M| W PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS
SPECIES). PLANTAIN HAS A STRONG FOLK
REPUTATION AS A HEMORRHOID REMEDY.
THIS HERB CONTAINS ALLANTOIN, THE SAME
SOOTHING COMPOUND FOUND IN COMFREY.
IF I WERE CAUGHT IN THE BUSH WITH A HEMORRHOID AND WITHOUT MY TUCKS, I'D
CREATE A POULTICE AND APPLY IT TO THE AFFLICTED AREA.
VV PSYLLIUM (PLANTAGO OVATA).
IN ONE STUDY, 51 PEOPLE WITH HEMORRHOIDS RECEIVED A PSYLLIUM PREPARATION.
MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS (84 PERCENT)
REPORTED IMPROVEMENT—LESS PAIN,
ITCHING, BLEEDING AND DISCOMFORT ON
DEFECATION. COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN
HERBAL ADVISORY PANEL, RECOMMENDS
TAKING ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO TEN TEASPOONS OF PSYLLIUM SEEDS A DAY FOR CONSTIPATION. IT'S EASY TO GET THAT MUCH BY
USING A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT SUCH AS
METAMUCIL, WHICH IS MADE WITH PSYLLIUM
SEEDS. SIMPLY FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON
THE PACKAGE.
PSYLLIUM WORKS BY ABSORBING WATER
IN THE GUT AND SWELLING CONSIDERABLY,
WHICH ADDS BULK TO STOOL AND TRIGGERS
THE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS WE EXPERIENCE
"THE URGE." IF YOU USE PSYLLIUM,
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
JUST FOR THE RECORD, HERE'S AN HERB YOU DON'T
WANT TO USE BUT MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECAUSE OF ITS NAME—PILEWORT (RANUNCULUS
JICAHA). PILES IS AN OLD-FASHIONED WORD FOR
HEMORRHOIDS, AND YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH
GUESS THAT AN HERB WITH THAT NAME WOULD BE
GOOD FOR HEMORRHOIDS. IN FACT, THIS HERB HAS
AN INTERESTING HISTORY.
EARLY HERBALISTS BELIEVED IT WAS
USEFUL BECAUSE THEY SUBSCRIBED TO THE
DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES, THE MEDIEVAL IDEA
THAT A PLANT'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE HINTED
AT ITS MEDICINAL USE. PILEWORT TUBERS WERE
THOUGHT TO RESEMBLE HEMORRHOIDS.
THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES OBVIOUSLY
HAS PROBLEMS, BUT PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE
KEPT USING PILEWORT FOR HEMORRHOIDS FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS IF IT DIDN'T HELP, AT
LEAST A LITTLE.
ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY
ABOUT THIS HERB, RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D.,
THE DEAN OF GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS
AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE, CONCLUDES: "IN MY OWN TRIALS AND OBSERVATIONS, PILEWORT HAS FAILED COMPLETELY, BOTH
INTERNALLY AND AS AN OINTMENT." BUT NOTED
BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR
OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, WHOM I RESPECT,
IS MORE POSITIVE, SAYING THAT IT HELPS. SINCE
MANY SPECIES OF RANUNCULUS CAN CAUSE
BLISTERS, AND THE BENEFITS ARE ELUSIVE,
YOU'RE PROBABLY WELL-ADVISED TO AVOID IT.
AS
MAKE SURE YOU DRINK ENOUGH FLUIDS.
YOU SHOULD GET AT LEAST EIGHT (EIGHTOUNCE) GLASSES OF WATER OR JUICE A DAY.
AND WATCH HOW YOU REACT TO THIS HERB IF
YOU HAVE ALLERGIES. IF ALLERGIC SYMP250
HEMORRHOIDS
TOMS DEVELOP AFTER YOU TAKE IT ONCE, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
W WITCH HAZEL (HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA). FOR A LONG TIME, I THOUGHT THE
H IN PREPARATION H STOOD FOR HAMAMELIS. THIS IS THE LATIN NAME FOR WITCH HAZEL,
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN THE POPULAR PREPARATION H CLEANSING PADS. (I GUESS I
SHOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT THAT THE H ACTUALLY STANDS FOR HEMORRHOIDS.) WITCH HAZEL
IS ALSO THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN TUCKS, THE COMMERCIAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT
OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR HEMORRHOIDS.
WITCH HAZEL IS A SOOTHING, COOLING ASTRINGENT THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE HEMORRHOIDAL PAIN AND ITCHING. BUT YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND EXTRA FOR A BRAND
NAME. SIMPLY MAKE A COMPRESS USING WITCH HAZEL, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT PHARMACIES FOR A MUCH LOWER PRICE. JUST TUCK A FRESH COMPRESS IN PLACE WHENEVER
YOU FEEL THE NEED FOR A LITTLE SOOTHING. THEN FORGET IT'S THERE AND GO ABOUT YOUR
BUSINESS.
V ALOE {ALOE VERA)* ALOE GEL IS ASTRINGENT AND HELPS HEAL WOUNDS. YOU
MIGHT TRY APPLYING IT TOPICALLY TO THE ANAL AREA. WHEN INGESTED, ALOE JUICE IS LAXATIVE. INDIA'S AYURVEDIC PHYSICIANS SUGGEST DRINKING A HALF-CUP OF ALOE JUICE THREE
TIMES A DAY UNTIL HEMORRHOID FLARE-UPS HAVE CLEARED. YOU CAN BUY ALOE JUICE AT
MOST HEALTH FOOD STORES. (DON'T TRY TO PREPARE YOUR OWN.
THE INNER PART OF THE LEAF ITSELF IS SUCH A POWERFUL LAXATIVE THAT JUICING THAT COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS.)
GERMAN PHYSICIANS ECHO THE AYURVEDICS. COMMISSION E SUGGESTS ALOE AS A STOOL SOFTENER FOR THOSE
WITH HEMORRHOIDS OR ANAL FISSURES OR AFTER
ANAL OR RECTAL SURGERY. THE SUGGESTED
DOSE IS 0.05 TO 0.2 GRAM OF POWDERED
ALOES, ALSO KNOWN AS DRY EXTRACT. THIS REALLY ISN'T VERY MUCH POWDER—A PINCH
THROWN INTO A CUP OF TEA WOULD DO IT. (THIS
REMEDY MAY TURN THE URINE RED.)
I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO APPLY THE YELLOW
GEL FROM A KITCHEN ALOE LEAF TO A HEMORRHOID.
I ALSO MIGHT ADD A LITTLE GEL (A SPOONFUL OR
TWO) TO SOME PRUNE JUICE.
V BUTCHER'S BROOM (RUSCUS ACULEATUS). THIS WOODY HERB HAS A LONG HISTORY
AS A TREATMENT FOR VENOUS PROBLEMS LIKE HEMORRHOIDS AND VARICOSE VEINS. THE PLANT CONTAINS CHEMICALS CALLED RUSCOGENINS, WHICH
HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND VASOCONSTRICTING
BUTCHER'S BROOM
YOU CAN GET THIS HERB IN THE FORM
OF POWDERED ROOT OR AS A TINCTURE.
251
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
PROPERTIES. I'D TRY FIVE ROUNDED TEASPOONS OF ROOT IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR
INTERNAL CONSUMPTION; YOU CAN SWEETEN THE TEA WITH HONEY. AND FOR TOPICAL APPLICATION, I'D USE A TINCTURE OF THE HERB MADE WITH ALCOHOL.
V HORSE CHESTNUT (AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM). THE BARK OF THIS TREE
CONTAINS SEVERAL CHEMICALS THAT HELP TREAT HEMORRHOIDS. AESCULIN AND AESCIN
STRENGTHEN BLOOD VESSEL WALLS, REDUCING THE RISK OF FURTHER HEMORRHOIDS. OTHER
CHEMICALS IN THIS HERB HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY BENEFITS.
SOME EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT HORSE CHESTNUT DOES HELP RELIEVE
HEMORRHOID SYMPTOMS. ABOUT 5 TO 10 PERCENT OF THE ACTIVE CHEMICALS ARE
ABSORBED IF YOU TAKE THIS HERB ORALLY. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM: THE HERB CONTAINS TANNINS THAT TEND TO CONTRIBUTE TO CONSTIPATION IF YOU DRINK IT. BUT YOU CAN
USE A TEA MADE FROM THE HERB TO APPLY TO THE HEMORRHOIDS OR MAKE A POULTICE BY
MOISTENING POWDERED BARK OR SEEDS AND APPLY THE RESULTING PASTE DIRECDY.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST ADDING ONE OR TWO
DROPS OF ANY NUMBER OF HERBAL ESSENTIAL OILS TO VEGETABLE OIL, THEN APPLYING THE
OINTMENT TO THE ANAL AREA. I'D SUGGEST USING AN EMOLLIENT OIL SUCH AS ALMOND AS A
BASE. FOR ESSENTIAL OILS, I'D TRY CYPRESS, JUNIPER, LAVENDER, LEMON OR ROSEMARY. (REMEMBER THOUGH, NOT TO INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS, AS EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.)
V ASSORTED HERBS. I'LL ALSO SHARE TWO HEMORRHOID TREATMENTS RECOMMENDED BY HERBALISTS I TRUST, BOTH AUTHORS OF GOOD BOOKS ON HERBAL MEDICINE.
HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC
VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, SUGGESTS MAKINGTEA FOR TOPICAL APPLICATION USING ALUMROOT (ASTRINGENT), GOLDENSEAL (VASOCONSTRICTING), MULLEIN (SOOTHING), SLIPPERY ELM BARK (SOOTHING) AND WITCH HAZEL
(ASTRINGENT). YOU CAN USE ANY AMOUNT OF THESE INGREDIENTS.
DAVID HOFFMANN, NOTED BRITISH HERBALIST AND AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, RECOMMENDS USING A TOPICAL SALVE MADE FROM CALENDULA, CAMOMILE,
YARROW, PLANTAIN AND ST.-JOHN'S-WORT AFTER EVERY BOWEL MOVEMENT. TRY MIXING
ONE TEASPOON OF EACH HERB IN POWDERED FORM WITH ENOUGH EMOLLIENT OIL
(ALMOND) TO FORM A PASTE, THEN APPLY.
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
S
EVERAL YEARS AGO I SPENT THREE VERY LONG DAYS FILMING WHAT I HOPED
WOULD BE MY FIRST VIDEO ABOUT HEALTH FOOD. BUT AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT,
THE TIME WAS WASTED BECAUSE AN EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION RUINED THE TAPE.
252
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
CORRECTION: THE TIME WASN'T REALLY WASTED, BECAUSE I GOT TO KNOW THE CAMERAMAN. HE HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (HYPERTENSION), AND I SUGGESTED SOME NATURAL THERAPIES. AFTER WE PARTED COMPANY, I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM FOR QUITE A
WHILE, BUT LATER HE WROTE ME: "I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING WHAT YOU PREACHED FOR
OVER A YEAR NOW. I ELIMINATED ALCOHOL, PORK AND BEEF, NOW EAT MORE PLANT FOODS
AND HERBS AND TAKE SUPPLEMENTS: BETA-CAROTENE, VITAMIN C, VITAMIN E, B COMPLEX. A RECENT PHYSICAL WAS VERY REVEALING. MY DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE WAS
DOWN ALMOST 30 PERCENT. MY CHOLESTEROL DROPPED FROM 192 TO 159."
HEARTS WAKIN G TOO HARD.
HYPERTENSION IS GENERALLY DENNED AS A BLOOD PRESSURE GREATER THAN 140/90.
THE FIRST NUMBER (SYSTOLIC) IS THE FORCE THAT BLOOD EXERTS ON THE ARTERY WALLS
WHEN THE HEART IS PUMPING. THE SECOND NUMBER (DIASTOLIC) IS THE RESIDUAL FORCE
THAT REMAINS WHEN THE HEART RELAXES BETWEEN BEATS. ANY BLOOD PRESSURE
READING BELOW "HIGH"—SAY, A BORDERLINE 138/0¾—IS SAFER, BUT YOU SHOULD STILL
TRY GETTING IT DOWN CLOSER TO WHAT'S CONSIDERED NORMAL, 120/80. THAT'S BECAUSE
ANY ELEVATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE RAISES YOUR RISK FOR HEART ATTACK AND STROKE.
ABOUT 50 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH IS OFTEN
CALLED THE SILENT KILLER. WHILE THE CONDITION ITSELF CAUSES NO SYMPTOMS, IT SETS
THE STAGE FOR A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, DOCTORS AND OTHER
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HAVE MADE A BIG PUSH TO DETECT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND
TREAT IT MORE AGGRESSIVELY, AND THE RATE OF HEART ATTACK HAS INDEED GONE DOWN.
BUT THE PROBLEM, IN MY OPINION, IS THAT DOCTORS ARE TOO QUICK TO TREAT THIS CONDITION WITH SYNTHETIC DRUGS. ABOUT HALF OF THE PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE HAVE BORDERLINE TO MILDLY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THERE'S PLENTY OF SOLID
EVIDENCE THAT FOR THEM, DIET AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES, INCLUDING REGULAR EXERCISE,
STRESS MANAGEMENT AND SELF-MONITORING WITH A HOME BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICE,
WORK JUST AS WELL AS DRUGS, WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS.
DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ALL TEND TO PROVIDE A SENSE OF CONTROL THAT IN
ITSELF MAY BE BENEFICIAL. BUT DON'T EXPECT THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO ENCOURAGE
THE NATURAL WAY. IT WOULD CUT INTO THE $2.5 BILLION-A-YEAR MARKET FOR ANTIHYPERTEN-
;
 SIVE MEDICATION.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
EATING HEARTY VEGETABLE SOUPS ON A REGULAR BASIS CAN DO MORE THAN HELP
NORMALIZE BLOOD PRESSURE AND PREVENT HEART DISEASE. IT CAN ALSO HELP PREVENT
1
 CANCER, OBESITY, DIABETES AND CONSTIPATION. VEGETABLE SOUP IS SO GOOD FOR HEALTH
) THAT I DON'T EVEN CALL IT MINESTRONE ANYMORE, BUT RATHER MEDISTRONE.
}
 WHAT SHOULD YOU PUT IN YOUR MEDISTRONE SOUP? YOU CAN USE JUST ABOUT ANY
/253
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VEGETABLES, ESPECIALLY THE ONES MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER.
THERE ARE ALSO ANY NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT THOSE IN A SOUP. THEY MAKE RATHER NICE TEAS.
W V CELERY (APIUM GRAVEOLENS). CELERY HAS LONG BEEN RECOMMENDED IN
TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE FOR LOWERING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE BEARS THIS OUT. IN ONE STUDY, INJECTING LABORATORY ANIMALS WITH CELERY EXTRACT SIGNIFICANDY LOWERED THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE. IN HUMANS, EATING AS FEW AS FOUR
CELERY STALKS HAS DONE THE SAME.
W V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). THIS WONDER HERB NOT ONLY HELPS NORMALIZE
BLOOD PRESSURE, IT ALSO REDUCES CHOLESTEROL. IN A SCIENTIFICALLY RIGOROUS STUDY,
PEOPLE WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE WERE GIVEN ABOUT ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC A DAY FOR 12
WEEKS. AFTERWARD THEY EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
"WE NOW KNOW THAT GARLIC CAN REDUCE HYPERTENSION, EVEN IN QUANTITIES AS
SMALL AS A HALF-OUNCE PER WEEK," SAYS VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR
EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY
IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA. A HALF-OUNCE PER WEEK WORKS OUT TO ABOUT ONE CLOVE
A DAY. IF YOU COOK WITH GARLIC AND USE IT IN YOUR SALADS, GETTING THAT MUCH
SHOULD BE A SNAP. IF YOU HAVEN'T YET DEVELOPED A TASTE FOR IT, YOU CAN TAKE GARLIC
IN CAPSULE FORM. WITH SO MANY HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HERB, I'D
RECOMMEND FINDING MANY WAYS TO ENJOY IT IN YOUR FOOD.
V \ HAWTHORN {CRATAEGUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). HAWTHORN EXTRACT CAN
WIDEN (DILATE) BLOOD VESSELS, ESPECIALLY THE CORONARY ARTERIES, ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED IN THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED
NEWSLETTER. HAWTHORN HAS BEEN USED AS A HEART TONIC FOR CENTURIES.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS POWERFUL HEART MEDICINE, DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR
DOCTOR. YOU CAN TRY A TEA MADE WITH ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER AND DRINK UP TO TWO CUPS A DAY.
VV KUDZU (PUERARIA LOB AT A). CHINESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THIS WEEDY
VINE HELPS NORMALIZE BLOOD PRESSURE. IN ONE STUDY, A TEA CONTAINING ABOUT EIGHT
TEASPOONS OF KUDZU ROOT WAS GIVEN DAILY TO 52 PEOPLE FOR TWO TO EIGHT WEEKS. IN 17
PEOPLE, BLOOD PRESSURE DECLINED MARKEDLY. THIRTY OTHERS SHOWED SOME BENEFIT.
KUDZU CONTAINS A CHEMICAL (PUERARIN) THAT HAS DECREASED BLOOD PRESSURE
BY 15 PERCENT IN LABORATORY ANIMALS. WITH 100 TIMES THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY
OF VITAMIN E, PUERARIN ALSO HELPS PREVENT HEART DISEASE AND CANCER. (ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT NEUTRALIZE CELL-DAMAGING OXYGEN MOLECULES KNOWN
AS FREE RADICALS.)
W ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). IN ONE STUDY, TWO TO THREE TABLESPOONS OF ONION
ESSENTIAL OIL A DAY LOWERED BLOOD PRESSURE IN 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH MODERATE
254
HIG H BLOO D PRESSURE
HYPERTENSION. THEIR SYSTOLIC LEVELS FELL AN AVERAGE OF 25 POINTS AND THEIR DIASTOLIC
READINGS FELL 15 POINTS.
THE BAD NEWS IS THAT YOU CAN'T GET THIS OIL, AND YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO EAT
ENOUGH ONIONS TO GET THIS MUCH OF AN EFFECT. IN MY CASE, FD HAVE TO INGEST THREE
TIMES MY BODY WEIGHT IN ONIONS. NO THANKS. BUT I DO THINK THAT ONIONS HAVE
ENOUGH GOING FOR THEM THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY ADD MORE OF THEM TO YOUR DIET
TO HELP LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE.
VV TOMATO (LYCOPERSICON LYCOPERSIEUM), A TYPICAL MINESTRONE HAS A
TOMATO BASE. THAT'S ALSO PERFECT FOR MEDISTRONE SOUP, BECAUSE TOMATOES ARE HIGH IN
GAMMA-AMINO BUTYRIC ACID (GABA), A COMPOUND THAT CAN HELP BRING DOWN BLOOD
PRESSURE. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, TOMATOES ALSO
CONTAIN SIX OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT DO THE SAME THING.
V BROCCOLI (BRASSICA OLERACEA). THIS
VEGETABLE HAS AT LEAST SIX CHEMICALS THAT REDUCE
BLOOD PRESSURE.
V CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). ACCORDING TO
MY DATABASE, CARROTS CONTAIN EIGHT COMPOUNDS THAT
LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE.
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND
OTHER FOODS CONTAINING MAGNESIUM. MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE. MANY AMERICANS ARE DEFICIENT IN THIS
MINERAL AND DON'T KNOW IT. A 1994 GALLUP POLL
SHOWED THAT ABOUT 72 PERCENT OF THOSE SURVEYED REPORTED INADEQUATE MAGNESIUM INTAKE.
TO GET MAGNESIUM, TURN TO LEAFY GREENS,
LEGUMES AND WHOLE GRAINS. PURSLANE, POPPY SEEDS
AND STRING BEANS ARE THE BEST DIETARY SOURCES, ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE. NUTRITIONISTS SUGGEST THAT
A DAILY SUPPLEMENT OF 400 MILLIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM MAY ALSO HELP, BUT I GENERALLY RECOMMEND
GETTING NUTRIENTS FROM FOODS.
V SAFFRON (CROCUS SATIVIIS). THIS EXPENSIVE HERB CONTAINS A BLOOD PRESSURE—LOWERING
CHEMICAL CALLED CROCETIN. SOME AUTHORITIES EVEN
SPECULATE THAT THE LOW INCIDENCE OF HEART DISEASE IN
SPAIN IS DUE TO THAT NATION'S HIGH SAFFRON CONSUMPTION. YOU CAN USE SAMRM IN YOUR COOKING OR MAKE A
TEA WITH IT.
SAFFRON IS A RARE SPICE
PRODUCED BY THE STIGMA
OF SAFFRON FLOWERS; THE
CENTERS OF ABOUT 75,000
FLOWERS ARE REQUIRED TO
MAKE A POUND OF SPICE.

CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V VALERIAN (VALERIANA OFFICINALIS). EARLIER IN THIS CHAPTER I MENTIONED
THAT GAMMA-AMINO BUTYRIC ACID HELPS CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE. WELL, THE HERB VALERIAN CONTAINS A CHEMICAL CALLED VALERENIC ACID THAT INHIBITS AN ENZYME THAT
BREAKS DOWN GABA. SO INGESTING SOMETHING CONTAINING VALERENIC ACID WOULD, IN
EFFECT, ENSURE HIGHER LEVELS OF GABA AND LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE.
VALERIAN IS ALSO A TRANQUILIZER/SEDATIVE, WHICH ALSO HELPS REDUCE BLOOD
PRESSURE.
V ASSORTED SPICES. AS FOR SPICES THAT YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR MEDISTRONE,
FENNEL CONTAINS AT LEAST TEN COMPOUNDS THAT LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE, OREGANO HAS
SEVEN, AND BLACK PEPPER, BASIL AND TARRAGON EACH HAVE SIX.
HIGFH CHOLESTEROL
T
HE CHOLESTEROL STORY BEGAN IN 1951, WHEN THE PENTAGON SENT PATHOLOGISTS TO KOREA TO STUDY THE BODIES OF SERVICEMEN LOST IN THE WAR THERE.
THE PATHOLOGISTS AUTOPSIED SOME 2,000 SOLDIERS.
ALTHOUGH ALMOST NO ONE UNDER 35 DIES OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE, MORE
THAN 75 PERCENT OF THE SOLDIERS, AVERAGE AGE 21, HAD YELLOW DEPOSITS OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUE ON THEIR ARTERY WALLS. THESE ARTERY-CLOGGING DEPOSITS, DOCTORS
HAD WRONGLY ASSUMED, WERE ONLY PREVALENT IN MUCH OLDER MEN. THE REPORTS OF
THE ARMY PATHOLOGISTS SHOCKED THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. BEFORE THE KOREA AUTOPSIES, DOCTORS DIDN'T REALIZE HOW EARLY THE PROCESS OF HEART DISEASE BEGINS.
NOT LONG AFTERWARD, A WAXY SUBSTANCE IN THE BLOOD—CHOLESTEROL—WAS
IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE BUILDUP OF PLAQUE AND TO HEART DISEASE
RISK. MORE RECENDY, SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT FOR EVERY 1 PERCENT DROP IN
CHOLESTEROL LEVELS, THERE IS A 2 PERCENT DECREASE IN HEART ATTACK RISK.
UNDERSTANDING THE NUMBERS
THE TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVEL OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS HIGHER THAN 200 MILLIGRAMS PER DECILITER (MG/DL) OF BLOOD. BECAUSE HEART ATTACK RISK RISES SHARPLY
ABOVE THAT LEVEL, THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION URGES EVERYONE TO TAKE MEASURES TO REDUCE CHOLESTEROL IF IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR THAT HIGH.
HOW FAR BELOW 200 SHOULD YOU GO TO FEEL THAT YOUR RISK IS SIGNIFICANDY LESS?
THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR, BUT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT VERY LOW CHOLESTEROL LEVELS,
256
HIG H CHOLESTERO L
BELOW 150 OR SO, INCREASE RISK OF DEATH FROM OTHER CAUSES, INCLUDING LIVER
CANCER, LUNG DISEASE AND CERTAIN KINDS OF STROKE. MY REACTION IS THAT PEOPLE
SHOULD STRIVE FOR A CHOLESTEROL RANGE OF 170 TO 190.
TO MAKE MATTERS MORE COMPLICATED, THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF CHOLESTEROL—
LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS (LDL), WHICH INCREASE RISK OF HEART ATTACK, AND HIGHDENSITY LIPOPROTEINS (HDL), WHICH ACTUALLY REDUCE IT. YOU WANT TO GET YOUR TOTAL
CHOLESTEROL DOWN BELOW 190. BUT IF YOU HAVE HIGH CHOLESTEROL, YOUR DOCTOR MAY
FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON YOUR LDL LEVELS AND HAVE YOU WORK TO REDUCE THOSE, SINCE
THE "BAD" KIND IS MOST CLEARLY LINKED TO HEART DISEASE.
AN ESTIMATED 25 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS HIGH
ENOUGH TO PLACE THEM AT RISK FOR HEART ATTACK, AND 10 PERCENT HAVE LEVELS SO
HIGH THAT DOCTORS ARE QUICK TO PRESCRIBE DRUG TREATMENTS. BUT THEY'RE FAR LESS
LIKELY TO TELL YOU THE GREEN PHARMACY WAYS TO REDUCE YOUR HEART DISEASE RISK.
FIBER POWER
ANY AND PROBABLY ALL PLANT FIBERS CAN LOWER CHOLESTEROL. THAT MEANS EATING
A DIET THAT INCLUDES LOTS OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND WHOLE GRAINS, HOPEFULLY ONE
WITH A MINIMUM OF FATS.
IN ONE STUDY, A HIGH-FIBER SUPPLEMENT (FIBERCEL, WHICH IS STILL BEING TESTED
AND NOT AVAILABLE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE) WAS ADDED TO THE DIETS OF LABORATORY
HAMSTERS, ENOUGH TO CONSTITUTE 5 PERCENT OF THEIR DAILY CALORIE INTAKE. THE
FIBERCEL LOWERED THEIR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL BY 42 PERCENT AND THEIR "BAD" LDL
CHOLESTEROL BY 69 PERCENT. BENEFICIAL HDL INCREASED 16 PERCENT.
OAT BRAN HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF PUBLICITY AS A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER, BUT IT'S JUST
ONE OF MANY HIGH-FIBER FOODS. FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND GRAINS HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS. IN FACT, OAT BRAN IS FAR FROM THE BEST FIBER FOR LOWERING CHOLESTEROL. HAMSTERS FED A DIET WITH 5 PERCENT OAT BRAN SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL
AND LDL OF ONLY 19 AND 29 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, A WEAK SHOWING COMPARED
WITH THAT OBTAINED WITH FIBERCEL.
THE COMPONENTS OF OAT BRAN THAT LOWER CHOLESTEROL ARE BETA-GLUCANS. BUT
HERE AGAIN, OAT BRAN IS NOT THE RICHEST SOURCE. BARLEY CONTAINS UP TO THREE TIMES
MORE BETA-GLUCANS THAN OATS, AND BEANS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT SOURCES.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OFTEN IT ISN'T NECESSARY TO RESORT TO DRUGS. THERE ARE
PLENTY OF FOODS AND HERBS THAT CAN HELP BRING CHOLESTEROL LEVELS DOWN.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HIGH CHOLESTEROL
ALONG WITH GETTING ADEQUATE FIBER FROM THE FOODS YOU EAT, THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL FOODS AND HERBS THAT CAN PROVE HELPFUL.
257
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
^ V CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA) AND OTHE R FOODS CONTAINING PECTIN.
SCOTTISH STUDIES SHOWED THAT OVER A PERIOD OF THREE WEEKS, A DAILY SNACK OF TWO
CARROTS LOWERED CHOLESTEROL LEVELS BY 10 TO 20 PERCENT IN STUDY PARTICIPANTS. CARROTS ARE HIGH IN THE FIBER PECTIN. OTHER GOOD SOURCES OF PECTIN INCLUDE APPLES AND
THE WHITE INNER LAYER OF CITRUS RINDS. ENJOY THESE FOODS ON A DAILY BASIS. (YES, IF
YOU'RE EATING AN ORANGE, NIBBLE ON A LITTLE OF THE WHITE STUFF.)
I KNOW THAT JUICING IS REALLY BIG THESE DAYS, SO I'D LIKE TO OFFER A LITTLE ADVICE. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THESE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN BEVERAGE FORM, FINE. BUT
DON'T USE A JUICER ON THEM IF YOU WANT TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THEIR PECTIN CONTENT. JUST WHIR THEM IN A BLENDER INSTEAD. IF YOU USE A JUICER, YOU EXTRACT MOST
OF THE FIBER, AND ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING PECTIN REMAINS.
YOU CAN ALSO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS. UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA SCIENTISTS REPORTED
THAT THREE TABLESPOONS OF GRAPEFRUIT PECTIN DAILY, TAKEN IN CAPSULES OR AS A FOOD
ADDITIVE, CAN LOWER CHOLESTEROL BY ABOUT 8 PERCENT. IF YOU GO THE SUPPLEMENT
ROUTE, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THIS TYPE OF FIBER INTERFERES WITH THE
UPTAKE OF CERTAIN IMPORTANT NUTRIENTS, INCLUDING BETA-CAROTENE, BORON, CALCIUM,
COPPER, IRON AND ZINC. THIS IS LESS OF A PROBLEM WHEN YOU CONSUME THE WHOLE
PLANT, BECAUSE THE PLANT ITSELF SUPPLIES EXTRA NUTRIENTS. BUT IF YOU TAKE PECTIN
CAPSULES, REMEMBER TO EAT YOUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT A LATER MEAL TO MAKE
SURE YOU DON'T TRIGGER ANY DEFICIENCIES.
W AVOCADO (PERSEA AMERICANA). AVOCADO IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST-FAT
FRUITS, SO PEOPLE WITH HEART DISEASE OFTEN AVOID IT. BUT ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN THE
LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER, AVOCADO CAN HELP
REDUCE CHOLESTEROL. IN ONE STUDY, WOMEN WERE GIVEN A CHOICE OF A DIET HIGH IN
MONOUNSATURATED FATS (OLIVE OIL) WITH AVOCADO OR A DIET RICH IN COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES (STARCHES AND SUGARS.) AFTER SIX WEEKS, THOSE ON THE OLIVE OIL-AVOCADO DIET
SHOWED AN 8.2 PERCENT REDUCTION IN CHOLESTEROL.
I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT YOU SHOULD CUT BACK ON COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES,
WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO A HEALTHY DIET, BUT I AM SUGGESTING THAT YOU ENJOY AN
OCCASIONAL AVOCADO. IT CONTAINS SOME UNIQUE CHEMICALS THAT YOU MAY NOT BE
GETTING ELSEWHERE.
VV BEANS (PHASEOHIS, VARIOUS SPECIES). BEANS ARE HIGH IN FIBER AND LOW
IN FAT—JUST THE TICKET FOR LOWERING CHOLESTEROL. AND THEY CONTAIN LECITHIN, A NUTRIENT THAT ALSO HELPS CUT CHOLESTEROL. ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT A CUP AND A HALF OF
DRIED LENTILS OR KIDNEY BEANS A DAY, ABOUT THE AMOUNT IN A BOWL OF BEAN SOUP, CAN
LOWER TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS BY 19 PERCENT.
W CELERY {APUUN GRAVEOLENS). IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS FED LABORATORY ANIMALS A HIGH-FAT DIET FOR EIGHT WEEKS, WHICH RAISED THEIR CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. THEN
258
HIG H CHOLESTERO L
THEY GAVE SOME OF THEM CELERY JUICE. THE JUICE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AND LDL LEVELS IN THE ANIMALS. IT ISN'T CLEAR WHETHER EATING CELERY WOULD HELP
REDUCE CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN HUMANS, BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN'T HURT TO INCLUDE MORE OF
THIS DELICIOUS VEGETABLE IN YOUR DIET.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A. CEPA). MANY STUDIES SHOW
THAT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC A DAY (OR HALF AN ONION) LOWERS TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS BY 10 TO 15 PERCENT IN MOST PEOPLE. IN ONE STUDY, PEOPLE GIVEN 800
MILLIGRAMS (ABOUT ONE CLOVE) OF GARLIC DAILY EXPERIENCED LOWER CHOLESTEROL LEVELS AS
WELL AS LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE. GARLIC IS AN APPROVED REMEDY IN EUROPE FOR CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY HIGH CHOLESTEROL.
IN ANOTHER STUDY, TWO TO THREE TABLESPOONS OF ONION OIL A DAY HELPED TO
LOWER CHOLESTEROL IN ABOUT HALF OF PEOPLE WITH MODERATELY HIGH CHOLESTEROL.
THEIR BLOOD CHOLESTEROL LEVELS FELL 7 TO 33 PERCENT WHILE THEY WERE TAKING THE
ONION OIL.
IT SOUNDS TO ME AS IF IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE GENEROUS AMOUNTS
OF BOTH OF THESE TASTY HERBS IN YOUR DAILY DIET.
VV GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT GINGER HELPS
LOWER CHOLESTEROL. WHY NOT ADD SOME GINGER TO SPICE UP OTHER CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING
FOODS?
V FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). THIS HERB IS RICH IN A
SOOTHING FIBER CALLED MUCILAGE. ITS CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH ANIMALS AND HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED
IN HUMANS.
V NUTS. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT PEOPLE WITH HIGH CHOLESTEROL SHOULD AVOID
HIGH-FAT NUTS, BUT A STUDY OF MORE THAN 25,000 AMERICANS SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO
EAT THE MOST NUTS ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE OBESE. THESE SUBJECTS WERE ALL HEALTHY,
SO I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND NUTS TO THOSE WITH HEART DISEASE OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
BUT FOR REASONABLY HEALTHY FOLKS, NUTS DON'T SEEM TO DO MUCH HARM AND ARE BETTER
THAN TOO MUCH MEAT.
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE NUTS HELP PRODUCE FEELINGS OF SATIETY. WALNUTS, FOR EXAMPLE, CONTAIN THE NEUROTRANSMITTER SEROTONIN, WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE SENSATION OF SATIETY.
HIGH NUT CONSUMPTION, BY THE WAY, WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER INCIDENCE OF FATAL AND NONFATAL HEART ATTACKS. THIS SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ANYONE
WHO IS AT RISK BECAUSE OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
V SAFFLOWER (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS). ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT SWITCHING
FROM OTHER OILS TO SAFFLOWER OIL FOR EIGHT WEEKS REDUCED TOTAL SERUM CHOLESTEROL
LEVELS BY 9 TO 15 PERCENT AND LDL CHOLESTEROL BY 12 TO 20 PERCENT.
V SESAME (SESAMUM INDIE URN). ALL PLANTS CONTAIN PHYTOSTEROLS, COM259
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
DINING LOR LOW CHOLESTEROL
THERE ARE MANY, MANY FOODS AND HERBS THAT LOWER CHOLESTEROL. WHY NOT MIX THEM ALL
TO CREATE A TASTY, HEALTHY DIET THAT GETS THOSE NUMBERS DOWN WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO
BE? HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS.
FOR BREAKFAST
• ORANGE, GRAPEFRUIT, APPLE AND CARROT WHIRRED IN A BLENDER INSTEAD OF PLAIN
ORANGE JUICE
• WHOLE-GRAIN MUFFINS
• FRESH FRUIT AS AVAILABLE
• OATMEAL WITH A TOUCH OF SAFFLOWER OIL (NO BUTTER OR MARGARINE)
FOR LUNCH
• CHOLESTEROL-CUTTING SOUP MADE WITH BEANS, BARLEY, ONIONS, CARROTS AND GARLIC,
PLUS OTHER SPICES TO TASTE
• WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD TOPPED WITH ANY NUT BUTTER—EVEN PEANUT BUTTER (NOT
BUTTER OR MARGARINE)
• HIGH-FIBER SALAD
• WHOLE-FRUIT COCKTAIL
• OATMEAL COOKIE OR BRAN MUFFIN
FOR DINNER
• BURRITO MADE WITH REFRIED BEANS, RICE AND SALSA AND WRAPPED IN A WHOLEGRAIN TORTILLA
OR
• VEGETARIAN CHILI MADE WITH TOFU; CORNMEAL MUFFINS SLATHERED WITH NUT BUTTER
OR
• HOT DOGGONES: HOT DOG BUNS FILLED WITH COLESLAW, BARBECUE SAUCE, MUSTARD
AND ONIONS (IF YOU JUST CAN'T DO WITHOUT HOT DOGS, MAKE THEM VEGETARIAN);
LENTIL OR BLACK BEAN AND WILD RICE SOUP
OR
• NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER: ONE CUP EACH OF DICED CABBAGE, CARROTS,
ONIONS, CELERY AND POTATOES, WITH A DASH OF HERBS
AND
• A BIG GREEN SALAD
• FRUIT COCKTAIL
AFTER A WEEK OR TWO ON A DIET LIKE THIS ONE, I'LL WAGER THERE'LL BE A CHOLESTEROL
REDUCTION OF 10 TO 20 PERCENT IN MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS.
260
HIVE S
POUNDS THAT CAN BE ABSORBED INTO THE BLOODSTREAM, NUDGING OUT SOME OF THE CHOLESTEROL THAT'S THERE. IN MY DATABASE, THE FOOD THAT SHOWS UP THE HIGHEST IN PHYTOSTEROLS (BASED ON DRY WEIGHT) IS SESAME SEEDS.
OTHER FOODS THAT CONTAIN HIGH AMOUNTS OF PHYTOSTEROLS, IN DESCENDING ORDER
OF POTENCY, INCLUDE LETTUCE, SUNFLOWER SEEDS, HAZELNUTS, CUCUMBERS, ASPARAGUS,
OKRA, CAULIFLOWER, SPINACH, FIGS, ONIONS, STRAWBERRIES, PUMPKIN OR SQUASH,
RADISHES, APRICOTS, TOMATOES, CELERY AND GINGER.
YOU COULD EASILY USE THIS INFORMATION TO CONCOCT CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING
SALADS AND SOUPS TO REPLACE CHOLESTEROL-RAISING MEATS. A HIGH-PHYTOSTEROL FRUIT
SALAD, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD INCLUDE FIGS, STRAWBERRIES AND APRICOTS WITH GINGER.
V SHIITAKE (LENTINNS EDODES). THESE DELICIOUS MUSHROOMS CONTAIN THE
COMPOUND LENTINAN. ACCORDING TO THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS,
LENTINAN HAS CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING ACTION, ALONG WITH ANTI-TUMOR, ANTIVIRAL AND IMMUNE-STIMULATING EFFECTS. IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS GIVEN A LOW DOSE OF A COMPOUND RELATED TO LENTINAN, CHOLESTEROL LEVELS FELL 25 PERCENT.
HIVES
MANY YEARS AGO, MY SON, JOHN, NOW IN HIS THIRTIES, HAD A BOUT OF HIVES.
JOHN HAD BEEN DIGGING IN THE GARDEN, SO HIS HIVES COULD HAVE COME
FROM AN ALLERGY TO ONE OR MORE OF THE HUNDREDS OF PLANTS IN MY GARDEN. OR
MAYBE HE WAS ALLERGIC TO ONE OF THE ANIMALS THAT CALLED OUR PLACE HOME—CATS,
CHICKENS, GOATS, HORSES AND RABBITS, NOT TO MENTION SOME RATHER SOCIAL RACCOONS, DEER, FOXES, GROUNDHOGS AND POSSUMS.
HIVES BOTHERED JOHN ON AND OFF FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THEN AS HE GREW BEYOND
HIS TEENS, HIS HIVES DISAPPEARED, NEVER TO RETURN.
WE NEVER FIGURED OUT WHAT CAUSED JOHN'S HIVES. THEY WERE NEVER BAD
ENOUGH FOR US TO CONSULT AN EXPENSIVE ALLERGY SPECIALIST, AND IT WAS PROBABLY
JUST AS WELL. BEYOND A FEW COMMON ALLERGIES, IT'S OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR EVEN
THE PROS TO DETERMINE WHAT TRIGGERS HIVES.
WHENEVER THE HIVES PUT IN AN APPEARANCE, WE GAVE JOHN SOME DIPHENHYDRAMINE (BENADRYL), THE SYNTHETIC OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTIHISTAMINE, INSTEAD OF
HERBAL ANTIHISTAMINES. TODAY I'D GO THE HERBAL ROUTE, BUT JOHN HAD HIS HIVES
BEFORE I BECAME COMPLETELY CONVERTED TO NATURAL MEDICINES.
261
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
HOW HIVES HAPPEN
HIVES ARE ITCHY RED SKIN WELTS WITH WHITISH CENTERS. MEDICALLY, THEY'RE
KNOWN AS URTICARIA OR NETTLE RASH, A NAME INSPIRED BY THE FACT THAT THE STINGING
NETTLE PLANT CAN CAUSE THEM.
HIVES ARE A REACTION TO HISTAMINE, A SUBSTANCE SECRETED BY SPECIAL CELLS
KNOWN AS MAST CELLS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE BODY. SMALL AMOUNTS OF
HISTAMINE, INCIDENTALLY, ARE ALSO INJECTED INTO YOU WHEN YOU BUMP UP AGAINST
THE TINY HAIRS THAT COVER THE STINGING NETTLE PLANT.
THE HISTAMINE MADE BY YOUR BODY PLAYS A ROLE IN PRODUCING THE SYMPTOMS
OF HAY FEVER—TYPE ALLERGIES, INCLUDING SNEEZING AND WATERY EYES. THAT'S WHY ANTIHISTAMINES, SUBSTANCES THAT BLOCK THE NATURAL ACTION OF HISTAMINES, CAN HELP
TO TREAT SO MANY ALLERGY SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING HIVES.
SOME 15 TO 20 PERCENT OF AMERICANS EXPERIENCE HIVES AT SOME POINT IN
THEIR LIVES, MOST FREQUENTLY AS YOUNG ADULTS.
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CAN CAUSE AN ALLERGIC REACTION CAN CAUSE HIVES,
INCLUDING CERTAIN FOODS, ASPIRIN AND MANY OTHER DRUGS. SOMETIMES UNEXPECTED
THINGS CAUSE HIVES; ABOUT 3 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO USE SUNSCREEN GET HIVES, FOR
EXAMPLE. BUT IN MANY CASES, THE CAUSE OF HIVES REMAINS A MYSTERY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HIVES
PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER ANTIHISTAMINES ARE THE STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR HIVES. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF HERBAL APPROACHES.
W V JEWELWEED (IMPATIENS CAPENSIS). THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE HERBS FOR
HIVES. IT CONTAINS A COMPOUND CALLED LAWSONE THAT WORKS WONDERS.
I LEARNED ABOUT LAWSONE'S ANTI-HIVE ACTION AT THE 1995 ANNUAL SPRING
WILDFLOWER OUTING IN WINTERGREEN, VIRGINIA. MY LONG-TIME FRIEND, HERBALIST JIM
TROY, SLAPPED BOTH OF MY WRISTS WITH NETTLE PLANT UNTIL BOTH STUNG MIGHTILY. I
HAD WITH ME A BOTTLED SOLUTION OF LAWSONE WHICH ROBERT ROSEN, PH.D., A
CHEMIST AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY IN NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY, HAD PROVIDED.
I RUBBED THE SOLUTION ONTO MY RIGHT WRIST AND ENJOYED INSTANT RELIEF. THE HIVES
ON MY LEFT WRIST KEPT RIGHT ON ITCHING. THIS MINI-EXPERIMENT CONVINCED ME THAT
ANY PLANT CONTAINING THE COMPOUND LAWSONE, SUCH AS JEWELWEED, IS WORTH CONSIDERING AS A TREATMENT FOR HIVES.
IN FACT, SEVERAL OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THAT WILDFLOWER WALK TRIED CRUSHED
JEWELWEED LEAVES ON THEIR NETTLE-PRODUCED HIVES WITH GOOD RESULTS. UNTIL SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG, I WILL HEARTILY ENDORSE JEWELWEED FOR THE WHEALS INDUCED BY STINGING NETTLE, AND I'D RECOMMEND TRYING IT ON HIVES PRODUCED BY
OTHER CAUSES AS WELL.
262
HIVES
I'LL NEVER KNOW WHETHER A TOPICAL APPLICATION OF JEWELWEED WOULD HAVE
HELPED MY SON'S HIVES, BUT YOU CAN BET I'LL TRY IT ON MYSELF IF I EVER HAVE THE
SAME PROBLEM.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS REMEDY, YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH JEWELWEED, WHICH IS FAIRLY COMMON THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHAT
JEWELWEED LOOKS LIKE, YOU SHOULD FIND SOMEONE IN YOUR AREA WHO CAN SHOW YOU
THE PLANT—A LOCAL HERBALIST, PERHAPS, OR AN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AGENT.
W V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). YES, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VERY SAME
PLANT THAT WILL PRODUCE A WHEAL IF ITS HAIRS INJECT THEIR HISTAMINE INTO YOU. ANDREW
WEIL, M.D., AN HERB ADVOCATE WHO TEACHES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF
MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, SUGGESTS
USING FREEZE-DRIED NETTLE LEAF EXTRACT TO TREAT HIVES AND ALLERGIES. THIS MIGHT SOUND
ILLOGICAL, BUT THE PLANT APPARENTLY DOESN'T CONTAIN ENOUGH HISTAMINE TO BE A
PROBLEM WHEN IT'S TAKEN ORALLY, AND IT DOES CONTAIN SUBSTANCES THAT HELP HEAL
HIVES.
STINGING NETTLE IS SOLD IN CAPSULES IN HEALTH FOOD STORES. DR. WEIL SUGGESTS
TAKING ONE OR TWO EVERY TWO TO FOUR HOURS, AS NEEDED.
I HAVE A MENACING STAND OF STINGING NETTLE BACK BEHIND THE BARN, SO I'D
PERSONALLY OPT FOR CONSUMPTION OF A TEA MADE FROM THE LEAVES OR COOKED GREENS.
YOU'LL NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING THE GREENS, BUT THE STINGING HAIRS
LOSE THEIR STING WHEN THE PLANT IS COOKED, AND THE GREENS ARE DELICIOUS. STINGING
NETTLE IS A FAIRLY COMMON "WEED" THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, SO YOU MAY HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH HERB.
MORE RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE ROOT MAY BE EVEN MORE BENEFICIAL THAN
THE LEAVES. CAPSULES OF ROOT MATERIAL ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE, BUT IF YOU CAN GET
THE FRESH HERB, TRY HANGING SOME ROOTS TO DRY, THEN MAKING A TEA FROM SOME
DRIED, CHOPPED ROOT.
W NATURAL ANTIHISTAMINES. WHAT DOCTORS DON'T SAY—BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY DON'T KNOW—IS THAT MANY PLANTS CONTAIN ANTIHISTAMINE COMPOUNDS.
MY DATABASE IS FULL OF THESE PLANTS: CAMOMILE AND WILD OREGANO HAVE AT
LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT ANTIHISTAMINIC CHEMICALS, AND RUE HAS SIX. WEIGHING IN
WITH FIVE WE HAVE BASIL, ECHINACEA, FENNEL, FIG, GINKGO, GRAPEFRUIT, PASSIONFLOWER, TARRAGON, TEA, THYME AND YARROW.
SOME HERBAL EXPERTS WARN THAT CAMOMILE CAN CAUSE HISTAMINIC ALLERGIC
REACTIONS. THAT MAY BE SO IN SOME VERY SENSITIVE PEOPLE, BUT HERE ARE THE ANTIHISTAMINE COMPOUNDS IN THIS HERB: APIGENIN, ISORHAMNETIN, KAEMPFEROL, LUTEOLIN, QUERCETIN, RUTIN AND UMBELLIFERONE. THIS SET OF COMPOUNDS IS A GOOD
REASON TO GIVE THIS HERB A TRY. IF IT DOESN'T HELP, OR IF IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE HIVES
WORSE, SIMPLY DISCONTINUE USE.
263
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
FOR THE GREATEST VARIETY OF ANTIHISTAMINE COMPOUNDS, MY COMPUTER SUGGESTS MAKING A TEA WITH A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL ANTIHISTAMINE HERBS, INCLUDING BASIL, CAMOMILE, FENNEL, OREGANO, TARRAGON AND TEA. (JUST TO CLEAR UP
ANY POSSIBLE CONFUSION HERE, I'M TALKING ABOUT MAKING A BREW USING THE HERBAL
METHOD OF PREPARING TEA AND INCLUDING IN IT A TYPICAL BEVERAGE TEA.)
I SUGGEST POURING A FEW CUPS OF TEA MADE FROM THIS HERBAL MIXTURE INTO YOUR
BATH OR DIPPING A CLEAN CLOTH INTO IT AND APPLYING IT AS A COMPRESS. YOU CAN
ALSO DRINK IT AS A BEVERAGE, BECAUSE THE ANTIHISTAMINES WILL WORK INSIDE YOUR
BODY AS WELL AS ON THE OUTSIDE.
IF THIS TEA HELPS, RESPECT IT AND USE IT. IF IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HELP, REJECT IT.
ALL OF THESE HERBS, HOWEVER, ARE GENERALLY REGARDED AS SAFE.
W PARSLEY {PETRO&ELINUM CRISPUM). ONE SCIENTIFIC STUDY SHOWED THAT
PARSLEY INHIBITS THE SECRETION OF HISTAMINE. IF YOU HAVE HIVES, TRY JUICING SOME
PARSLEY AND ADDING IT TO SOME OTHER VEGETABLE JUICE, SUCH AS CARROT OR TOMATO, TO
MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE.
V AMARANTH (AMARANTHUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). A TEA MADE WITH AMARANTH
SEEDS MAKES A GOOD WASH FOR HIVES, ECZEMA AND PSORIASIS, ACCORDING TO THE WIDELY
TRAVELED MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS AND MANY OTHER BOOKS RELATING TO
HEALING WITH HERBS AND FOODS. TO MAKE THIS TEA, ADD TWO TEASPOONS OF AMARANTH
SEEDS TO THREE CUPS OF BOILING WATER AND LET IT STEEP FOR 10 TO 20 MINUTES. IF I WERE
TREATING MY OWN HIVES, PD ADD SOME JEWELWEED, TOO.
V GINGER {ZINGIBER OFFICINALE)* WHEN CANADIAN HERBALIST TERRY
WILLARD, PRESIDENT OF THE CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF HERBAL PRACTITIONERS AND AUTHOR OF TEXTBOOK OF MODERN HERBOLOGY, DEVELOPED HIVES AS A RESULT OF A FOOD ALLERGY, HE SIMMERED A HALF-POUND OF GINGER IN A GALLON OF WATER IN A BIG POT FOR FIVE
MINUTES AND ADDED THE RESULTING BREW TO A HOT BATH. AFTER STEEPING HIMSELF FOR A
WHILE, HE SPONGED OFF WITH CAMOMILE TEA (ONE TEASPOON IN ONE CUP OF BOILING
WATER). "IT WORKED EVERY TIME," HE SAYS.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST USING CAMOMILE OIL
TO TREAT HIVES, AND I AGREE: PLACE A DROP OR TWO DIRECDY ON YOUR HIVES AND MASSAGE
IT IN. SPEAKING OF ESSENTIAL OILS, THE OILS OF CARAWAY, CLOVE AND LEMON BALM (ALSO
KNOWN AS MELISSA) ARE ALL ANTIHISTAMINIC, ACCORDING TO PHANNACOGNOSIST (NATURAL
PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. MIXING A FEW DROPS OF EACH OF THESE OILS
INTO A COUPLE OF OUNCES OF VEGETABLE OIL WILL RESULT IN A SOOTHING OINTMENT THAT
MIGHT HELP RELIEVE ITCHING. JUST REMEMBER NOT TO INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS, AS EVEN A
SMALL AMOUNT MAY BE TOXIC.
V ASSORTED HERBS. SOME HERBALISTS SUGGEST DRINKING VALERIAN TEA FOR
RELIEF OF HIVES THAT ARE BROUGHT ON BY ANXIETY OR STRESS, AS VALERIAN IS A GOOD NATURAL
264
HIV INFECTIO N
SEDATIVE. OTHERS SUGGEST APPLYING ALOE GEL TO SOOTHE THE WHEALS.
FOR INTENSELY ITCHY HIVES, TRY A FEW HANDFULS OF OATMEAL IN A WARM BATH. IT
WORKS SURPRISINGLY WELL.
CORNMINT OR PEPPERMINT, TAKEN AS A TEA OR A WASH, MIGHT HELP IN TREATING
HIVES. MENTHOL, ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS IN MINTS, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ITCHRELIEVING ACTION.
H IV INFECTION (AIDS)
H
E WAS A DESPERATE MAN, DYING OF AIDS. HIS BODY WAS WEAK, HIS MONEY WAS
GONE, AND A FRIEND HAD COME TO SEE ME, ASKING, "WHAT CAN WE DO?"
TTIEY HAD TRIED EVERY STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT, BUT THE AIDS PATIENT'S T-CELL
COUNT WAS STILL GOING DOWN. T-CELLS ARE PART OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHEN A PERSON
HAS AIDS, THE T-CELLS ARE EVENTUALLY WIPED OUT, LEAVING THE PERSON WIDE OPEN TO OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS.
I GAVE HIM MY STANDARD ANSWER: "I AM A BOTANIST, NOT A DOCTOR. I DO NOT PRESCRIBE MEDICINE."
"BUT JIM," THE FRIEND BEGGED. "WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD AIDS?
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING HERBAL YOU'D TAKE."
TRIE HERBAL APPROACH
THERE WERE INDEED SEVERAL THINGS, AND I SHARED THEM WITH HIM. IF I HAD
AIDS, I SAID, I WOULD BREW A TEA CONTAINING ST.-JOHN'S-WORT, OREGANO, SELF-HEAL
AND HYSSOP AND GENEROUSLY SWEETEN IT WITH LICORICE. I MIGHT STILL TAKE THE
PROVEN IMMUNE BOOSTERS, ECHINACEA AND ASTRAGALUS, EVEN THOUGH THEIR USE IS
NOT SO WIDELY RECOMMENDED ANY MORE. FINALLY, I'D EAT A LOT OF GARLIC AND ONIONS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE MAN WITH AIDS TRIED ANY OF MY SUGGESTIONS, AS I NEVER
HEARD FROM HIS FRIEND AGAIN. MAYBE HE AND HIS "FRIEND" WERE ONE AND THE SAME.
HERBS, OF COURSE, CAN'T CURE AIDS. ANYONE INFECTED WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) THAT CAUSES IT SHOULD CERTAINLY BE UNDER A DOCTOR'S
CARE. THE NEW COMBINATIONS OF ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS NOW ACTUALLY REDUCE THE
AMOUNT OF VIRUS IN THE BODY AND HELP PROLONG LIFE. AND SEVERAL OF THE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS, PARTICULARLY AIDS-RELATED PNEUMONIA, CAN BE BOTH PREVENTED AND TREATED.
265
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
BUT IN ADDITION TO TREATMENTS PRESCRIBED BY PHYSICIANS, I'D ALSO SUGGEST
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HIV-POSITIVE TRY CERTAIN IMMUNE-STIMULATING HERBS. I BELIEVE THAT THEY HELP. YOU SHOULD BE AWARE, HOWEVER, THAT SOME RESEARCHERS HAVE
SUGGESTED THAT BOOSTING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ALSO INCREASES THE FEROCITY OF THE
HIV ATTACK ON IT. BASED ON WHAT'S NOW KNOWN, HOWEVER, I DON'T FIND THAT VIEW
PERSUASIVE YET.
PERSONALLY, I WOULD GO THE NUTRITIONAL AND IMMUNE-STIMULANT ROUTE, ESPECIALLY IF MY T-CELL COUNTS SEEMED TO RESPOND WELL. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE
WITH HIV INFECTION TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE LATEST RESEARCH AND ACT ACCORDING TO
THE LATEST AND BEST FINDINGS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HIV INFECTION
BY ALL MEANS, DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR ANY HERBS THAT YOU WANT TO TRY. HERE
ARE SEVERAL THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL.
W V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE TEA IS ACTIVE AGAINST MANY
VIRUSES. THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IN LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZIN) CAN INHIBIT A NUMBER OF
PROCESSES INVOLVED IN VIRAL REPLICATION, SUCH AS A VIRUS'S ABILITY TO PENETRATE HOST
CELLS AND CHANGE THEIR GENETIC MATERIAL.
IN STUDIES, THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT GLYCYRRHIZIN INHIBITS THE GROWTH OF
HIV IN THE TEST TUBE. A FEW CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE ALSO PRODUCED INTRIGUINGLY POSITIVE RESULTS.
IN ONE STUDY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HIV-POSITIVE BUT WITHOUT AIDS SYMPTOMS, JAPANESE SCIENTISTS CLAIM THAT GLYCYRRHIZIN DELAYED THE APPEARANCE OF
SYMPTOMS RELATED TO HIV.
IN ANOTHER REPORT, PEOPLE WITH HEMOPHILIA WHO HAD GOTTEN THE HIV INFECTION FROM BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS WERE GIVEN GLYCYRRHIZIN FOR MORE THAN A MONTH.
DURING THAT TIME, THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS IN THEIR BLOOD DECREASED CONSIDERABLY,
SUGGESTING THAT THE HERBAL COMPOUND MIGHT INHIBIT HIV REPLICATION IN PEOPLE.
FINALLY, GLYCYRRHIZIN SEEMS TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AZT.
IF I HAD HIV, I'D ADD A ONE-OUNCE PIECE OF LICORICE ROOT TO A QUART OF ANY OF
MY HERBAL TEAS, OR I'D JUST CHEW ON THE ROOT. OTHERS MIGHT PREFER TAKING STANDARDIZED COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
WHILE LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE
AMOUNTS—UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY—LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF
LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION,
EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
VVV OREGANO {ORIGANUM VULGARE) AND SELF-HEAL {PRUNELLA VULGARIS).
MANY AIDS DEATHS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY CAUSED BY A PROCESS KNOWN AS OXIDATIVE
STRESS, ACCORDING TO NEW YORK AIDS RESEARCHER HOWARD GREENSPAN, M.D. THIS
266
HIV INFECTIO N
I
5
'A
KIND OF STRESS IS THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE DONE TO THE BODY'S CELLS
BY HARMFUL OXYGEN MOLECULES KNOWN
AS FREE RADICALS.
DR. GREENSPAN SUGGESTS THAT INCREASING ANTIOXIDANT INTAKE CAN HELP
MAINTAIN IMMUNE FUNCTION IN THOSE
WHO ARE HIV-POSITIVE. (ANTIOXIDANTS
ARE SUBSTANCES THAT MOP UP FREE RADICALS BY NEUTRALIZING THEIR ABILITY TO
DO DAMAGE.) HIS REASONING IS PERSUASIVE. IF I HAD HIV, FD DRINK PLENTY OF
ANTIOXIDANT TEAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
MADE FROM SELF-HEAL AND OREGANO, THE
HERBS WITH THE MOST ANTIOXIDANTS
AMONG THE 60 FVE STUDIED. BETTER
YET, SWEETEN THESE TEAS WITH LICORICE
TO IMPROVE THEIR FLAVOR AND GET THE
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF GLYCYRRHIZIN.
W * ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). THIS HERB CONTAINS HYPERICIN AND PSEUDOHYPERICIN,
COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ANTIVIRAL. THESE
COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE
ACTIVE AGAINST HIV, AT LEAST IN THE LW
TEST TUBE. IN FACT, A MIXTURE OF HYPERICIN AND SEVERAL DERIVATIVES HAS BEEN PATENTED AS A TREATMENT FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION, ONE OF THE MANY OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS THAT CAN
STRIKE PEOPLE WITH AIDS.
RESEARCHERS APPARENTLY STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE THEY UNDERSTAND THE FULL THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF THESE TWO COMPOUNDS IN TREATING HIV. IN
TEST-TUBE AND ANIMAL STUDIES, PSEUDOHYPERICIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE
SPREAD OF HIV WHILE A FEW SURVEYS OF PEOPLE WITH AIDS HAVE SUGGESTED SOME
VALUE FOR HYPERICIN, THE DATA ARE IFFY, AND WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
MEANWHILE, YOU CAN TRY TAKING ST.-JOHNVWORT. I'D USE A TINCTURE MADE
FROM THE WHOLE HERB AND TAKE 10 TO 30 DROPS IN JUICE SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT CONTAINS MAO INHIBITORS. PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING MAO INHIBITORS, OR USING HERBS THAT CONTAIN THEM, ON A REGULAR BASIS NEED TO AVOID CERTAIN FOODS (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND SMOKED OR PICKLED FOODS) AND MEDICATIONS
ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS PUNGENT
VEGETABLE DISH CONTAIN COMPOUNDS THAT
HELP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM FIGHT VIRUSES,
AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT BURDOCK
HAS PROPERTIES THAT SPECFICALLY FIGHT HIV.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SUCH AS COLD AND HAY FEVER REMEDIES, AMPHETAMINES, NARCOTICS, TRYPTOPHAN AND
TYROSINE. YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE ST.-JOHN'S-WORT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, AND YOU SHOULD
AVOID INTENSE SUN EXPOSURE WHILE USING IT, SINCE THIS HERB CAN MAKE THE SKIN
MORE SENSITIVE TO SUNLIGHT.
VV. ALOE (ALOE VERA). THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT ACEMANNAN, A POTENT IMMUNE-STIMULATING COMPOUND FOUND IN ALOE, MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN TREATING AIDS.
IN TEST-TUBE STUDIES, ACEMANNAN WAS SHOWN TO BE ACTIVE AGAINST HIV. ACEMANNAN MAY ALSO REDUCE REQUIREMENTS FOR AZT, THUS MINIMIZING THE SIDE EFFECTS OF
THAT POTENT DRUG.
THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF ACEMANNAN IS UP TO 250 MILLIGRAMS FOUR
TIMES A DAY. MUCH HIGHER DOSES (UP TO 1,000 MILLIGRAMS PER KILOGRAM OF BODY
WEIGHT PER DAY) HAVE CAUSED NO TOXIC EFFECTS IN DOGS AND RATS. AND ACCORDING TO
THE AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR AIDS RESEARCH, "PILOT TRIALS HAVE NOT REVEALED
ANY TOXIC EFFECTS IN MAN."
IT TAKES ABOUT A LITER OF ALOE JUICE (ABOUT A QUART) TO PROVIDE 1,600 MILLIGRAMS OF ACEMANNAN. I PERSONALLY SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT OF DRINKING ALMOST A
LITER OF ALOE JUICE A DAY. BUT IF I HAD HIV, I MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENDY. YOU CAN BUY
THE JUICE AT MOST HEALTH FOOD STORES, BUT DON'T TRY TO PREPARE YOUR OWN. THE
JUICE CAN HAVE AN OVERLY POWERFUL LAXATIVE EFFECT IF NOT PREPARED PROPERLY.
VV ASTRAGALUS (ASTRAGALUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). KNOWN AS HUANG QI IN
CHINA, THIS IMMUNE-BOOSTING HERB IS THE ASIAN ANSWER TO AMERICA'S ECHINACEA.
ASTRAGALUS HAS NO DEMONSTRATED ANTI-HIV EFFECT THAT I KNOW OF, BUT IT'S
SAFE. IF I HAD HIV, I WOULD GIVE IT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BASED ON ITS KNOWN
POTENT ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER VIRUSES.
IN ONE STUDY, TEN PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS VIRAL INFECTIONS SHOWED LOW LEVELS OF
NATURAL KILLER CELLS (NKCS) IN THEIR BODIES. NKCS ARE SPECIAL WHITE BLOOD CELLS
THAT ATTACK DISEASE-CAUSING MICROORGANISMS. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN
INJECTIONS OF ASTRAGALUS EXTRACTS FOR FOUR MONTHS. COMPARED WITH PEOPLE WHO
DID NOT RECEIVE THE EXTRACT, THEIR NKC ACTIVITY INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, OTHER
COMPONENTS OF THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM PERKED UP, AND THEIR SYMPTOMS IMPROVED.
I BELIEVE THAT ORAL PREPARATIONS HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT.
VV BLACK-EYED SUSAN (RUDBECKIA, VARIOUS SPECIES). BASED ON ITS
FOLKORIC USE, I SUSPECTED FOR YEARS THAT THE MARYLAND STATE FLOWER, THE BLACK-EYED
SUSAN, MIGHT BE AS STRONG AN IMMUNE STIMULANT AS THE VARIOUS SPECIES OF ECHINACEA. MY HUNCH WAS CONFIRMED BY A RESEARCH REPORT SAYING THAT ROOT EXTRACTS INDEED DO A BETTER JOB OF STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAN DO EXTRACTS OF
ECHINACEA.
IF I HAD AIDS, I'D MAKE A TEA WITH FIVE TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER AND DRINK A CUP TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY.
268
HIV INFECTIO N
VV BLESSED THISTLE (CNICUS BENE DIE TUS). COMPOUNDS FOUND IN THIS
HERB REPORTEDLY HAVE ANTI-HIV ACTIVITY. I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO STEEP ABOUT FIVE
TEASPOONS OF THIS HERB IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER AND DRINK IT TWO OR THREE TIMES
A DAY.
VV BURDOCK (ARCTIUM LAPPA). ACCORDING TO THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER, BURDOCK
JUICE OR EXTRACTS SHOW TEST-TUBE ACTIVITY AGAINST
HIV. NOT TOO LONG AGO, I ENJOYED A DISH I CALLED
GOBO GUMBO (GOBO IS THE JAPANESE NAME FOR
BURDOCK). THE RECIPE IS ON PAGE 267.
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA^
VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS
CONEFLOWER, THIS DAISYLIKE NATIVE OF THE
GREAT PLAINS IS ONE OF THE BEST IMMUNESTIMULANT HERBS. THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS APPEAR TO BE CAFFEIC ACID,
CHICORIC ACID AND ECHINACIN, ALL OF
WHICH HAVE ANTIVIRAL PROPERTIES SIMILAR
TO THOSE OF INTERFERON, THE BODY'S OWN
ANTIVIRAL COMPOUND. RECENT EVIDENCE
SHOWS GREAT PROMISE FOR CHICORIC ACID
AS A TREATMENT FOR THIS DISEASE.
ECHINACEA ALSO INCREASES THE
BODY'S LEVELS OF A HEALING COMPOUND
KNOWN AS PROPERDIN. PROPERDIN HELPS
INFECTION-FIGHTING WHITE BLOOD CELLS
REACH INFECTED AREAS IN THE BODY.
BURDOCK CONTAINS COMPOUNDS THAT
MAY BE ACTIVE AGAINST HIV.
THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT OVER WHICH OF THE THREE MAIN ECHINACEA
SPECIES (E. ANGUSTIFOLIA, E. PALLIDA AND E. PURPUREA) IS BEST. HERBALIST PAUL
BERGNER, EDITOR OF MEDICAL HERBALISM, SUGGESTS MIXING ALL THREE. I AGREE.
IF I HAD HIV, I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO MAKE A TEA WITH FIVE TEASPOONS OF DRIED
HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND DRINK IT TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY. BUT FOR MOST
PEOPLE, IT'S EASIER TO ADD A DROPPERFUL OF TINCTURE TO JUICE A FEW TIMES A DAY. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS
EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
MOST HERBALISTS ADVISE AGAINST TAKING ECHINACEA DAILY. THEY MAINTAIN THAT
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO THE HERB AND THAT THE
HERB CEASES TO HAVE A STIMULATING EFFECT. IF I HAD HIV, I'D PROBABLY TAKE ECHINACEA DAILY FOR A WEEK OR TWO, THEN STOP TAKING IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS, ADOPTING THIS
AS AN ONGOING PATTERN.
269
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE SHOWN GARLIC TO BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST SEVERAL OF THE OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS OF AIDS, INCLUDING HERPES AND
PNEUMOCYSTIS PNEUMONIA. RESEARCHERS HAVE ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE COMPOUND AJOENE, FOUND IN GARLIC, MAY INHIBIT
THE SPREAD OF HIV WITHIN THE BODY.
EATING THREE TO FIVE CLOVES OF GARLIC A
DAY IS HELPFUL IN PREVENTING OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS, ACCORDING TO HERBALIST SUBHUTI
DHARMANANDA, PH.D., DIRECTOR OF THE IMMUNE ENHANCEMENT PROJECT IN PORTLAND,
OREGON, AND AUTHOR OF GARLIC AS THE CENTRAL
HERB THERAPY FOR AIDS.
V%. HYSSOP (HYSSOPUS OFFICINALIS).
HYSSOP TEA CONTAINS A COMPOUND CALLED
MAR-10. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN TEST
TUBES, THIS COMPOUND INHIBITS HIV REPLICATION
WITH NO TOXICITY TO HEALTHY CELLS. THE RESEARCHERS WHO DISCOVERED THIS EFFECT SPECULATE
THAT HYSSOP MIGHT BE USEFUL IN TREATING PEOPLE
WITH HIV.
IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW FOR SURE, BUT FVE
FOUND NO REPORTS SHOWING THAT HYSSOP CAUSES
ANY HARM, EVEN IN LARGE DOSES. IF I WERE HIVPOSITIVE, TD MIX A FEW TEASPOONS OF THE DRIED
HERB INTO MY HERB TEAS.
VV ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONION IS
ONE OF OUR BEST SOURCES OF THE ANTIOXIDANT
COMPOUND QUERCETIN, WHICH IS MOST HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN ONION SKIN. ONION IS
ALSO A CLOSE RELATIVE OF GARLIC AND HAS MANY OF THE SAME ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS.
IF I HAD HIV, I WOULD EAT LOTS OF ONIONS. AND WHENEVER I MADE SOUPS OR STEWS
USING ONIONS, I'D LEAVE THE SKIN ON TO GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE QUERCETIN. (YOU CAN
FISH OUT THE SKIN JUST PRIOR TO SERVING.)
V * PEA R (PYRUS COMMUNIS). IF I HAD HIV, I'D EAT A PEAR A DAY. THIS FRUIT IS
ONE OF THE BETTER SOURCES OF CAFFEIC AND CHLOROGENIC ACIDS. CAFFEIC ACID IS AN IMMUNE STIMULANT, AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT CHLOROGENIC ACID HAS ACTIVITY
AGAINST HIV. (THESE COMPOUNDS CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN LESSER AMOUNTS IN APPLES.)
V ELDERBERRY (SAMBUCUS NIGRA). ELDERBERRY HAS AN AGE-OLD REPUTATION
AS A REMEDY FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS, AND IT IS BEING STUDIED FOR ACTIVITY AGAINST HIV. I
SUSPECT IT HAS SOME.
HYSSOP
ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE
EXTENSIVE MINT FAMILY, HYSSOP
WAS COMMONLY USED AS AN AIR
FRESHENER IN SEVENTEENTHCENTURY EUROPE.
270
HIV INFECTIO N
IF I HAD HIV, I'D EAT LOTS OF ELDERBERRIES. ELDERBERRY IS A COMMON SHRUB IN
AMERICA, AND THE FRUIT IS SOMETIMES PROCESSED INTO JAMS AND JELLIES. TALK ABOUT A
NICE WAY TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE!
V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THE OIL OF THIS HERB (EPO)
IS RICH IN GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA). IN STUDIES DONE BY RESEARCHERS IN TANZANIA, THE LIFE EXPECTANCIES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE HIV-POSITIVE WERE MORE THAN DOUBLED BY ADDING GLA AND BENEFICIAL OILS KNOWN AS OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS TO THEIR
DIETS.
GLA CAN BE OBTAINED FROM FOUR DIFFERENT FOOD PLANTS: EVENING PRIMROSE,
BORAGE, CURRANT AND HOPS. MOST PEOPLE TAKE TWO TO FOUR CAPSULES OF EPO A DAY.
WHAT DO I DO? I GRIND UP THE SEEDS AND ADD THEM TO CORNBREAD OR SOUP.
FISH IS THE BEST SOURCE OF OMEGA-3'S, BUT YOU CAN GET THEM FROM PLANT
SOURCES AS WELL, INCLUDING FLAXSEED, PURSLANE, BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND WALNUTS.
(VEGETARIANS TAKE NOTE.)
V ICELAND MOSS (CETRARIA ISLANDICA). UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS SCIENTISTS
HAVE FOUND THAT COMPOUNDS ISOLATED FROM ICELAND MOSS INHIBIT AN ENZYME THAT'S
ESSENTIAL TO REPLICATION OF HIV AZT AND THREE OTHER AIDS DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN
APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION DO THE SAME THING, BUT IT'S BEEN
SHOWN THAT THESE DRUGS ARE TOXIC AND DO NOT COMPLETELY INHIBIT THE VIRUS. THE MOSS
CONSTITUENTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WERE FOUND IN LABORATORY STUDIES TO BE NONTOXIC
TO CELLS. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFE FOOD PHARMACEUTICAL AND I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADD IT
TO SOUPS OR SALADS.
V ASSORTED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. IN ADDITION TO TAKING A NUMBER OF THE
HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPER, I WOULD ALSO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO NUTRITION
AND EAT LOTS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IF I HAD HIV A STUDY BY RESEARCHERS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY SHOWED THAT IF PEOPLE WHO ARE HIV-POSITIVE
EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, IT TAKES THEM LONGER TO DEVELOP THE OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS OF FULL-BLOWN AIDS.
V LEGUME NODULES. IF I WERE TAKING AZT, I WOULD ALSO CONSUME A FEW
LEGUME NODULES, THE LITTLE "CAPSULES" OF BACTERIA SCATTERED ALONG THE ROOTS OF MOST
LEGUMES.
LEGUME NODULES ARE REPORTEDLY THE BEST VEGETABLE SOURCE OF A COMPOUND
CALLED HEME IRON. STUDIES SHOW THAT HEME BOOSTS THE ANTI-HIV ACTIVITY OF AZT.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN LEGUME NODULES FOR SALE, BUT I GROW A LOT OF BEANS, AND I HAVE
UPROOTED THEM AND TAKEN THE NODULES LIKE CAPSULES. THERE'S NO PLEASURE IN
THIS, AS THEY DON'T TASTE GOOD. BUT THAT'S NATURE'S WAY OF DISCOURAGING AN OVERDOSE OF THESE IRON-RICH NODULES. OF COURSE, IF YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU THAT YOU
HAVE IRON OVERLOAD, YOU SHOULD AVOID THIS THERAPY.
V VITAMINS AND MINERALS. STUDIES SUGGEST THAT USING NUTRITION TO BOOST
271
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAY PROLONG THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH AIDS AS EFFECTIVELY
AS SOME OF THE DRUGS USED TO TREAT IT.
ANTIOXIDANTS ARE ESPECIALLY RECOMMENDED, INCLUDING VITAMINS C AND E,
THE VITAMIN A-LIKE NUTRIENTS BETA-CAROTENE AND LYCOPENE AND THE MINERAL SELENIUM. SELENIUM IS PLENTIFUL IN BRAZIL NUTS, AND THE OTHERS CAN BE FOUND IN
FRUITS, VEGETABLES, NUTS AND WHOLE GRAINS. PERSONALLY, I PREFER FOODS TO SUPPLEMENTS, BUT THESE NUTRIENTS ARE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE IN SUPPLEMENTS. IF I HAD HIV,
I WOULD DEFINITELY CONSULT A CLINICAL NUTRITIONIST.
HYPOTKYROIJISM
T
HYROID HORMONES REGULATE THE METABOLISM IN EVERY CELL OF YOUR BODY.
FOR THAT REASON, HAVING TOO LITTLE OF THE HORMONES, A CONDITION KNOWN
AS HYPOTHYROIDISM, CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT.
SYMPTOMS INCLUDE LETHARGY, DEPRESSION, HEADACHES, LOW BODY TEMPERATURE,
UNUSUAL SENSITIVITY TO COLD, DECREASED LIBIDO, DIFFICULTY LOSING WEIGHT, DRY SKIN,
PAINFUL MENSTRUAL PERIODS, SLOW REFLEXES, GOITER AND RECURRENT INFECTIONS.
HYPOTHYROIDISM VARIES IN INTENSITY FROM VERY MINOR AND ALMOST UNNOTICEABLE SYMPTOMS TO A SEVERE AND LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION KNOWN AS MYXEDEMA.
MANY SO-CALLED ALLERGIC DISEASES MAY IN FACT BE DUE TO THYROID DISORDERS.
THE THYROID GLAND IS LOCATED IN THE NECK JUST BEHIND AND BELOW THE ADAM'S
APPLE. ITS HORMONE PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THREE THINGS: THE AVAILABILITY OF THE
MINERAL IODINE, THE HEALTH OF THE GLAND ITSELF AND THE AMOUNT OF THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH) CIRCULATING IN THE BODY. TSH IS RELEASED BY THE PITUITARY
GLAND, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE BRAIN. ORDINARILY, AS TSH LEVELS INCREASE, THE LEVELS OF THYROID HORMONES IN THE BODY INCREASE ACCORDINGLY TO
REACH A BALANCE. IF THE THYROID IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, THE PITUITARY RELEASES MORE TSH IN A VAIN EFFORT TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.
THYROID DISEASE AFFECTS MORE THAN SIX MILLION AMERICANS. WOMEN ARE EIGHT
TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO HAVE HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND IT IS ESPECIALLY PREVALENT
AMONG OLDER WOMEN.
IF YOUR THYROID GLAND IS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, YOU NEED TO HAVE A DOCTOR
DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND PRESCRIBE APPROPRIATE MEDICATION.
272
HYPOTHYROIDIS M
GREEN PHARMACY FOR HYPOTHYROIDISM
I DO NOT RECOMMEND HERBS AS THE PRIMARY TREATMENT FOR ANY THYROID CONDITION. NATURAL APPROACHES, HOWEVER, CAN BE VALUABLE SUPPLEMENTS TO MEDICATION. IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER YOUR DOCTOR RECOMMENDS, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
SEVERAL NATURAL REMEDIES.
MY TOP HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BUGLEWEED, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN
AS MELISSA), SELF-HEAL AND VERBENA. AMAZINGLY ENOUGH, THESE SAME HERBS ALSO
HELP WITH GRAVES' DISEASE, A CONDITION THAT INVOLVES TOO MUCH THYROID HORMONE,
BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO NORMALIZE THYROID HORMONE LEVELS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE. (FOR OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THESE
HELPFUL HERBS, SEE PAGE 225.) HERE ARE SOME OTHER NATURAL APPROACHES FOR
FIGHTING HYPOTHYROIDISM.
V GENTIAN (GENTIANA OFFICINALIS). HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL
MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL
TONIC THERAPIES AND AN HERBALIST I RESPECT, SAYS THAT GENTIAN "PROVIDES BITTER PRINCIPLES KNOWN TO NORMALIZE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE THYROID." HE SUGGESTS GENTIAN AS
THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN HIS OWN THYROID FORMULA, A COMBINATION OF GENTIAN, RED
PEPPER (CAYENNE), IRISH MOSS, KELP AND SAW PALMETTO. IF I HAD HYPOTHYROIDISM, I
WOULD NOT HESITATE TO TAKE THIS COMBO.
V KELP (FUCUS RETICULOSIS). KELP IS HIGH IN IODINE, A KEY MINERAL THAT
THE BODY MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THYROID HORMONES. UROLOGIST JAMES BALCH,
M.D., AND HIS WIFE, PHYLLIS, A CERTIFIED NUTRITIONAL CONSULTANT, STRONGLY RECOMMEND
SEA KELP FOR TREATING HYPOTHYROIDISM.
WORKING KELP INTO YOUR DAILY DIET ISN'T LIKELY TO HURT. YOU CAN BUY POWDERED KELP IN HEALTH FOOD STORES TO SPRINKLE OVER YOUR FOOD AS A SEASONING. YOU
MIGHT ALSO TRY PUTTING A LITTLE KELP IN YOUR SOUPS, OR GO TO A JAPANESE RESTAURANT
AND ORDER SUSHI, THE VEGGIE OR RAW FISH AND RICE TREAT THAT'S WRAPPED IN KELP.
V MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA, SINAPIS ALBA AND OTHERS). IN ADDITION
TO HAVING A HIGH IODINE CONTENT, THYROID HORMONES ARE MADE FROM THE COMPOUND
TYROSINE. MUSTARD GREENS ARE THE BEST SOURCE OF TYROSINE I KNOW, WITH 1.9 PERCENT
ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. SEVERAL OTHER FOODS THAT INCLUDE TYROSINE, IN DESCENDING
ORDER OF POTENCY, ARE VELVET BEAN SEEDS, CAROB, WINGED BEANS, BEAN SPROUTS,
LUPINES, SOYBEANS, OATS, PEANUTS, SPINACH, WATERCRESS, SESAME SEEDS, BUTTERNUT
SQUASH, CHAYA, CHIVES, FAVA BEANS, LAMB'S-QUARTERS, PIGWEED, PUMPKIN SEEDS,
SNOWPEAS AND CABBAGE.
ALONG WITH IODINE FROM KELP, THE TYROSINE IN ANY OF THESE PLANTS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE
TO INCREASED PRODUCTION OF THE THYROID HORMONE THYROXINE. I COULD SEE MAKING A TASTY
273
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
SOUP WITH KELP, MUSTARD GREENS, SPINACH, SESAME SEEDS, SQUASH AND BEANS. OR TRY A
SALAD WITH MUSTARD GREENS, SPINACH, LAMB'S-QUARTERS, BEAN SPROUTS, RADISHES,
PUMPKIN SEEDS AND SESAME SEEDS.
V RADISH (RAPHANUS SATIVIIS). RADISHES HAVE LONG BEEN USED IN RUSSIA
FOR TREATING BOTH TYPES OF THYROID PROBLEMS, ACCORDING TO MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST
JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABAND HERBS, RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS TOLD HIM THAT ONE CHEMICAL IN RADISHES, RAPHANIN,
HELPS KEEP LEVELS OF THYROID HORMONES IN BALANCE. WITH ENOUGH RAPHANIN CIRCULATING IN THE BLOOD, THE GLAND IS LESS LIKELY TO OVERPRODUCE OR UNDERPRODUCE THESE
HORMONES.
V ST.-JOHNVWORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). LIKE MANY PHARMACEUTICAL
ANTIDEPRESSANTS, THIS HERB IS A MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) INHIBITOR. DEPRESSION IS
A COMMON SYMPTOM OF HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND MAO INHIBITORS CAN HELP ELEVATE
MOOD. ALTHOUGH THIS HERB ADDRESSES A COMMON SYMPTOM OF HYPOTHYROIDISM, NOT
THE CONDITION ITSELF, IT MIGHT HELP IF YOU HAVE DEPRESSION. (FOR OTHER HELPFUL HERBS
FOR DEPRESSION, SEE PAGE 156.)
PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING MAO INHIBITORS OR USING HERBS THAT CONTAIN MAO
INHIBITORS ON A REGULAR BASIS NEED TO AVOID CERTAIN FOODS—ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
AND SMOKED OR PICKLED FOODS—AND SOME MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING COLD AND HAY
FEVER REMEDIES, AMPHETAMINES, NARCOTICS, TRYPTOPHAN AND TYROSINE. ALSO, PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD NOT TAKE ST.-JOHNVWORT, AND EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID INTENSE SUN EXPOSURE WHILE USING IT, SINCE THIS HERB CAN MAKE THE SKIN MORE
SENSITIVE TO SUNLIGHT.
V WALNUT (JUGUMS, VARIOUS SPECIES). IN TURKISH FOLK MEDICINE, WALNUTS ARE USED AS REMEDIES FOR VARIOUS GLANDULAR DISORDERS, INCLUDING THYROID PROBLEMS. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT. IN ONE STUDY, THE FRESH JUICE OF GREEN
WALNUTS DOUBLED LEVELS OF THYROXINE. A DECOCTION OF GREEN WALNUTS, MADE BY
BOILING THEM FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, BOOSTED THYROXINE AT LEAST 30 PERCENT.
YOU MIGHT GET SOME BENEFIT FROM WALNUTS SIMPLY BY ENJOYING THEM BY THE
HANDFUL, AND YOU COULD ALSO USE WALNUT OIL AS A FLAVORFUL ADDITION TO SALAD DRESSINGS.
BUT IT'S THE GREEN HUSKS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT
PLEASING TO THE PALATE.
274
INDIGESTION
S
OME 30 YEARS AGO, MY FAMILY AND I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IN
PANAMA. WHILE THEY STAYED IN PANAMA CITY, I WANDERED ABOUT IN THE
RAIN FOREST, SOMETIMES LIVING OFF THE LAND.
WHEN I EMERGED AND RETURNED TO CIVILIZATION, THE LATE, GREAT ANTHROPOLOGIST REINA TORRES DE ARAUS HAD OUR FAMILY OUT TO HER LOS CUMBRES RESIDENCE
FOR WONDERFUL DINNERS. AFTERWARD, SHE NEVER SERVED COFFEE, JUST CAMOMILE TEA. I
CONFESS THAT BACK THEN I DIDN'T APPRECIATE HOW MUCH SENSE IT MADE TO END A
MEAL WITH THIS WONDERFUL BEVERAGE.
NOW I KNOW BETTER. CAMOMILE IS WHAT HERBALISTS CALL A CARMINATIVE, THAT IS, A
STOMACH SOOTHER, AND IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR INDIGESTION. IT'S ALSO SEDATIVE. IN LATIN
AMERICA, SOME PEOPLE DRINK CAMOMILE TEA BEFORE BEDTIME TO HELP THEM SLEEP.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INDIGESTION
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP SOOTHE A TROUBLED TUMMY. HERE
ARE SEVERAL THAT I RECOMMEND.
VVV CAMOMILE {MATRICARIA RECUTITA). COMMISSION £, THE GERMAN GROUP
OF SCIENTISTS THAT MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON HERBAL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS, CONSIDERS CAMOMILE EFFECTIVE FOR RELIEVING MANY GASTROINTESTINAL COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING INDIGESTION. ANDREW WEIL, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE,
SAYS THAT THE BEST HOME REMEDIES FOR UPSET STOMACH ARE CAMOMILE AND PEPPERMINT TEA. PERSONALLY, I PREFER PEPPERMINT, BUT BOTH ARE EFFECTIVE.
WHILE DRINKING CAMOMILE TEA IS FINE, THE TINCTURE IS PROBABLY MORE EFFECTIVE. CAMOMILE TEA HAS ONLY 10 TO 15 PERCENT OF THE HERB'S CARMINATIVE ESSENTIAL OIL, WHILE TINCTURES PREPARED WITH 100-PROOF ALCOHOL HAVE MUCH MORE.
VVV PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). MOST HERBALISTS, MYSELF INCLUDED,
HAVE A SPECIAL REGARD FOR PEPPERMINT'S ABILITY TO RELIEVE INDIGESTION. I'VE NEEDED
PEPPERMINT MORE OFTEN SINCE 1990, WHEN THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION
(FDA) GAVE ME A BAD CASE OF INDIGESTION BY RULING THAT PEPPERMINT IS INEFFECTIVE
FOR STOMACH DISTRESS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT PEPPERMINT IS USELESS. FRANKLY, IT
MEANS THAT THE FDA'S EVALUATION WAS USELESS.
COMMISSION E ENDORSES PEPPERMINT TEA FOR TREATING INDIGESTION. GIVEN A
CHOICE BETWEEN AN FDA PRONOUNCEMENT AND A COMMISSION E ENDORSEMENT,
I'D GO FOR THE GERMAN DECISION. THOSE FOLKS DID SOME RESEARCH AND REALLY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT.
275
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
PEPPERMINT TEA WORKS WELL, BUT BEING A NATIVE SON OF ALABAMA, I'M ALSO
PARTIAL TO MINT JULEPS, WHICH, IT TURNS OUT, WORK EVEN BETTER. VARRO TYLER, PH.D.,
DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT
*MT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE,
INDIANA, NOTES THAT MOST OF THE CARMINATIVE OILS IN PEPPERMINT AND OTHER
MINTS ARE RELATIVELY INSOLUBLE IN WATER.
AS A RESULT, MINT TEA DOESN'T CONTAIN
MUCH OF THE PLANT'S STOMACH-SOOTHING
CONSTITUENTS. IT DOES CONTAIN ENOUGH TO
MAKE IT EFFECTIVE, BUT A PEPPERMINT
TINCTURE, WHICH IS MADE WITH ALCOHOL,
CONTAINS MORE. SO IF FOR SOME REASON
YOU DON'T WANT TO DRINK A JULEP, YOU
CAN USE A TINCTURE INSTEAD. FOLLOW THE
PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
VV ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA). ANGELICA ROOT IS GOOD FOR
TREATING INDIGESTION, MILD STOMACH
CRAMPS AND LACK OF APPETITE, ACCORDING
TO COMMISSION E. THE SUGGESTED DAILY
DOSE IS A TEA MADE WITH TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING
WATER, OR UP TO ONE TEASPOON OF TINCTURE.
^ ^ GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). GINGER'S BENEFITS FOR MOTION SICKNESS
AND NAUSEA HAVE BEEN AMPLY PROVEN, SO IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT COMMISSION E APPROVES TAKING TWO GRAMS (ABOUT A TEASPOON) OF GINGER IN TEA FOR INDIGESTION. GINGER CONTAINS CERTAIN CHEMICALS (GINGEROLS AND SHOGAOLS) THAT NOT ONLY
SOOTHE THE GUT BUT ALSO AID DIGESTION BY INCREASING THE WAVELIKE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS (PERISTALSIS) THAT MOVE FOOD THROUGH THE INTESTINE.
VV MARJORAM (ORIGANUM ONITES). THE BRITISH MUNCH ON MARJORAM SANDWICHES TO TREAT INDIGESTION AND USE DILUTE MARJORAM TEA TO RELIEVE COLIC IN INFANTS.
MARJORAM IS AN AROMATIC MINT, SO IT HAS DIGESTION-SOOTHING BENEFITS THAT ARE SIMILAR
TO PEPPERMINT'S.
V CORIANDER (CORIANDRUM SATIVUM). NO WONDER CORIANDER HELPS SOOTHE
INDIGESTION: ITS ESSENTIAL OIL IS CARMINATIVE, ANTISEPTIC, BACTERICIDAL, FUNGICIDAL
AND A MUSCLE RELAXANT. TRADITIONAL HERBALISTS VALUED CORIANDER, ESPECIALLY TO COUNTERACT THE STOMACH-UPSETTING PROPERTIES OF LAXATIVE HERBS SUCH AS BUCKTHORN, CASCARA, RHUBARB AND SENNA. IN AMAZONIA, WILD CORIANDER (ERYNGIUMFOETIDUM), WITH
PYIPEYSLKOLQ
IF I HAD FREQUENT BOUTS OF INDIGESTION, FD
MIX UP SOME OF THIS TINCTURE, WHICH I
GUARANTEE TASTES BETTER THAN MYLANTA. I
HAVE NO RECIPE, SO I JUST MIX MY HERBS ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAPPEN TO HAVE ON HAND.
HERE ARE THE HERBS I INCLUDE: A DASH EACH
OF ANGELICA, ANISE, CAMOMILE, CORIANDER,
FENNEL, GINGER, ROSEMARY AND TURMERIC
WITH TWO DASHES OF ANY OF THE MINTS, ESPECIALLY MARJORAM AND PEPPERMINT. IT'S OKAY
TO LEAVE SOME OUT AND TO ALTER THE MIXTURE
TO SUIT YOUR PERSONAL TASTES.
STEEP THESE HERBS OVERNIGHT IN THE REFRIGERATOR IN A MIXTURE OF ALCOHOL AND WATER
(ONE SHOT OF VODKA PER CUP OF SPRING WATER).
YOU CAN DRINK THIS AS A TEA OR ADD SOME TO
PINEAPPLE JUICE.
276
INDIGESTION
NEARLY THE SAME CHEMISTRY, IS ADDED TO THE DAILY BEAN RATION, PERHAPS TO ALLEVIATE
THE FLATULENCE THE BEANS COULD GENERATE.
V PAPAYA (CARICA PAPAYA) AND PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS).
BOTH OF THESE FRUITS CONTAIN ENZYMES (PROTEOLYTICS) THAT BREAK DOWN PROTEIN. NATUROPATHS AND PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE JUICING FOR HEALTH, AMONG THEM MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMAN'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS,
VEGETABLES AND HERBS, MAINTAIN THAT PAPAYA AND PINEAPPLE JUICE ARE GOOD FOR RELIEVING INDIGESTION. IF THEY'RE RIGHT, YOU SHOULD ALSO GET BENEFITS FROM EATING OTHER
FRUITS THAT CONTAIN PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES, SUCH AS KIWIFRUIT OR SOME FIGS, AFTER MEALS.
IF I HAD CHRONIC INDIGESTION, I MIGHT HAVE THESE FRUITS FOR DESSERT MORE OFTEN.
V RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). AMERICANS OFTEN BELIEVE
THAT HOT SPICES UPSET THE STOMACH. BUT MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD KNOWS
BETTER—THAT HOT SPICES LIKE RED PEPPER HELP SOOTHE IT. RED PEPPER ALSO STIMULATES
DIGESTION.
V ROOIBOS (ASPALATHUS LINEARIS). SOUTH AFRICAN PHYSICIANS RECOMMEND
ROOIBOS (PRONOUNCED ROO-UI-BUS) TEA AS AN EFFECTIVE STOMACH SOOTHER THAT'S GENTLE
ENOUGH TO TREAT INFANT COLIC, ACCORDING TO THE LATE ECONOMIC BOTANIST JULIA MORTON,
D.SC. (DR. MORTON, AUTHOR OF SOME OF THE BEST BOOKS IN THE FIELD, INCLUDING THE
ATLAS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS OF MIDDLE AMERICA, WAS KILLED IN A CAR CRASH IN 1996. IT
IS A GREAT LOSS FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE STUDY OF MEDICINAL PLANTS.) UNFORTUNATELY, ROOIBOS IS AVAILABLE IN ONLY A HANDFUL OF STORES IN THE UNITED STATES.
V ASSORTED CARMINATIVE HERBS. IF ANYTHING, THERE ARE TOO MANY HERBAL
CARMINATIVES. IN MY DATABASE, I HAVE MORE THAN 500 CARMINATIVE ENTRIES, INCLUDING ALL OF THE PLANTS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER. MOST ARE SUPPORTED BY AT LEAST
SOME RESEARCH. ALSO INCLUDED ARE AGRIMONY, ALLSPICE, APPLES, BASIL, BAY, BEEBALM,
BUCKWHEAT, BURDOCK, CARAWAY, CARDAMOM, CATNIP, CELERY, CHERVIL, CHIVES, CLOVES,
CORIANDER, CUMIN, DILL, FENNEL, GARLIC, HOREHOUND, HYSSOP, LEMON BALM (ALSO KNOWN
AS MELISSA), LEMONGRASS, LOVAGE, MARJORAM, NUTMEG, ONIONS, OREGANO, PARSLEY,
PARSNIPS, PENNYROYAL, ROSEMARY, SAGE, SAVORY, TARRAGON, TEA, THYME, TURMERIC,
VANILLA AND YARROW. FEEL FREE TO TRY ANY OF THESE HERBS TO RELIEVE INDIGESTION.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS OFTEN RECOMMEND A FEW WHIFFS
OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CARMINATIVE OILS TO SETTLE A TROUBLED TUMMY, INCLUDING
ANISEED, BASIL, BERGAMOT, CAMOMILE, CINNAMON, CLOVE, CORIANDER, FENNEL, GARLIC,
GINGER, HYSSOP, JUNIPER, LAVENDER, LEMON, LEMONGRASS, ONION, PEPPERMINT, ROSEMARY, SAGE, SAVORY, TARRAGON AND THYME. DO NOT INGEST THESE OILS, THOUGH, AS SOME
OF THEM CAN BE FATAL IN EVEN SMALL DOSES. THEY ARE MEANT TO BE USED EXTERNALLY.
277
IRATE
I
N THE EARLY 1990S, THERE WAS A RASH OF ARTICLES REPORTING THAT SPERM
COUNTS SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN SIGNIFICANTLY (ABOUT 40 PERCENT) SINCE THE
1930S. WE BEGAN SEEING HEADLINES LIKE THESE:
"FROM SILENT SPRING TO BARREN SPRING" (BUSINESS WEEK)
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR SPERM?" (TIME)
"DOWNWARD MOTILITY: WHEN IT COMES TO SPERM, YOU'RE HALF THE MAN YOUR
GRANDFATHER WAS" (ESQUIRE)
AFTER THESE ALARMING ARTICLES APPEARED, HOWEVER, SOME STUDIES REPORTED
THAT ALL IS WELL AND THE TYPICAL EJACULATE STILL CONTAINS 100 MILLION SPERM, JUST
AS IT DID 60 YEARS AGO. BUT THESE STUDIES HAVE TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST OTHERS REPORTING A SPERM COUNT CLOSER TO 60 MILLION, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE.
IN SEARCH OI SPERM
AMONG OTHER RESPONSES TO THE STUDIES, RESEARCHERS BEGAN ASKING WHAT
COULD BE CAUSING THE DECLINE. SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PESTICIDES AND
OTHER POLLUTANTS ARE ESTROGENIC, MEANING THAT THEY HAVE CHEMICAL EFFECTS THAT
MIMIC THOSE OF THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE. EXPOSE THE MALE OF THE SPECIES TO
ENOUGH ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS FOR LONG ENOUGH, AND YOU GET A FEMINIZATION EFFECT, INCLUDING A LOWER SPERM COUNT.
HERE'S SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT FEMINIZATION IS, IN FACT, TAKING PLACE: IN
LAKE OPOPKA, FLORIDA, THERE WAS A BIG SPILL OF AN ESTROGENIC PESTICIDE IN 1988.
SUBSEQUENTLY, MALE ALLIGATORS DEVELOPED ABNORMALLY SHORT PENISES, REPRODUCTIVE IMPAIRMENT AND FEMALE-LIKE HORMONE LEVELS.
IN THE LOWER COLUMBIA RIVER IN THE NORTHWEST, JUVENILE MALE OTTERS HAVE
TESTICLES THAT ARE ONLY ONE-SEVENTH NORMAL WEIGHT. THEY, TOO, SHOW EVIDENCE OF
EXPOSURE TO ESTROGENIC CHEMICALS.
FLORIDA PANTHERS WERE EXPOSED TO THE ESTROGENIC PESTICIDE DDT FOR YEARS,
AND THEY ATE OTHER ANIMALS THAT WERE EXPOSED. PANTHER FAT HAS HIGH LEVELS OF
DDE, A DDT BREAKDOWN PRODUCT. THE PANTHERS ALSO HAVE UNUSUALLY HIGH
LEVELS OF ABNORMAL SPERM, LOW SPERM COUNTS, UNDESCENDED TESTICLES AND THYROID DYSFUNCTION.
A GROWING NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS ARE CALLING FOR CONTROLS ON ALL OF THESE ESTROGEN-LIKE CHEMICALS. I THINK WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM. BUT GUESS WHO DISAGREES? THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY.
NO SURPRISE THERE. I JUST HOPE THAT WE FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS FALLING SPERM
RTILITY
278
INFERTILITY
COUNT IS REAL, AND IF IT IS, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT TO KEEP THE HUMAN
RACE REPRODUCING.
INFERTILE TERRITORY
INFERTILITY IS NOW GENERALLY DEFINED AS AN INABILITY TO CONCEIVE AFTER SIX
MONTHS TO ONE YEAR OF TRYING. AN ESTIMATED 20 PERCENT OF COUPLES HAVE TROUBLE
CONCEIVING. WHILE IT APPEARS THAT FALLING SPERM COUNTS MAY BE PART OF THE
PROBLEM, RISING MATERNAL AGE IS CERTAINLY A FACTOR, AND AS WOMEN ARE HAVING BABIES LATER IN LIFE, THE RISK OF INFERTILITY RISES.
TREATING INFERTILITY HAS BECOME A HUGE MEDICAL INDUSTRY DURING THE PAST
FEW DECADES, WITH DOCTORS DOING EVERYTHING FROM PRESCRIBING FERTILITY DRUGS TO
ARRANGING FOR TEST-TUBE BABIES (IN VITRO FERTILIZATION). THESE WELL-PUBLICIZED PROCEDURES CAN COST UP TO $10,000 APIECE.
WHILE SOME INFERTILITY PROBLEMS IN WOMEN CAN BE ADDRESSED BY HAVING
CHILDREN EARLIER, MEN NEED TO TRY SOME TACTICS TO RAISE THEIR SPERM COUNTS. THE
FOLLOWING SECTION HIGHLIGHTS PRIMARILY THE NATURAL ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE
HELPFUL FOR MEN.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INFERTILITY
INFERTILITY IS A MAJOR HEARTACHE, AND IT MAY REQUIRE GOING THE HIGH-TECH
ROUTE. BUT BEFORE YOU TRY A HIGH-TECH SOLUTION, YOU'LL WANT TO THOROUGHLY EXPLORE
POSSIBLE CAUSES WITH YOUR DOCTOR TO FIND OUT WHETHER THERE ARE LIFESTYLE OR OTHER
CHANGES THAT YOU CAN MAKE TO IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF CONCEPTION. AND WHILE
YOU'RE AT IT, CONSIDER SOME NATURAL ALTERNATIVES.
W CAULIFLOWER (BRAS SIC A OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING VITAMIN B6 . PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE MICRONUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION OFTEN RECOMMEND VITAMIN B6 FOR INFERTILITY. THE BEST SOURCES OF THIS NUTRIENT, IN DESCENDING
ORDER OF POTENCY, ARE CAULIFLOWER, WATERCRESS, SPINACH, GARDEN CRESS, BANANAS,
OKRA, ONIONS, BROCCOLI, SQUASH, KALE, KOHLRABI, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, PEAS AND
RADISHES.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE)* ACCORDING TO REPORTS OF RESEARCH WITH
ANIMALS IN SAUDI ARABIA, GINGER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SPERM COUNT AND MOTILITY.
I HESITATE TO EXTRAPOLATE ONE ANIMAL STUDY TO HUMANS, BUT GINGER IS SO SAFE AND
TASTY THAT IF I WERE TROUBLED BY A LOW SPERM COUNT OR POOR SPERM MOTILITY, I WOULDN'T
HESITATE TO REACH FOR GINGER TEA, GINGER ALE, GINGERBREAD AND DISHES SPICED WITH
THIS TANGY HERB.
W GINSENG (PANAX GINSENG), CALIFORNIA HERBALIST KATHI KEVILLE, AUTHOR
OF THE ILLUSTRATED HERB ENCYCLOPEDIA AND HERBS FOR HEALTH AND HEALING, TELLS
TWO STORIES OF INFERTILE MEN WHO STARTED TAKING GINSENG, SCHISANDRA AND SAW PAL279
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
METTO TO BUILD UP THEIR PHYSICAL STAMINA. SOME TIME LATER, BOTH OF THEIR WIVES
BECAME PREGNANT.
WHILE I WOULDN'T HANG MY HAT ON THIS ANECDOTE, GINSENG HAS BEEN REVERED
IN ASIA FOR CENTURIES AS A MALE POTENCY AND LONGEVITY TONIC. THERE IS SOME RESEARCH WITH ANIMALS SUGGESTING THAT GINSENG STIMULATES SEXUAL ACTIVITY, AND OF
COURSE, YOU NEED THAT TO CONCEIVE.
VV GUAVA (PSIDIUM, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING
VITAMIN C. FOR TREATMENT OF MALE INFERTILITY CAUSED BY SPERM ABNORMALITIES OR
CLUMPING, VITAMIN C SUPPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS SEVERAL
FERTILITY-ENHANCING DRUGS. MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF
PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND
AUTHOR OF NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS, SUGGESTS TAKING 1,000 MILLIGRAMS A DAY.
(ALTHOUGH THE DAILY VALUE FOR VITAMIN C IS ONLY 60 MILLIGRAMS, TAKING THIS MUCH IS
CONSIDERED SAFE.)
BESIDES GUAVA, OTHER GOOD PLANT SOURCES OF VITAMIN C INCLUDE BITTER MELON,
EMBLIC, ROSEHIPS, BELL PEPPER, RED PEPPERS AND WATERCRESS.
W HERBAL FORMULAS FOR MEN. THE CHINESE HERB CANGZHU (ATRACTYLODES
LANCED) DOMINATES TWO FORMULAS WIDELY PRESCRIBED IN CHINA FOR MALE INFERTILITY.
ONE, CALLED HOCHU-EKKI-TO, CONTAINS 4 GRAMS EACH OF CANGZHU, ASTRAGALUS AND GINSENG; 3 GRAMS OF JAPANESE ANGELICA; 2 GRAMS EACH OF BUPLEURUM ROOT, JUJUBE FRUIT,
CITRUS UNSHIU PEEL (A JAPANESE CITRUS FRUIT); 1.5 GRAMS OF CHINESE LICORICE ROOT; 1
GRAM OF BLACK COHOSH; AND 0.5 GRAM OF GINGER. IN ONE STUDY, THIS FORMULA BOOSTED
SPERM CONCENTRATIONS AND MOTILITY CONSIDERABLY AFTER THREE MONTHS.
A SIMILAR FORMULA CALLED NINJIN-TO CONTAINS THREE GRAMS EACH OF CANGZHU,
GINGER, GINSENG AND CHINESE LICORICE.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EITHER OF THESE FORMULAS, I'D ADVISE AGAINST ATTEMPTING TO
MIX THEM UP YOURSELF. INSTEAD, CONSULT A CHINESE HERBALIST.
W HERBAL FORMULA FOR WOMEN. FOR WOMEN, MAINE HERBALIST DEB
SOULE, FOUNDER OF AVENA BOTANICALS AND AUTHOR OF THE ROOTS OF HEALING, OFFERS
SEVERAL FERTILITY FORMULAS. HERE'S THE ONE SHE SUGGESTS MOST OFTEN: TWO TABLESPOONS EACH OF CHASTEBERRY, CHINESE ANGELICA (ALSO CALLED DANG-QUAI) AND FALSE
UNICORN ROOT AND ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF BLESSED THISTLE STEEPED IN A QUART OF
BOILING WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. SHE SUGGESTS DRINKING TWO TO THREE CUPS A DAY
FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK.
^V JUTE (CORCHORUS OLITORIUS) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING FOLATE.
FOR YEARS, NATUROPATHS HAVE SUGGESTED FOLIC ACID, A B VITAMIN, FOR WOMEN WHO ARE
INFERTILE. AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION IN ATLANTA HAVE
BEEN URGING PREGNANT WOMEN TO GET MORE FOLIC ACID BECAUSE IT PREVENTS SEVERE
SPINAL BIRTH DEFECTS.
280
INFERTILITY
EVERYBODY'S BEEN TOUTING FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTS, BUT I GENERALLY RECOMMEND GETTING NUTRIENTS FROM FOODS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AND THERE ARE A NUMBER
OF FOODS THAT PROVIDE GOOD AMOUNTS OF FOLATE, THE NATURALLY OCCURRING FORM OF
FOLIC ACID. ACCORDING TO MY TRUSTY DATABASE, THE FOOD WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT
OF FOLATE IS EDIBLE JUTE, AT 32 PARTS PER MILLION ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. THIS IS
FOLLOWED BY SPINACH, ENDIVE, ASPARAGUS, PARSLEY, OKRA, PIGWEED AND CABBAGE.
NOTING THAT MANY OF THESE SAME PLANTS ARE WELL-ENDOWED WITH ZINC, WHICH
IS CRITICAL TO MALE REPRODUCTIVE VITALITY, I SUGGEST THAT THIS SAME ASSORTMENT OF
VEGETABLES MIGHT ALSO HELP THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.
VV SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING ZINC.
SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT ZINC DEFICIENCIES MAY BE TIED TO MALE INFERTILITY
AND POOR SPERM QUALITY. GOOD SOURCES OF ZINC INCLUDE SPINACH, PARSLEY, COLLARDS, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CUCUMBERS, STRING BEANS, ENDIVE, COWPEAS, PRUNES AND
ASPARAGUS. SIMMER MOST OF THESE TOGETHER IN A BIG POT, AND YOU'VE GOT THE MAKINGS OF A GOOD SOUP.
V V SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING
ARGININE. NATUROPATHS OFTEN RECOMMEND SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THE AMINO ACID
ARGININE FOR MEN WITH LOW SPERM COUNTS. THEY CALL FOR GETTING FOUR GRAMS OF ARGININE A DAY. THAT'S THE AMOUNT FOUND IN ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS.
SUNFLOWER SEEDS ARE THE HIGHEST ENTRY FOR ARGININE IN MY DATABASE AT 8.2
PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. OTHER HERBS RICH IN THIS VITAL NUTRIENT INCLUDE
CAROB, BUTTERNUTS, WHITE LUPINES, PEANUTS, SESAME SEEDS, SOYBEANS, WATERCRESS,
FENUGREEK, MUSTARD, ALMONDS, VELVET BEANS, BRAZIL NUTS, CHIVES, BROAD BEANS
AND LENTILS.
V ASHWAGANDA {WUHANIA SOMNIFERA). AYURVEDIC PHYSICIANS FEEL ABOUT
THIS HERB THE WAY THE CHINESE DO ABOUT GINSENG, THAT IT'S A TONIC FOR THE MALE LIBIDO AND SEXUAL FUNCTION, PARTICULARLY ERECTION PROBLEMS.
V BOTTLE GOURD (LAGENARIA SICERARIA) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING
CHOLINE. SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN
CHAPEL HILL HAVE FOUND THAT IN MALE RATS, A DEFICIENCY OF DIETARY CHOLINE, ONE OF
THE B VITAMINS, IS ASSOCIATED WITH INFERTILITY. I HESITATE TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF A
SINGLE STUDY DONE WITH ANIMALS. BUT REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS IN MAMMALS ARE MORE
SIMILAR THAN DIFFERENT, AND GETTING A LITTLE EXTRA CHOLINE PROBABLY CAN'T HURT.
IN MY DATABASE, FRUITS OF THE BOTTLE GOURD, A WHITE-FLOWERED VINE SUGGESTIVE OF
GOURDS, ARE HIGHEST IN CHOLINE AT 1.6 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. OTHER GOOD
HERBAL SOURCES OF CHOLINE INCLUDE FENUGREEK LEAVES AND SHEPHERD'S PURSE. THE FOLLOWING RUN WELL BEHIND IN THE AMOUNT OF CHOLINE THEY CONTAIN BUT ARE STILL WORTH
MENTIONING: GINSENG, HOREHOUND, COWPEAS, ENGLISH PEAS, MUNG BEANS, SPONGE
GOURD, LENTILS AND CHINESE ANGELICA.
281
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V OAT (AVENA SATIVA). OATS MAKE HORSES FRISKY AND HAVE LONG BEEN CONSIDERED A MALE SEXUAL ENERGIZER, HENCE OUR PHRASE "SOWING HIS WILD OATS." SOME
HERBALISTS SUGGEST THAT OATS BOOST MALE HUMAN FERTILITY AS WELL. YOU CAN GET OATS
CHEAPLY IN OATMEAL OR MORE EXPENSIVELY IN CONCENTRATED OAT EXTRACTS FOUND IN
MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES.
V RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). RASPBERRY LEAF TEA IS USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO PREGNANT WOMEN TO CALM UTERINE IRRITABILITY. BUT ANIMAL BREEDERS ADD
RASPBERRY LEAVES TO MALE ANIMAL FEED TO INCREASE THEIR FERTILITY. KEVILLE SUGGESTS
THAT INFERTILE MEN TRY RASPBERRY LEAF TEA. THERE'S LITDE OR NO HARM IN IT, AND THE TEA
IS QUITE TASTY.
LMAMMATORY
BOWEL DISEASE
S
HE WAS ONE OF THE SMALLEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANE, AND CLEARLY THE SICKEST AND
WEAKEST-LOOKING. SHE WORE THE INTERNATIONAL EXPEDITION BADGE, WHICH
MEANT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO THE AMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST WITH ME AND SEVERAL OTHER INSTRUCTORS FOR ONE OF OUR WORKSHOPS. QUITE FRANKLY, I FEARED HAVING SOMEONE SO PALE
AND FRAIL-LOOKING IN THE AMAZONIAN HEAT, AND I WONDERED HOW SHE WOULD FARE AFTER
ENDURING A COLD WINTER UP NORTH.
IT WAS A BAD SIGN WHEN SHE PASSED OUT ON THE FLIGHT FROM MIAMI TO IQUITOS, PERU,
COLLAPSING TO THE FLOOR AS SHE MADE HER WAY DOWN THE AISLE TO THE RESTROOM. IT TURNED
OUT THAT THIS WOMAN HAD CROHN'S DISEASE, A SEVERE TYPE OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD), WHICH INVOLVES CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE INTESTINES. (ANOTHER TYPE OF
IBD IS ULCERATIVE COLITIS.)
THIS WOMAN WAS TRYING TO FIT SOME MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES INTO HER LIFE. NOT
KNOWING WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT BRING, SHE FELT AS IF THIS MIGHT BE HER ONLY CHANCE
TO SEE THE AMAZON BEFORE HER CONDITION MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO TRAVEL.
SHE DID GET TO TAKE MY WORKSHOP, AND AFTER WE GOT BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES, SHE CALLED TO THANK ME FOR SOME NATURAL HEALING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
CROHN'S DISEASE THAT I GAVE HER. SHE SAID THAT SHE FELT BETTER. I CERTAINLY HOPE
SHE'S BETTER OFF NOW THAN SHE WAS ON THAT FLIGHT.
WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEM PROBLEMS
ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND CROHN'S DISEASE HAVE SIMILAR SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING
CHRONIC (POSSIBLY BLOODY) DIARRHEA, ABDOMINAL CRAMPS, FATIGUE, WEIGHT LOSS AND
282
INFLAMMATORY BOWE L DISEAS E
SOMETIMES FEVER. BUT THEY HAVE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ORIGINS. SIMPLY PUT, COLITIS
IS INFLAMMATION OF THE COLON, WHILE THE INFLAMMATION OF CROHN'S CAN OCCUR ANYWHERE IN THE INTESTINAL TRACT.
DOCTORS GENERALLY TREAT ANY KIND OF SERIOUS IBD WITH CORTICOSTEROIDS,
MEDICATIONS THAT SOMETIMES SUPPRESS THE INFLAMMATION BUT HAVE SIDE EFFECTS
THAT CAN BE HARD TO LIVE WITH, INCLUDING ACNE, BLURRED VISION AND WEIGHT GAIN.
CORTICOSTEROIDS CAN ALSO CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS THAT MAY BE HARD TO
DISTINGUISH FROM THOSE OF IBD. YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF CORTICOSTEROIDS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVEN'T RUN ACROSS ANY
SURE-FIRE NATURAL THERAPY THAT WORKS, SO I'LL SIMPLY SHARE SOME ALTERNATIVE
APPROACHES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ME.
IN TNE GRIP OF IBD
MOST PEOPLE WITH IBD BECOME ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED OVER IT. THAT'S NO
SURPRISE: IT'S AN ANXIETY-PROVOKING, DEPRESSING ILLNESS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND OTHER STRESS MAY INTENSIFY SYMPTOMS. FD RECOMMEND
GETTING INVOLVED IN A STRESS-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT APPEALS TO YOU, SUCH AS
MEDITATION, BIOFEEDBACK OR YOGA OR SOME OTHER FORM OF MODERATE EXERCISE. MY
PERSONAL STRESS-MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE IS GARDENING AMONG THE HERBS AT MY
HERBAL VINEYARD.
FOOD SENSITIVITIES CAN DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTE TO INTESTINAL PROBLEMS. AN INABILITY TO DIGEST MILK AND DAIRY PRODUCTS (LACTOSE INTOLERANCE) IS WIDESPREAD,
AND MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. I'D RECOMMEND AVOIDING ALL DAIRY FOODS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS TO SEE IF IT HELPS.
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A SIMILAR, THOUGH RARER, INTOLERANCE TO GLUTEN, THE PROTEIN IN WHEAT THAT MAKES BREAD DOUGH SPONGY. MOST OTHER GRAINS, EXCEPT RICE
AND TEFF, A GRAIN USED IN ETHIOPIA, CONTAIN GLUTEN AS WELL. IT'S NOT EASY TO ELIMINATE GRAINS FROM YOUR DIET, BUT IF IBD IS MAKING YOU MISERABLE, I'D SAY IT'S WORTH
THE ADJUSTMENT FOR A FEW WEEKS TO SEE IF YOU FEEL BETTER. TRY SUBSTITUTING RICE
CAKES FOR BREAD AND RICE NOODLES FOR PASTA. OR GO ETHIOPIAN AND ENJOY SOME OF
THEIR GREAT TEFF PANCAKES, IF YOU CAN FIND THE GRAIN IN A NATURAL FOOD STORE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
IF YOU HAVE IBD, YOU SHOULD BE UNDER A DOCTOR'S CARE, BUT FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE HERBAL APPROACHES WITH HIM. HERE ARE SEVERAL THAT CAN HELP
RELIEVE SYMPTOMS.
V ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). IN MY DATABASE, THE TOP COMPOUND WITH ANTI-IBD
EFFECTS IS QUERCETIN, AND THE BEST SOURCE OF THIS COMPOUND IS ONION SKINS. WE DON'F
EAT ONION SKINS, BUT YOU CAN PUT THE WHOLE ONION, SKIN AND ALL, INTO SOUPS AND
I 283
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
' P
JUICING FAR PIGTHW ITEULMI
PEOPLE WHO ADVOCATE JUICING FOR HEALTH SEEM TO HAVE JUICE RECIPES FOR JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT AILS YOU. HERE ARE A FEW JUICING SUGGESTIONS THAT I THINK MAY BE
HELPFUL IN TREATING INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE (IBD).
NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHOR OF THE COMPLETE BOOK OF
JUICING, SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE WITH IBD TRY ONE OR MORE OF HIS FRUIT AND VEGETABLE
DRINKS A DAY. THESE CAN BE MADE IN A BLENDER OR JUICER. (I PREFER TO USE A BLENDER.)
MURRAY'S GREEN DRINK: TWO APPLES, TWO KALE LEAVES, A HANDFUL OF SPINACH AND
SOME PARSLEY AND WHEATGRASS.
MURRAY'S CLEANSING COCKTAIL: ONE APPLE, ONE-HALF BEET WITH TOPS, FOUR CARROTS, TWO CELERY STALKS AND A HALF-CUP OF PARSLEY OR WHEATGRASS.
MURRAY'S ENZYMES GALORE: ONE BANANA, ONE-HALF MANGO, TWO ORANGES, ONEHALF PAPAYA AND A QUARTER OF ONE FRESH PINEAPPLE.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH MURRAY'S GREEN DRINK AND CLEANSING COCKTAIL. I CAN'T
SWEAR THAT THEY'LL RELIEVE IBD, BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY LOADED WITH FLUIDS AND VITAMINS AND MINERALS, WHICH CAN BE DEPLETED IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC DIARRHEA.
IN ENZYMES GALORE, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE BANANA, MANGO, PAPAYA AND
PINEAPPLE. ALL ARE USED EXTENSIVELY IN THE TROPICS FOR DIGESTIVE TROUBLES. THE SPECIAL PROTEIN-DIGESTING ENZYMES IN PINEAPPLE AND PAPAYA (PANCREATIN AND BROMELAIN) HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN CLINICAL STUDIES TO HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTION. THEY
ALSO HAVE ADDED VALUE IN FIGHTING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES.
THE ENZYMES GALORE INGREDIENTS THAT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT ARE THE ORANGES.
SOME ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS COUNSEL AVOIDING CITRUS FRUITS IF YOU HAVE
IBD. YOU CAN TRY ENZYMES GALORE WITH AND WITHOUT THE ORANGES AND SEE WHICH
WORKS BETTER FOR YOU.
STEWS WHILE THEY'RE COOKING. JUST REMOVE THE PARCHMENT-LIKE SKIN AT THE LAST MOMENT BEFORE SERVING.
NATUROPATHS SUGGEST TAKING 400 MILLIGRAMS OF QUERCETIN ABOUT 20 MINUTES
BEFORE EACH MEAL. YOU CAN BUY PURE QUERCETIN AT MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES.
V PSYLLIUM (PLANTAGO OVATA). YOU MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD OF PSYLLIUM
SEEDS, BUT I BET YOU'VE HEARD OF METAMUCIL. METAMUCIL IS A COMMERCIAL FIBER
PRODUCT THAT IS BASICALLY GROUND PSYLLIUM SEEDS AND HUSKS WITH SOME FLAVORING
ADDED. METAMUCIL WORKS AS A LAXATIVE BECAUSE IN THE INTESTINE, THE MUCILAGE IN
PSYLLIUM SEEDS ABSORBS WATER AND SWELLS TO MANY TIMES ITS ORIGINAL SIZE. IT ADDS
BULK TO STOOL AND HELPS STIMULATE THE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS WE EXPERIENCE AS "THE
URGE."
284
INFLAMMATORY BOWE L DISEAS E
PSYLLIUM'S ABILITY TO ABSORB FLUIDS ALSO MAKES IT USEFUL FOR TREATING DIARRHEA, A
COMMON IBD SYMPTOM. IN ADDITION, AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH THE DIGESTIVE TRACT, THE MUCILAGE IN PSYLLIUM EXERTS A SOOTHING EFFECT, WHICH MAY HELP RELIEVE THE CRAMPING OF
IBD. IF YOU USE PSYLLIUM, MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALSO DRINK PLENTY OF FLUIDS. ALSO WATCH
HOW YOU REACT TO IT IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES. IF ALLERGIC SYMPTOMS DEVELOP AFTER YOU TAKE
IT ONCE, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, SUGGESTS USING ASTRINGENT HERBS CONTAINING TANNIN, SUCH AS TEA, FOR RELIEVING GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS. BESIDES PLAIN
BEVERAGE TEA, SEVERAL COMMON HERBS ARE RICH IN TANNIN, INCLUDING BAYBENY, BUGLEWEED, BILBERRY, BLACK WALNUT, ENGLISH WALNUT, CAROB AND RASPBERRY.
V VALERIAN (VALERIANA OFFICINALIS). AN ITALIAN STUDY SUGGESTS THAT VALERIAN IS A USEFUL ADDITION TO OTHER MEDICINES THAT RELIEVE SPASMS IN SMOOTH MUSCLES SUCH AS THE INTESTINE. VALERIAN ALSO HELPS RELIEVE STRESS, WHICH APPARENTLY
CONTRIBUTES TO IBD.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS RECOMMEND MASSAGE WITH A
FEW DROPS OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ESSENTIAL OILS DILUTED IN A FEW TABLESPOONS OF VEGETABLE OIL: BASIL, BERGAMOT, CAMOMILE, CINNAMON, GARLIC, GERANIUM, HYSSOP,
LAVENDER, LEMONGRASS, ROSEMARY, THYME AND YLANG-YLANG. I CAN'T VOUCH FOR THEM
PERSONALLY, BUT MASSAGE IS RELAXING, AND USING ESSENTIAL OILS MAKES IT EVEN MORE
RELAXING. RELAXATION HELPS RELIEVE THE STRESS OF HAVING IBD. I'D TRY THIS APPROACH.
(REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT ESSENTIAL OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.)
V ASSORTED HERBS. HERBALISTS I TRUST RECOMMEND CAMOMILE, PEPPERMINT
AND WILD YAM TO HELP RELIEVE MUSCLE SPASMS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE INTESTINE.
NOTED BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK,
SUGGESTS TREATING IBD WITH A COMBINATION HERBAL COCKTAIL OF TWO PARTS BAYBENY
AND ONE PART EACH OF CAMOMILE, MUGWORT, PEPPERMINT, VALERIAN AND WILD YAM.
HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, RECOMMENDS SEVERAL
HERBS FOR TREATING ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND CROHN'S DISEASE, INCLUDING FENUGREEK,
GENTIAN, GINGER, GOLDENSEAL, LICORICE ROOT, MYRRH GUM AND PAPAYA LEAF.
285
INHIBITED SEXUAL DESIRE
IN WOMEN
A
CERTAIN PHYSICIAN, WHOM I DON'T CARE TO NAME, HAS WRITTEN A BOOK
ABOUT A GREAT MANY HERBS THAT ARE PURPORTED TO BE APHRODISIACS. THIS
WOMAN IS A BIG FAN OF DAMIANA, AN HERB OF MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWEST THAT HAS
SUCH A LONG AND PERSISTENT FOLK HISTORY OF USE AS A SEX STIMULANT THAT ONE LATIN
NAME USED FOR IT IS TURNERA APHRODISIACA.
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT IT: "MEXICAN SEFIORITAS HAVE LONG
DRUNK DAMIANA TEA A COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE BED TO PRIME THEMSELVES FOR THEIR
MEN. IT IS ALSO REPORTED TO INDUCE EROTIC DREAMS WHEN DRUNK AT BEDTIME."
LOVE TOR SALE
THIS PARTICULAR DOCTOR IS NOT THE ONLY AUTHORITY TO TOUT DAMIANA FOR ENHANCING THE SEX DRIVE. FVE HEARD SEX THERAPISTS TALK IT UP AS WELL, SAYING IT IS A
MILD MOOD ENHANCER THAT BECKONS LOVERS TO THE BEDROOM.
« STATEMENTS LIKE THOSE SHOULD SELL A LOT OF DAMIANA, AND
*$&. THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM. YOU SEE, THE DOCTOR IN QUESTION
S3*9 PROBABLY STANDS TO GAIN FROM SALES OF THIS HERB.
IN NEARLY EVERY ISSUE OF ONE PROFESSIONAL JOURNAL,
HER PICTURE APPEARS ALONG WITH A PICTURE OF A
DAMIANA PRODUCT. THE AD SAYS: "IN MY PRACTICE I
HAVE FOUND DAMIANA TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE APHRODISIACS AVAILABLE TO WOMEN. I'VE HAD
GREAT SUCCESS WITH DAMIANA IN A NUMBER OF
CASES. IT'S SAFE AND EFFECTIVE."
NOW, THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY WRONG WITH
SELLING A PRODUCT THAT YOU BELIEVE IN. BUT WHEN
DOCTORS TOUT CONTROVERSIAL APHRODISIACS AND ALSO
SELL THEM, IT MAKES YOU WONDER.
AND DAMIANA IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL. MANY
PHARMACOGNOSISTS (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACISTS),
INCLUDING VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY
AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, INSIST THAT DESPITE ITS LATIN
NAME, DAMIANA'S ALLEGED SEX-STIMULATING VALUE IS A HOAX.
THIS CONTROVERSIAL HERB FROM
THE SOUTHWEST HAS WON A
REPUTATION AS A SEX
STIMULANT.
286
INHIBITED SEXUAL DESIRE IN WOME N
PERSONALLY, I'M UNDECIDED ON DAMIANA. THERE'S NO REAL RESEARCH TO SUPPORT
ITS APHRODISIAC REPUTATION, BUT NOT SO LONG AGO I SPOKE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN WHO
MENTIONED THAT THE HERB HAD BEEN VERY GOOD FOR HER. HER PARTNER ALSO PRAISED
THE HERB.
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS ANY REPORTS OF DAMIANA TOXICITY, SO IF YOU WANT TO TRY
IT, GO AHEAD. THE YOUNG WOMAN I SPOKE TO WAS USING A TEA MADE WITH ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. IT SHOULD BE FINE AT THAT DOSE.
TBU LOSE THE INCLINATION
ANYONE, MAN OR WOMAN, CAN LOSE INTEREST IN SEX. IN WOMEN, THE CONDITION
USED TO BE CALLED FRIGIDITY, BUT SEX THERAPISTS HAVE DROPPED THAT JUDGMENTAL
TERM IN FAVOR OF THE MORE NEUTRAL TERMS LOSS OF LIBIDO OR INHIBITED SEXUAL DESIRE.
MANY FACTORS CAN CAUSE LOSS OF DESIRE, INCLUDING ILLNESS, INJURY, EMOTIONAL
STRESS (ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A RELATIONSHIP IS ON THE ROCKS), ALCOHOL AND MANY PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, PARTICULARLY ANTIDEPRESSANTS. I SUGGEST THAT BEFORE YOU GO TO
A PSYCHOTHERAPIST OR WRITE YOURSELF OFF AS ASEXUAL, MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE MEDICATIONS
THAT YOU TAKE, BOTH PRESCRIPTION AND OVER-THE-COUNTER. THEN TAKE THE LIST TO YOUR
DOCTOR OR PHARMACIST AND ASK IF ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS HAVE SIDE EFFECTS THAT
COULD BE AFFECTING YOUR SEX LIFE. IF SO, ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN SUBSTITUTE OTHER
MEDICATIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE A LESS DASTARDLY EFFECT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INHIBITED SEXUAL DESIRE
ONCE YOU'VE RULED OUT COMMON CAUSES OF LIBIDO LOSS, THEN YOU MIGHT TRY
SOME HERBAL APPROACHES.
"W CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS)* THE CHINESE SAY THAT THIS
HERB, ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI, DOES FOR WOMEN WHAT GINSENG DOES FOR MEN—IT'S
AN ALL-PURPOSE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TONIC.
BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION AS A SEX ENHANCER, CHINESE ANGELICA IS ONE OF THE
MOST WIDELY USED HERBS IN CHINESE WOMEN'S MEDICINE. TYPICALLY, THREE TO SIX
TEASPOONS OF POWDERED ROOT ARE ADDED TO A PINT OF BOILING WATER. WOMEN DRINK
UP TO THREE CUPS OF THE TEA A DAY. (DO NOT TAKE THIS HERB IF YOU ARE PREGNANT,
HOWEVER.)
W GINSENG (PANAX, VARIOUS SPECIES). EVEN THOUGH GINSENG HAS LONG
BEEN CONSIDERED AN APHRODISIAC FOR MEN, I'VE READ REPORTS OF WOMEN WHO FELT
GREATER SEXUAL RESPONSIVENESS AFTER CONSUMING IT.
NOWADAYS, SEVERAL HERBALISTS I KNOW SUGGEST GINSENG FOR LOSS OF SEXUAL DESIRE IN WOMEN. THIS HERB IS VERY EXPENSIVE, SO FEW PEOPLE TAKE VERY MUCH. THE
TYPICAL DOSE IS A HALF-TEASPOON OR SO OF TINCTURE IN JUICE.
287
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VV QUEBRACHO (ASPIDOSPERMA QUEBRACHO-BIANCO). THIS HERB IS ONE
OF THE MORE FAMOUS APHRODISIACS IN SOUTH AMERICA. IT CONTAINS YOHIMBINE, THE ACTIVE COMPOUND IN THE HERB YOHIMBE. I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF YOHIMBE AND QUEBRACHO AS MALE APHRODISIACS, BUT ATLANTA SEX THERAPIST ROGER LIBBY, PH.D., AUTHOR
OF SEX FROM AAH TO ZIPPER: A DELIGHTFUL GLOSSARY OF LOVE, LUST AND LAUGHTER, SAYS
HE ENCOURAGES WOMEN WITH LOW SEXUAL DESIRE TO EXPLORE BOTH OF THESE HERBS.
THE BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE PLANT MEDICINES, ACCORDING TO DR.
LIBBY, CONTRIBUTE TO THE CLITORIS BECOMING ENGORGED WITH BLOOD, LEADING TO INCREASED SEXUAL DESIRE AND MORE SUSTAINED AROUSAL. BUT DON'T TRY THIS HERB IF YOU
HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS, SUCH AS DIZZINESS, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
VV YOHIMBE (PAUSINYSTALIA YOHIMBE). IF DR. LIBBY IS RIGHT, THIS HERB
DOES MORE THAN SIMPLY RAISE ERECTIONS IN MEN. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAS APPROVED PHARMACEUTICALS BASED ON YOHIMBINE FOR ERECTION ENHANCEMENT.
IF THIS HERB INCREASES BLOOD FLOW INTO THE PENIS, AND IT REPORTEDLY DOES, I
COULD IMAGINE IT DOING THE SAME FOR THE CLITORIS.
TAKING THE HERB YOHIMBE IS PROBLEMATIC, AS IT CAN CAUSE A NUMBER OF SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES IN WHICH I
RECOMMEND TAKING THE COMPOUND (YOHIMBINE) THAT'S DERIVED FROM THE HERB INSTEAD. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY YOHIMBINE, YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR A PRESCRIPTION. AND YOU'LL HAVE TO DO A LITTLE EXPLAINING, BECAUSE THIS COMPOUND IS USUALLY
PRESCRIBED TO MEN. IT MIGHT HELP TO TAKE THIS BOOK WITH YOU WHEN YOU ASK.
V ANISE (PIMPINEUA ANI&UM). ANISE IS HIGH IN ANETHOLE, A COMPOUND WITH
EFFECTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE ESTROGEN. IT HAS A FOLK REPUTATION
FOR INCREASING MILK SECRETION, PROMOTING MENSTRUATION, FACILITATING CHILDBIRTH AND
INCREASING LIBIDO IN WOMEN. SOME SCIENTISTS SAY THAT ESTROGEN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
SEX DRIVE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT PLANT ESTROGENS (PHYTOESTROGENS) ENHANCE LUST FOR LIFE—
AND PLAIN OLD LUST AS WELL.
V CHOCOLATE (THEOBROMA CACAO). CHOCOLATE REALLY CAN BOOST LEVELS OF
BODY CHEMICALS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, ACCORDING TO DEBRA WATERHOUSE, AUTHOR
OF WHY WOMEN CRAVE CHOCOLATE. THESE INCLUDE THE NEUROTRANSMITTER SEROTONIN
AND ENDORPHINS, WHICH RELIEVE PAIN AND BOOST MOOD. THE RESULT, SHE BELIEVES, IS
THAT "ALL BRAIN CHEMICALS ARE POSITIONED AT OPTIMAL LEVELS FOR POSITIVE MOODS AND
RENEWED ENERGY." CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS NOTES THAT "CHOCOLATE MAY
MIMIC MARIJUANA IN THE BRAIN." I WOULDN'T PUSH THIS TOO FAR, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH A LITDE CHOCOLATE BEFORE SEX. HOW SWEET IT IS.
V COLA (COLA NITIDA). COLA IS USED AS AN APHRODISIAC IN JAMAICA AND TRA288
INHIBITED SEXUAL DESIRE IN WOME N
DITIONAL WEST AFRICAN SOCIETIES. THE HERB CONTAINS THE STIMULANT COMPOUNDS THEOBROMINE AND KOLANIN AS WELL AS CAFFEINE. COFFEE—WHICH IS, OF COURSE, HIGH IN CAFFEINE—HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A SEX STIMULANT IN THE ARAB WORLD FOR CENTURIES.
V EPIMEDIUM (EPIMEDIAM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS DELICATE HERB
WITH NARROW, HEART-SHAPED LEAVES IMPROVED THE SEXUAL FUNCTION OF MALE ANIMALS IN MANY EXPERIMENTS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D.,
AND ARKANSAS HERBALIST STEVEN FOSTER. IT HAS MODERATE ANDROGEN-LIKE EFFECTS.
SINCE ANDROGENS, WHICH ARE SEX HORMONES, ARE INVOLVED IN SEXUAL DESIRE IN
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, THIS HERB MIGHT STIMULATE SEXUAL DESIRE IN WOMEN WHO
ARE ANDROGEN-DEFICIENT.
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE CHINESE CALL IT YIN-YANG—BECAUSE IT GIVES MALE HORMONES TO WOMEN. I'D EXPERIMENT WITH MAKING A TEA OF ONE TO FIVE TEASPOONS OF
DRIED HERB AND DRINK NO MORE THAN ONE CUP A DAY. FEW AMERICANS, INCLUDING
MYSELF, HAVE FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THIS HERB, BUT THE LEAVES ARE EATEN AS
FOOD IN ASIA.
ALTHOUGH THE HERB IS IMPORTED INTO THIS COUNTRY, IT IS NOT YET WIDELY AVAILABLE, SO YOU MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY LOCATING IT. I EXPECT IT TO BECOME MUCH
MORE POPULAR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
V FENNEL (FOENICULUM VULGARE). FENNEL INCREASES THE LIBIDO OF BOTH
MALE AND FEMALE RATS, ACCORDING TO THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER. FENNEL HAS COMPOUNDS THAT ACT LIKE THE FEMALE HORMONE ESTROGEN AND HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO PROMOTE MILK FLOW IN NURSING WOMEN.
YOU MIGHT EXPERIMENT WITH IT AS A LIBIDO ENHANCER. DON'T USE FENNEL OIL, HOWEVER.
IN PREGNANT WOMEN, THE OIL CAN CAUSE MISCARRIAGE. AND IN DOSES GREATER THAN
ABOUT A TEASPOON, IT CAN BE TOXIC.
V FENUGREEK (TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM). ONCE FED TO HAREM
WOMEN TO MAKE THEM MORE BUXOM, FENUGREEK HAS ESTROGEN-LIKE (ESTROGENIC)
ACTIVITY THAT MAY INCREASE BREAST SIZE AND AID IN MILK PRODUCTION FOR NURSING
MOTHERS. LYDIA PINKHAM'S COMPOUND—THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TONIC—CONTAINED FENUGREEK SEEDS ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER HERBS AND
ALCOHOL.
MODERN DOCTORS MAY SCOFF AT LYDIA PINKHAM'S, BUT THEY DO PRESCRIBE ESTROGEN TO WOMEN WHO ARE GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE. ONE OF THE THINGS ESTROGEN
DOES IS HELP WITH VAGINAL DRYNESS, THUS MAKING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE MORE COMFORTABLE. LET'S FACE IT, PAINFUL INTERCOURSE IS BOUND TO INHIBIT SEXUAL DESIRE. (IT
LOOKS LIKE LYDIA PINKHAM'S WAS DECADES AHEAD OF HORMONE REPLACEMENT
THERAPY.)
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). ON A TRIP TO PERU, I FOUND WOMEN IN THE
I 289
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
MARKETPLACE SELLING "HOT" GINGER TO WARM UP "COLD" WOMEN. I CAN'T MAKE ANY
SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS FOR THIS ONE, BUT GINGER PROBABLY DOES NO HARM, AND IT'S TASTY, SO
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY.
V PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CRI&PUM). LIKE FENUGREEK, PARSLEY IS ESTROGENIC AND HAS A FOLK HISTORY OF USE IN PROMOTING MENSTRUATION AND MILK PRODUCTION, FACILITATING CHILDBIRTH AND INCREASING THE FEMALE LIBIDO.
V SAW PALMETTO {SERENOA REPENS). NINETEENTH-CENTURY HERBALISTS RECOMMENDED SAW PALMETTO TO HELP RESTORE LIBIDO IN WOMEN. TODAY THE HERB IS USED
PRIMARILY BY MEN TO SHRINK ENLARGED PROSTATE GLANDS.
SOME RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE COMPOUND BETA-SITOSTEROL, WHICH IS
FOUND IN THIS HERB, HAS APHRODISIAC EFFECTS, ACCORDING TO THE LATE JULIA MORTON,
D.SC, ECONOMIC BOTANIST AND AUTHOR OF THE ATLAS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS OF MIDDLE
AMERICA. YOU CAN BUY SAW PALMETTO TINCTURE AND CAPSULES AT HERB SHOPS AND
HEALTH FOOD STORES.
V WILD YAM (DIOSCOREA VILLOSA). SUSUN WEED, AN HERBALIST SPECIALIZING
IN WOMEN'S HEALTH AND AUTHOR OF BREAST CANCER? BREAST HEALTH! MAKES SALVES OUT
OF THE WILD YAM AND GIVES THEM TO WOMEN EXPERIENCING POSTMENOPAUSAL VAGINAL
DRYNESS. SHE AND OTHER HERBALISTS SAY IT HELPS. WILD YAM CONTAINS ESTROGEN PRECURSORS. YOU CAN MAKE A SALVE BY WHIRRING THE INNER PORTION OF THE YAM IN A
BLENDER AND ADDING IT TO A COMMERCIAL VAGINAL LUBRICANT.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS RECOMMEND WHOLE-BODY MASSAGE WITH OILS OF CLARY, JASMINE, ROSE OR YLANG-YLANG IN A VEGETABLE OIL BASE FOR LOSS
OF LIBIDO IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. EVEN WITHOUT AROMATIC OILS, MASSAGE CAN BE
SEXUALLY STIMULATING. BUT I'M PREPARED TO BELIEVE THAT ADDING AN AROMATIC OIL TO A
STIMULATING MASSAGE CAN BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE. (REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT ESSENTIAL OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.)
W E T BITES AND STINGS
S
AY "INSECT REPELLENT," AND THE BRAND NAMES THAT JUMP INTO MOST
PEOPLE'S MINDS ALL CONTAIN A CHEMICAL WITH A NAME THAT'S SO LONG, ONLY A
CHEMIST COULD PRONOUNCE IT. THE REST OF US CALL IT DEET.
I CONFESS I'M MUCH OPPOSED TO DEET. IT DISSOLVES MY PLASTIC GLASSES, AND
ONCE ON THE SKIN, IT QUICKLY PASSES THROUGH THE SKIN INTO THE BLOODSTREAM,
WHERE I DON'T WANT SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS WITH TONGUE-TWISTER NAMES.
290
INSECT BITES AND STINGS
IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN SOME PLACES, DEET IS BANNED ALTOGETHER.
AT THE AMAZONIAN CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CAMP
ON THE NAPO RIVER OF PERU WHERE I CONDUCT SOME OF MY WORKSHOPS, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY PROHIBIT ANY USE OF DEET. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS EFFECT ON
PEOPLE. THEY'VE BANNED THE CHEMICAL BECAUSE IT SPEEDS THE DETERIORATION OF
THE SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT HOLD UP THE CANOPY WALKWAY THAT MEANDERS THROUGH
THE TREE BRANCHES, SOMETIMES 100 FEET ABOVE THE FOREST FLOOR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR REPELLING INSECTS
OF COURSE, WHILE I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR DEET, I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR BUGS
EITHER. I'VE SPENT YEARS TRYING OUT VARIOUS HERBAL INSECT REPELLENTS, AND I HAVE
REASONABLY GOOD NEWS TO REPORT.
V W MOUNTAIN MINT (PYCNANTHEMUM MUTICUM) AND PENNYROYAL
(MENTHA PULEGIIIM OR HEDEOMA PULEGIOIDES). BOTH OF THESE HERBS CONTAIN
PULEGONE, A POWERFUL INSECT REPELLENT. PENNYROYAL IS THE MORE POPULAR OF
THE TWO, AND IT HAS A LONG AND HONORABLE HISTORY.
PLINY NOTICED IN THE FIRST CENTURY A.D. THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE AGAINST FLEAS. IN FACT, THIS HERB'S INSECT-REPELLING ACTION IS INCORPORATED INTO ITS SCIENTIFIC
NAME: PULEGIUM MEANS "FLEA" IN LATIN. YOU CAN
FIND PENNYROYAL IN MANY COMMERCIAL HERB-BASED INSECT REPELLENTS.
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, MOUNTAIN
MINT WORKS BETTER THAN PENNYROYAL. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH MOUNTAIN MINT, JUST PICK SOME LEAVES
AND RUB THEM ON YOUR SKIN AND CLOTHING. (BUT DON'T
USE PENNYROYAL OR MOUNTAIN MINT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, AS THE INGREDIENTS IN THESE HERBS HAVE BEEN
KNOWN TO INCREASE THE RISK OF MISCARRIAGE.)
^V BASIL (OCIMUM BASILI-CUM). BASIL IS
MAINLY A SPICE IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ELSEWHERE IT IS
USED EXTENSIVELY IN MEDICINE, PARTICULARLY IN INDIA. INDIANS RUB THE LEAVES ON
THEIR SKIN AS AN INSECT REPELLENT, AND AFRICANS DO THE SAME. IF I WERE BOTHERED
BY BUGS IN MY GARDEN AND SOME OF MY CULINARY BASIL WAS CLOSE AT HAND, I MIGHT
RUB SOME ON AS AN IMPROMPTU INSECT REPELLENT.
VV CITRONELLA (CYMBOPOGON, VARIOUS SPECIES). A LEMON-SCENTED PLANT
FROM ASIA, CITRONELLA HAS LONG BEEN USED AS AN INSECT REPELLENT. IT'S OFTEN SOLD IN
CANDLES THAT ARE BURNED TO DRIVE OFF MOSQUITOES. IT'S ALSO THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN
SEVERAL NON-DEET COMMERCIAL INSECT REPELLENTS THAT YOU CAN APPLY TO EITHER YOUR
SKIN OR YOUR CLOTHING.
PENNYROYAL
PENNYROYAL HAS BEEN CALLED
JLEABANE, TICKTVEED AND
MOSQUITO PLANT BECAUSE OF
ITS POWER TO REPEL INSECTS.
291
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
AS WITH MANY ESSENTIAL OILS, PURE CITRONELLA OIL CAN BE IRRITATING TO THE SKIN
(AND IT SHOULD NEVER BE INGESTED). IF YOU WANT TO USE THE OIL, YOU'LL HAVE TO DILUTE IT BY ADDING SEVERAL DROPS TO A VEGETABLE OIL BASE. YOU CAN RUB THE DILUTED
OIL DIRECTLY ON YOUR SKIN.
—| THE KNOCK ON CITRONELLA IS THAT ITS
PROTECTION WEARS OFF FASTER THAN
DEETS. IN ONE EXPERIMENT, CITRONELLA
OIL REPELLED THE MOSQUITO THAT CARRIES
YELLOW FEVER FOR ONLY A LITTLE OVER AN
HOUR, SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD USE DEET
IF YOU LIVE IN AN EXOTIC AREA WHERE
YELLOW FEVER IS STILL A PROBLEM. BUT FOR
AMERICAN BACKYARDS, CITRONELLA WORKS
REASONABLY WELL.
A WHILE AGO, I RECEIVED A MOST
WELCOME LETTER FROM A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, RACHEL SMITH. I HAD SENT HER
SOME INFORMATION ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS,
INCLUDING CITRONELLA, TO HELP HER WITH
HER SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT, "ESSENTIAL
OILS AS AN ALTERNATIVE PESTICIDE." SHE
WON A PRIZE BASED ON HER DEMONSTRATION THAT CITRONELLA OIL, AND TO A LESSER
DEGREE, TEATREE OIL CONTROLLED APHIDS
ON HER HIBISCUS PLANTS. I WAS NOT SURPRISED.
VV, CITRUS ESSENTIAL OILS. SOMETHING ABOUT CITRUS, AND PLANTS WITH CITRUSLIKE AROMATIC QUALITIES, REPELS
INSECTS. THE CITROSA GERANIUM, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH HAS A STRONG CITRUS SMELL,
HAS 30 TO 40 PERCENT OF THE REPELLENT POWER OF DEET. AND CRUSHED LEMON THYME
(THYMUS CITRIODORA) HAS 62 PERCENT OF DEETS REPELLENCY.
FOR THIS REASON, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY CITRUS-SCENTED ESSENTIAL OILS, INCLUDING THOSE OF CITRUS LEAVES THEMSELVES, WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE USER THAN
DEET. AFTER ALL, OUR ANCESTORS WERE EXPOSED TO CITRUS FRUITS AS THEY EVOLVED.
YOU SURE CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT DEET.
IF YOU WANT TO TRY CITRUS ESSENTIAL OILS, YOU'LL HAVE TO DILUTE THEM FIRST BY
ADDING SEVERAL DROPS TO A VEGETABLE OIL BASE. YOU CAN EXPERIMENT WITH USING A
OUTWITTING BUGS
SINCE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE JUNGLE,
I'VE ALWAYS PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO
KEEPING CREEPY CRAWLY-CRITTERS OFF ME IN THE
FIRST PLACE. HERE ARE A FEW TIPS THAT I'VE
FOUND HELPFUL.
INSECT AUTHORITIES ALWAYS ADVISE
WEARING LONG PANTS AND LONG-SLEEVED
SHIRTS WHEN YOU'RE OUT AND ABOUT IN BUG
AND TICK COUNTRY. IF YOU WANT TO GO THAT
ROUTE, FINE, BUT I CONFESS THAT I DO NOT
WEAR LONG-LIMBED CLOTHING. INSTEAD I WEAR
SHORT PANTS SO THAT I CAN EASILY SPOT ANY
TICKS ON MY LEGS.
WHEN IN BAD TICK COUNTRY, I ALSO
SPRINKLE SULFUR IN MY SOCKS, HAVING
PROVED TO MYSELF THAT THIS WORKS WELL ON
THE RELATED CHIGGERS THAT HAUNTED THE
BLACKBERRY PATCHES WHERE I GREW UP IN
THE CAROLINAS.
I ALSO LEARNED IN PANAMA TO SQUAT ON
MY HAUNCHES, INDIAN-STYLE, RATHER THAN SIT
ON SOME INVITING FALLEN LOG WITH ITS
PLETHORA OF BUGS AND OTHER VERMIN.
292
INSECT BITE S AN D STING S
COUPLE OF ESSENTIAL OILS TOGETHER. YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE AN INSECT REPELLENT THAT WILL ALSO SERVE AS A SCENT THAT IS PLEASING TO YOU. I MEAN THIS FOR
MEN, TOO; MANY MEN'S COLOGNES FEATURE CITRUS SCENTS.
V LEMONGRASS (CYMBOPOGON, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS IS A CLOSE KIN
TO CITRONELLA AND HAS MANY OF THE SAME INSECT-REPELLENT COMPOUNDS. IF YOU HAVE
ACCESS TO THE FRESH HERB, SIMPLY CRUSH SOME AND RUB IT DIRECTLY ON YOUR SKIN.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION AN HERBAL ESSENTIAL OIL COMBINATION THAT I ENCOUNTERED ON A 1995 TRIP TO AMAZONIAN PERU. I WAS AMAZED AT THE
EFFICACY OF A REPELLENT GIVEN TO ME BY NORTH HOLLYWOOD HERBALIST JOHN DUVALL. IT CONTAINED CITRONELLA, LAVENDER AND PENNYROYAL IN A VEGETABLE OIL BASE, AND IT WAS THE
MOST EFFECTIVE REPELLENT TVE EVER WITNESSED FOR THE BUGS DOWN ON THE NAPO RIVER. A
DROP IN THE CENTER OF A SWEATY RED HAT CREATED A BULL'S-EYE—A BRIGHT RED, BUG-FREE
SPOT, SURROUNDED BY A SOLID BROWN HORDE OF SWEAT BEES. THE SHAMAN I WAS WORKING
WITH AT THE TIME, ANTONIO MONTERO, WAS MORE IMPRESSED WITH THE AROMA, SAYING THAT
IT CONTAINED "THE SPIRITS OF THE WORLD."
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE THE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR THIS REPELLENT, BUT YOU
COULD EXPERIMENT BY MIXING SEVERAL DROPS OF EACH OF THESE OILS INTO A VEGETABLE
OIL BASE AND SEE IF YOU FIND A FORMULA THAT WORKS FOR YOU. JUST REMEMBER NEVER
TO INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INSECT BITES ANA STINGS
DOCTORS GENERALLY RECOMMEND PAIN RELIEVERS, ICE PACKS AND MEAT TENDERIZER TO TREAT INSECT BITES AND STINGS. (APPLYING A DAB OF COMMERCIAL MEAT TENDERIZER DIRECTLY TO A STING NEUTRALIZES VENOM.) THESE ARE ALL REASONABLE
APPROACHES. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF GOOD HERBAL ALTERNATIVES.
VV CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS), I'M A FAN OF MAUDE GRIEVE, WHOSE
MODERN HERBAL, WRITTEN IN 1931, IS NOW A CLASSIC IN THE FIELD. GRIEVE WRITES PICTURESQUELY THAT CALENDULA FLOWER "RUBBED ON THE AFFECTED PART, IS AN ADMIRABLE
REMEDY FOR THE PAIN AND SWELLING CAUSED BY THE STING OF A WASP OR BEE." I BELIEVE
HER, AND I WOULD TRY IT IF I WERE STUNG AND HAD SOME FRESH CALENDULA CLOSE AT HAND.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A, CEPA) BOTH GARLIC AND
ONIONS CONTAIN ENZYMES THAT BREAK DOWN CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS
PROSTAGLANDINS THAT THE BODY RELEASES IN RESPONSE TO PAIN.
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, GARLIC AND ONIONS WORK BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. YOU CAN MAKE A POULTICE OF THESE HERBS AND APPLY THEM DIRECTLY TO INSECT BITES AND STINGS. YOU CAN ALSO GET A MEASURE OF RELIEF BY EATING FOODS THAT
CONTAIN THEM.
ONE FURTHER NOTE: ONION SKIN IS AN EXTREMELY GOOD SOURCE OF THE ANTI-ALLERGIC CHEMICAL QUERCETIN, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR RELIEVING INFLAMMATION.
J 293
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
YOU CAN GET THE ADDED BENEFIT OF QUERCETIN BY LEAVING THE SKIN ON WHEN YOU
COOK SOUPS OR STEWS. FISH OUT THE SKIN JUST BEFORE SERVING; IT WILL HAVE RELEASED
A GOOD AMOUNT OF QUERCETIN INTO THE DISH, ALONG WITH A RICH, BROWN COLOR.
VV PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). WHEREVER I GO—FROM THE APPALACHIANS TO THE ANDES TO THE ROCKIES—PLANTAIN IS ONE OF THE FIRST HERBS MY
BOTANICAL FRIENDS MENTION FOR BUG BITE. IT'S THE FIRST THING I APPLY AT HOME, TOO,
SINCE IT IS A COMMON WEED IN MY LAWN. (YOU NEED TO RUB ON THE FRESH HERB FOR THIS
REMEDY TO WORK.)
EDWARD E. SHOOK, AUTHOR OF ADVANCED TREATISE ON HERBOLOGY, TELLS A STORY
ABOUT A WOMAN WHO GOT A BEE STING ON HER HAND, AND HER ENTIRE ARM BEGAN TO
SWELL. HE TOLD HER TO WASH PLANTAIN LEAVES, MAKE A POULTICE AND APPLY IT TO THE
STING. THE NEXT DAY THE WOMAN RETURNED, HEALED. I DIDN'T SEE THIS HAPPEN, BUT I
DO KNOW THAT PLANTAIN IS MANY HERBALISTS' HERB OF CHOICE FOR BEE STINGS.
V ASSORTED HERBS. MY DATABASE ALSO LISTS A FEW OTHER FOLK REMEDIES FOR INSECT BITES AND STINGS: CAMOMILE, FLANDERS POPPY, INDIGO AND ST-JOHN'S-WORT. THE
TYPICAL APPROACH IS TO RUB THE FRESH HERB ON THE SITE OF THE BITE OR STING. NONE OF
THESE WOULD BE MY FIRST CHOICES, BUT IF I WERE CAUGHT WITHOUT THE HERBS DISCUSSED
ABOVE, I'D TRY ANY ONE OF THESE.
INSOMNIA
WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS A HARD TIME GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP. ABOUT
A THIRD OF AMERICANS EXPERIENCE INSOMNIA REGULARLY, AND UP TO TEN
MILLION RELY ON SEDATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS TO HELP THEM FALL ASLEEP. THAT'S A WHOLE
LOT OF SLEEPING PILLS.
INSOMNIA IS A BROAD TERM THAT ENCOMPASSES ANY AND ALL DIFFICULTIES WITH
SLEEP, INCLUDING THE INABILITY TO FALL ASLEEP OR TO STAY ASLEEP.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INSOMNIA
PHARMACEUTICAL SEDATIVES WORK, BUT THEY CAN BECOME ADDICTIVE, AND THEY
INTERFERE WITH NATURAL SLEEP CYCLES. YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT I PREFER
NATURAL ALTERNATIVES, OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL.
W \ LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS)* ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA, LEMON
BALM IS ENDORSED AS BOTH A SEDATIVE AND STOMACH SOOTHER BY COMMISSION E, THE
BODY OF SCIENTISTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERB SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS. THE SEDATIVE ACTION IS ATTRIBUTED LARGELY TO A GROUP OF CHEMICALS IN
294
INSOMNIA
THE PLANT CALLED TERPENES. SEVERAL OTHER HERBS—JUNIPER, GINGER, BASIL AND
CLOVE—ARE BETTER ENDOWED WITH SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS, BUT NONE OF THEM HAS
THE COMBINATION THAT LEMON BALM CONTAINS, AND NONE OF THEM HAS ITS REPUTATION AS A BEDTIME HERB.
I SUGGEST TRYING A TEA MADE WITH TWO TO FOUR TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V*^ VALERIAN (VALERIANA OFFICINALIS). DRINKING A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS OF DRIED VALERIAN ROOT SHORTLY BEFORE BEDTIME WILL PROMOTE SLEEPINESS,
ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E. IN FACT, THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THE TEA SO SAFE THAT
IT ALSO ENDORSES DRINKING IT UP TO SEVERAL
TIMES A DAY TO RELIEVE RESTLESSNESS, ANXIETY
AND NERVOUSNESS.
VALERIAN HAS A FAIRLY RANK AROMA
AND TASTE. IF ITS EARTHINESS IS NOT TO
YOUR LIKING, YOU CAN ALWAYS OPT FOR A
TINCTURE OR CAPSULES INSTEAD.
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THERE
ARE MORE THAN 80 OVER-THE-COUNTER
SLEEP AIDS CONTAINING VALERIAN.
WHY? BECAUSE IT WORKS. IN ONE
STUDY, A COMBINATION OF 160 MILLIGRAMS OF VALERIAN AND 80 MILLIGRAMS OF LEMON BALM EXTRACTS
BROUGHT ON SLEEP AS WELL AS A STANDARD DOSE OF ONE OF THE DRUGS IN THE
VALIUM FAMILY OF PHARMACEUTICALS
(BENZODIAZEPINES).
I SHOULD MENTION HERE THAT
VALIUM IS NOT DERIVED FROM THE HERB
VALERIAN. THERE'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT THE TWO ARE RELATED, PROBABLY
BECAUSE THEY BOTH BEGIN WITH A V.
UNLIKE PRESCRIPTION SLEEP OR ANXIETY MEDICATIONS, VALERIAN IS NOT CONSIDERED HABIT-FORMING, NOR DOES IT PRODUCE A "HANGOVER," AS DO MEDICATIONS IN THE
VALIUM GROUP.
SOME NATUROPATHS I RESPECT SUGGEST THAT YOU TREAT INSOMNIA BY DRINKING
VALERIAN ROOT TEA ABOUT 30 MINUTES BEFORE RETIRING. OTHERS SUGGEST TAKING 150 TO
300 MILLIGRAMS OF A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT (0.8 PERCENT VALERIC ACID). PERSONALLY,
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS.
VALERIAN PRESENTS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO REITERATE MY BELIEF THAT THE
VALERIAN
THE ROOT OF THIS HERB HAS LONG BEEN USED
AS A SEDATIVE, AND ITS THE ACTIVE
INGREDIENT IN MORE THAN 100 OVER-THECOUNTER TRANQUILIZERS AND SLEEP AIDS.
295
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WHOLE HERBAL EXTRACTS USED IN NATURAL MEDICINES OFTEN MAKE MORE SENSE THAN
THE "MAGIC BULLET" HERBAL DERIVATIVES THAT THE DRUG INDUSTRY FAVORS. FOR YEARS
SCIENTISTS BELIEVED THAT ONLY TWO CONSTITUENTS IN VALERIAN, VALEPOTRIATES AND
BORNYL ESTERS, PRODUCED ITS SEDATIVE EFFECT. BUT ONE MORE RECENT ITALIAN STUDY
NOTES THAT OTHER CHEMICALS IN THIS HERB, VALERANONE AND KESSYL ESTERS, ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SLEEP-INDUCING EFFECTIVENESS. THE RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT THE
SEDATIVE EFFECT OF VALERIAN COMES FROM THE ACTIONS OF ITS MANY DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS WORKING IN HARMONY WITH EACH OTHER.
VV LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). IT'S NICE TO SEE LAVENDER
APPROVED BY COMMISSION E FOR INSOMNIA. I'VE SEEN ACCOUNTS OF BRITISH HOSPITALS
USING LAVENDER OIL TO HELP PATIENTS SLEEP AT NIGHT. THE HOSPITALS ADMINISTER THE OIL
EITHER IN A WARM BATH OR SPRINKLED ONTO BEDCLOTHES.
LAVENDER OIL IS ALSO A FAVORITE OF AROMATHERAPISTS, WHO USE IT FOR ALL SORTS
OF AILMENTS, INCLUDING INSOMNIA. SOME COMPONENTS OF LAVENDER OIL AFFECT CELL
MEMBRANES, INTERRUPTING THE INTERACTION OF CELLS WITH EACH OTHER. BECAUSE THE
OIL HELPS TO SLOW NERVE IMPULSES, IT CAN HELP REDUCE IRRITABILITY AND BRING ON
SLEEP. IT ALSO HAS AN ANESTHETIC EFFECT.
BUT BEWARE: NOT ALL LAVENDER IS TRANQUILIZMG. SOME SPECIES, ESPECIALLY SPANISH
LAVENDER, MIGHT HAVE A STIMULATING ACTION SIMILAR TO ROSEMARY'S. WHEN YOU BUY
LAVENDER OIL, BE PREPARED TO TRY IT OUT TO DISCOVER WHETHER IT'S SOOTHING. IF YOU BUY
FROM AN AROMATHERAPIST, SPECIFY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN OIL THAT CAN HELP YOU SLEEP.
IF YOU INADVERTENTLY BUY A LAVENDER OIL THAT HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT, SIMPLY SAVE IT
FOR OTHER USES (YOU'LL FIND MANY IN THIS BOOK). BUT REMEMBER THAT ESSENTIAL OILS ARE INTENDED FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.
^ V PASSIONFLOWER (PASSIFLORA INCAMATA). THIS IS A MILD SEDATIVE, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E. RESPECTED HERBALISTS AROUND THE WORLD AGREE, AMONG
THEM STEVEN FOSTER, A DISTINGUISHED ARKANSAS HERBALIST AND PHOTOGRAPHER AND COAUTHOR OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS.
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, ABOUT 40 OVER-THE-COUNTER SEDATIVE PREPARATIONS
CONTAIN PASSIONFLOWER. BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) BANNED THE USE OF PASSIONFLOWER IN OVER-THE-COUNTER SEDATIVES
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN SAFE AND EFFECTIVE? THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT
WITH THE HERB ITSELF. THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE FDA'S UNREALISTIC AND EXORBITANTLY
EXPENSIVE STANDARD OF PROOF.
BECAUSE OF THIS, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BUY THE KIND OF SAFE, GENDE SLEEPINDUCING PREPARATIONS CONTAINING PASSIONFLOWER THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN
BRITAIN OR GERMANY. BUT YOU CAN BUY THE HERB ITSELF, AS WELL AS HERBAL TINCTURES, AND THESE SHOULD BE SAFE TO USE. FRESH OR DRIED PASSIONFLOWER HAS BEEN
USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT NERVOUS TENSION, ANXIETY AND INSOMNIA.

OPIUM: HISTORY'S FAVORITE SLEEP INDUCER
DO YOU HAVE ANY PRETTY POPPIES GROWING IN YOUR BACKYARD GARDEN? IF THEY'RE LARGE
RED, PURPLE OR WHITE ANNUALS, IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THAT YOU'RE HARBORING ILLEGAL PLANTS.
BECAUSE POPPY PLANTS ARE THE SOURCE OF BOTH OPIUM AND HEROIN, THE U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS MADE IT ILLEGAL TO GROW THEM.
IF YOU'RE AMONG THE "GUILTY," HOWEVER, YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF COMPANY.
THESE POPPIES ARE GROWN AS ORNAMENTALS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. AND OPIUM POPPIES ARE SO GOOD AT SEEDING THEMSELVES THAT THEY'RE HARD TO GET RID OF. (I'VE EVEN
SEEN THEM GROWING ILLEGALLY IN MANY STATE-RUN BOTANICAL GARDENS.)
IF YOU DO HAVE AN ILLEGAL POPPY OR TWO AMONG YOUR PETUNIAS, YOU SHOULD ALSO
KNOW THAT YOU'RE GROWING ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST MEDICINES. THE SLEEP-INDUCING,
PAIN-RELIEVING POWERS OF OPIUM HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. ACCORDING TO A MANUSCRIPT SENT TO ME BY THE FAMOUS HUNGARIAN SCIENTIST PETER
TETENYI, PEOPLE ALONG THE RHINE HAD FIELDS OF OPIUM POPPIES AS LONG AGO AS EARLY
NEOLITHIC TIMES, AROUND 5000 B.C. ALTHOUGH THE SEEDS WERE FIRST USED AS FOOD, THE
SEDATIVE EFFECTS OF THE POD AND LATEX WERE RECOGNIZED QUITE EARLY.
BY THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C., THE ANCIENT GREEKS USED OPIUM
EXTENSIVELY AS MEDICINE. AND BY ABOUT 1000 B.C., THE BEAUTIFUL OPIUM POPPY WAS
BEING USED AS AN ORNAMENTAL FLOWER FROM EUROPE ALL THE WAY TO CHINA.
I CERTAINLY DON'T RECOMMEND TAKING ANY OF THE NARCOTICS DERIVED FROM THE
OPIUM POPPY, EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE PRESCRIBED BY A DOCTOR. BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE AWARE THAT DOCTORS STILL DO MAKE CONSIDERABLE USE OF DRUGS DERIVED FROM THIS
PLANT, INCLUDING CODEINE AND MORPHINE. AND JUST IN CASE YOU'RE CURIOUS, THE
OPIUM USED FOR LEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS COMES FROM POPPY FIELDS IN HOLLAND AND
AUSTRALIA.
J L
V CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE TEA HAS BEEN USED AS A
BEDTIME BEVERAGE FOR CENTURIES. ALTHOUGH ITS REPUTED SEDATIVE EFFECT WAS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN UNTIL THIS DECADE, THE FOLKLORE WAS RIGHT. APIGENIN HAS PROVEN
TO BE ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE SEDATIVE COMPOUNDS IN CAMOMILE. I'D PROBABLY TRY IT AT
BEDTIME, IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY VALERIAN AND LAVENDER HANDY. IT IS A PLEASANT-TASTING
TEA THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY ENJOY.
V CATNIP (NEPETA CATARIA). THE PLANT THAT INTOXICATES MOST CATS ALSO HAS
MILD TRANQUILIZING-HYPNOTIC-SEDATIVE EFFECTS ON MANY PEOPLE. CATNIP CONTAINS
CHEMICALS (NEPETALACTONE ISOMERS) SIMILAR TO THE SEDATIVE CONSTITUENTS OF VALERIAN.
AND BEING A MEMBER OF THE MINT FAMILY, CATNIP TASTES MUCH BETTER THAN VALERIAN.
YOU CAN TRY A CUP OF TEA ABOUT 45 MINUTES BEFORE BEDTIME.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HEPS
HOPS COMES FROM THE FEMALE FLOWERS
OF A GRAPELIKE, PERENNIAL VINE.
HOPS (HUMULUS LUPULUS). HOPS HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT
ANXIETY, INSOMNIA AND RESTLESSNESS FOR MORE THAN 1,000
YEARS, EVER SINCE THE PLANT BECAME A POPULAR INGREDIENT IN BEER. HOPS' SEDATIVE INGREDIENT IS APPARENDY THE COMPOUND METHYL-BUTENOL, WHICH
HAS A SEDATING EFFECT ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS
SYSTEM. SMOKING HOPS IS SAID TO HAVE A
SEDATIVE EFFECT, AND WHILE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND SMOKING IT, IT DOES MAKE A PLEASANTLY
BITTER-TASTING TEA.
V ROOIBOS (ASPALATHUS LINEARIS).
ALTHOUGH NOT USUALLY GROWN IN THE UNITED
STATES, THIS SHRUBBY AFRICAN LEGUME IS
AVAILABLE IN SELECTED HERB STORES. TEA MADE
WITH THIS HERB IS A BEDTIME FAVORITE AMONG
SOUTH AFRICAN HERBALISTS, CONSUMERS AND
EVEN PHYSICIANS. SOUTH AFRICANS ALSO USE IT
TO IMPROVE APPETITE, CALM THE DIGESTIVE TRACT
AND REDUCE NERVOUS TENSION. THEY REGARD IT AS SAFE ENOUGH TO GIVE INFANTS.
V HERBAL FORMULAS. IN SEARCHING MY DATABASE FOR PLANTS THAT ARE RICH
IN SEDATIVE COMPOUNDS, I TURNED UP SEVERAL SURPRISES. MANY PLANTS THAT ARE RICH IN
SLEEP-INDUCING CHEMICALS HAVE LITTLE OR NO FOLKLORIC REPUTATION AS SLEEP AIDS.
AMONG THEM ARE GINGER, WITH 11 DIFFERENT SEDATIVE COMPOUNDS; BASIL, THYME, TANGERINES AND TOMATOES WITH 9; CINNAMON, SPEARMINT, RED PEPPER, PENNYROYAL AND
ORANGES, 8; AND PEPPERMINT, 7.1 CAN'T PROVE THAT A TOMATO SALAD WITH BASIL AND
THYME OR A CUP OF SPEARMINT TEA WITH GINGER AND CINNAMON WILL BRING ON THE
SANDMAN, BUT IF YOU HAVE SLEEP PROBLEMS, IT MIGHT HELP TO EAT THESE FOODS AND
HERBS MORE FREQUENUY.
IN ADDITION, CALIFORNIA HERBALIST CHRISTOPHER HOBBS, A FOURTH-GENERATION
BOTANIST AND AUTHOR OF ABOUT A DOZEN BOOKS I OFTEN REFER TO, SUGGESTS A NUMBER
OF COMBINATIONS THAT CAN TREAT SLEEPLESSNESS AND ITS CLOSE RELATIVES, ANXIETY AND
STRESS. FOR INSOMNIA HOBBS SUGGESTS TREATMENT WITH PASSIONFLOWER, VALERIAN
AND CALIFORNIA POPPY. TO BANISH THE ANXIETY THAT MAY CAUSE INSOMNIA, HE RECOMMENDS A COMBINATION OF CALIFORNIA POPPY, HAWTHORN AND HOPS. AND TO HELP
COPE WITH STRESSFUL SITUATIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO INSOMNIA, HOBBS RECOMMENDS TWO PARTS EACH OF CAMOMILE, LAVENDER, LEMON BALM AND LINDEN WITH
ONE PART ORANGE PEEL.

INTERMITTENT
CLAUDICATION
H
AVING PASSED BY THE MATURE AGE OF 67,1 KNOW I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
ABOUT THE MANY MANIFESTATIONS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. I LIKE TO
KEEP ACTIVE, SO THE LAST THING I WANT IS CHEST PAIN OR LEG PAIN SLOWING ME DOWN.
WHEN CHOLESTEROL-LADEN PLAQUES SUBSTANTIALLY NARROW THE CORONARY ARTERIES, THE RESULT IS ANGINA—CHEST PAIN BROUGHT ON BY EXERTION. WHEN THE SAME
PROCESS OCCURS IN THE ARTERIES OF THE LEGS, THE RESULT IS INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION, WHICH CAUSES LEG PAIN WHEN YOU EXERCISE. THE PAIN TENDS TO SHOW UP AFTER
YOU'VE WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE.
INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION IS THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM OF WHAT'S KNOWN
AS PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. THE PAIN RESULTS FROM POOR OXYGENATION OF THE
LEG MUSCLES BECAUSE OF REDUCED BLOOD FLOW IN THE NARROWED LEG ARTERIES.
AMONG CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, THE ONES WE HEAR MOST ABOUT ARE HEART ATTACK, STROKE, ANGINA AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION
DOESN'T GET MUCH PRESS, BUT IT'S A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND LOSS OF MOBILITY IN
THE ELDERLY. ABOUT 750,000 AMERICANS DEVELOP IT ANNUALLY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION
IF YOU HAVE INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION, YOU SHOULD BE UNDER THE CARE OF A
DOCTOR, WHO WILL USUALLY PRESCRIBE MEDICATIONS TO DEAL WITH THE CONDITION. I'M
CONVINCED THAT MANY PEOPLE COULD GET OFF THE PHARMACEUTICALS AND FEEL BETTER
IF THEY KNEW ABOUT HERBAL ALTERNATIVES. YOU SHOULD DISCUSS THIS POSSIBILITY WITH
YOUR DOCTOR, BUT DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATIONS ON YOUR OWN. HERE ARE THE
HERBS THAT CAN HELP.
W*. GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). IN ONE RIGOROUS 12-WEEK STUDY, A LARGE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION WERE GIVEN 800 MILLIGRAMS OF
GARLIC A DAY. ON AVERAGE, THEY WALKED NOTICEABLY BETTER BY THEIR FIFTH WEEK OF
TAKING THE HERB. THEY ALSO HAD LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL LEVELS.
GARLIC IS A TERRIFIC HERB FOR TREATING ANY CARDIOVASCULAR SYMPTOM. FOR INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION PREVENTION OR THERAPY, EAT AT LEAST ONE RAW CLOVE A DAY.
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF YUMMY WAYS TO ENJOY RAW GARLIC. I SUGGEST CHOPPING A
CLOVE AND TOSSING IT INTO A SALAD OR SPRINKLING IT OVER A PASTA DISH.
VVV GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS THE PREMIER PLANT MEDICINE FOR IN299
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TERMITTENT CLAUDICATION. IT IMPROVES BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE LEGS JUST AS IT DOES
THROUGH THE HEART AND BRAIN BY OPENING (DILATING) THE ARTERIES.
NINE EXCELLENT STUDIES THAT I'VE REVIEWED SHOW THAT 40 MILLIGRAMS OF GINKGO
EXTRACT TWICE A DAY PROVIDE BETTER RELIEF THAN PENTOXYFILLINE (TRENTAL), THE STANDARD
MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION. PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION FOUND THAT THEY COULD GO 75 TO 110 PERCENT FARTHER WITHOUT
PAIN IF THEY TOOK THE HERBAL EXTRACT. PEOPLE USING TRENTAL, ON THE OTHER HAND, INCREASED THEIR PAIN-FREE WALKING DISTANCE BY ONLY 65 PERCENT.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT GINKGO IS CHEAPER—ABOUT $20 A MONTH COMPARED TO
MORE THAN $50 FOR TRENTAL. AND GINKGO SIDE EFFECTS ARE MINIMAL, CONSISTING OF
OCCASIONAL ABDOMINAL DISTRESS, HEADACHE OR DIZZINESS.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE GINKGO, YOU NEED TO USE EXTRACTS RATHER THAN TAKING
THE LEAF ITSELF. THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN GINKGO ARE PRESENT IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN THE LEAF, TOO LOW TO BE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. WHEN YOU GET A
STANDARD GINKGO EXTRACT, IT'S A 50:1 PREPARATION, MEANING THAT 50 POUNDS OF
LEAVES ARE PROCESSED TO GET 1 POUND OF EXTRACT. YOU CAN PURCHASE STANDARDIZED
EXTRACTS AT MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES AND PHARMACIES.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). IN VARIOUS STUDIES, GINGER HAS BEEN
SHOWN TO BE ALMOST AS EFFECTIVE, OR AS EFFECTIVE, AS ASPIRIN AND GARLIC IN PREVENTING
THE BLOOD CLOTS THAT TRIGGER HEART ATTACK. SIMILAR CLOTTING IN THE LEG CAN TRIGGER INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION PAIN. IF I HAD THIS CONDITION, I'D EAT A LOT OF GINGER.
VV HAWTHORN (CRATAEGUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). IN STUDIES, PEOPLE WITH INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION SHOWED BETTER BLOOD FLOW AND WALKING PERFORMANCE AFTER
BEING INJECTED WITH HAWTHORN EXTRACT. PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO INJECT IT
TO GET THE BENEFIT.
NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND TAKING 120 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS OF A STANDARDIZED
EXTRACT CONTAINING 1.8 PERCENT VITEXIN-4-RHAMNOSIDE OR 10 PERCENT OLIGOMERIC
PROCYANIDINS THREE TIMES A DAY.
HAWTHORN IS A POWERFUL HEART MEDICINE. IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS HERB,
PLEASE DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
VV PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). SATURATED FAT IS A MAJOR CULPRIT IN
CAUSING ANY FORM OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, INCLUDING INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION. THE BENEFICIAL OILS KNOWN AS OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS HELP PREVENT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND PURSLANE IS OUR BEST LEAFY SOURCE OF OMEGA-3'S. IT'S ALSO
EXTREMELY WELL ENDOWED WITH ANTIOXIDANTS, SUBSTANCES THAT MOP UP FREE RADICALS, HIGHLY REACTIVE OXYGEN MOLECULES THAT DAMAGE THE BODY'S CELLS AND CONTRIBUTE TO HEART DISEASE.
PURSLANE IS A DELICIOUS VEGETABLE. I STEAM THE LEAVES AND EAT THEM LIKE
SPINACH OR ADD THEM RAW TO SALADS AND SOUPS.

INTESTINAL PARASITES
F
RIENDS, RELATIVES AND STRANGERS OFTEN APPROACH ME FOR ADVICE ABOUT
HEALING WITH HERBS. ONE OF MY MOST INTERESTING INQUIRIES A FEW YEARS
AGO CAME FROM A HOLISTICALLY INCLINED FRIEND WHO HAD AMEBIASIS, OFTEN KNOWN
AS AMEBIC DYSENTERY.
SHE'D INITIALLY BEEN MISDIAGNOSED, AND BY THE TIME HER DOCTOR FIGURED OUT
WHAT SHE REALLY HAD, SHE WAS IN A BAD WAY, WITH DIARRHEA, FLATULENCE AND SEVERE
ABDOMINAL DISTRESS. HER DOCTOR PRESCRIBED THE STANDARD DRUG, METRONIDAZOLE
(FLAGYL), BUT LIKE MANY PEOPLE, SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS. HER QUESTION TO ME WAS, WHAT DID I THINK ABOUT HER TRYING THE CHINESE
HERB QING HAO?
I REPLIED THAT QING HAO, WHICH WE AMERICANS CALL SWEET ANNIE, WAS BEING
PRESCRIBED FOR AMEBIASIS BY THREE PHYSICIANS I KNEW IN NEW YORK CITY, WITH
GOOD RESULTS. I KNEW THIS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR PATIENTS HAD COME TO ME
SEEKING A FREE SOURCE OF THIS HERB. ONE YOUNG LADY WHO HAD A BAD CASE OF INTESTINAL PARASITES (GIARDIA) HAD APPARENDY ACHIEVED RELIEF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
OVER TWO YEARS BY USING QING HAO IN COMBINATION WITH ANOTHER CHINESE HERBAL
INGREDIENT, GOSSYPOL.
AMOEBAS AMONG US
WORLDWIDE, AN ESTIMATED 500 MILLION PEOPLE ARE INFECTED WITH INTESTINAL
PARASITES, AND THESE MICROORGANISMS CONTRIBUTE TO THOUSANDS OF DEATHS EACH
YEAR. AMEBIASIS AND GIARDIASIS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CAUSED BY TINY PARASITES
KNOWN AS AMOEBAS, ARE INCREASINGLY COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES.
MANY TRAVELERS BRING THEM HOME FROM ABROAD, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
OUR SHORES TO COME DOWN WITH A CASE. GIARDIA HAS BECOME ENDEMIC IN NORTH
AMERICAN WILDLIFE. TWENTY YEARS AGO, IT WAS SAFE TO DRINK FROM WILDERNESS
STREAMS IN THE WEST WITHOUT BOILING THE WATER, BUT NO LONGER. GIARDIA-CONTAMINATED WILDLIFE WASTES HAVE INTRODUCED THE PARASITE INTO JUST ABOUT EVERY ONCEPRISTINE WATERWAY.
METRONIDAZOLE IS THE MEDICAL DRUG OF CHOICE FOR GETTING RID OF INTESTINAL
PARASITES. WHILE IT IS EFFECTIVE AND GENERALLY SAFE, THE WOMAN WHO DIDN'T WANT
TO TAKE IT WAS RIGHT TO BE CAUTIOUS. IT CAN CAUSE SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING
ABDOMINAL DISTRESS, NAUSEA AND VOMITING (ESPECIALLY IF YOU DRINK ALCOHOL WHILE
TAKING IT). MORE SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE, NOTABLY SEIZURES AND
NERVE DAMAGE TO THE EXTREMITIES, A CONDITION KNOWN AS PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY.
301
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
GREEN PHARMACY FOR INTESTINAL PARASITES
I WOULDN'T CRITICIZE ANYONE FOR TAKING METRONIDAZOLE. AFTER ALL, IF YOU HAVE
INTESTINAL PARASITES, YOU WANT THEM GONE. BUT IF YOU'D RATHER NOT TAKE THIS DRUG,
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBAL ALTERNATIVES.
SOME OF THE HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS CHAPTER CAN PRODUCE SIDE EFFECTS SUCH
AS NAUSEA WHEN TAKEN IN DOSES HIGH ENOUGH TO DISLODGE AND KILL PARASITES. ON
THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF THESE PARASITES CAN BE LIFE-THREATENING IF YOU DON'T TAKE
AGGRESSIVE ACTION. SO, WHATEVER YOU DO, BE SURE TO WORK WITH YOUR DOCTOR, EVEN
IF YOU'RE TAKING THE HERBAL APPROACH. HERE ARE THE HERBS THAT MIGHT HELP.
^ W CINCHONA (CINCHONA, VARIOUS SPECIES). CINCHONA BARK IS THE HERBAL
SOURCE OF THE ANTIMALARIAL DRUG QUININE. AMOEBAS ARE CLOSE KIN TO THE MICROBES
THAT CAUSE MALARIA, AND THE SAME KINDS OF COMPOUNDS SEEM TO WORK ON BOTH.
THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN CINCHONA BESIDES QUININE
AND QUINIDINE. MANY OF THESE WILL ALSO WORK AGAINST AMOEBAS. CINCHONA BARK IS
AVAILABLE FROM SOME HERBALISTS AND CAN BE MADE INTO A TEA, WHICH, I SHOULD
WARN YOU, TASTES QUITE BITTER. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT, STEEP ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON OF POWDERED BARK IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR TEN MINUTES. I'D SUGGEST
DRINKING TWO OR THREE CUPS A DAY.
W V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). THE COMPOUND BERBERINE, A
PROVEN AMEBICIDE, OCCURS IN FIVE HERBS THAT HAVE YELLOW ROOTS, MOST NOTABLY GOLDENSEAL BUT ALSO GOLDTHREAD, BARBERRY, OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT. BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL WITH IT. THE LD50 (THE TECHNICAL TERM FOR THE DOSE THAT KILLS HALF OF
THOSE WHO TAKE IT) IS ONLY ABOUT TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN THE THERAPEUTIC DOSE FOR GETTING RID OF INTESTINAL PARASITES. THE LESSON? DON'T GO OVERBOARD WITH GOLDENSEAL.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY THIS HERB, PLEASE DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. THE RECOMMENDED DOSE FOR KILLING PARASITES IS
 XA TO
 XH OUNCE OF DRIED HERB DIVIDED INTO
THREE PARTS AND TAKEN OVER THE PERIOD OF ONE DAY, IN TEA OR CAPSULES.
ANOTHER WORD OF WARNING: BECAUSE THIS MUCH GOLDENSEAL MIGHT CAUSE MISCARRIAGE, DON'T USE THIS TREATMENT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT.
HAVING SAID ALL THIS, I SHOULD ADD THAT I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS EVER
SUFFERED SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS FROM THIS HERB, AND THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT MANY
HAVE BENEFITED.
ONE STUDY COMPARED PURE BERBERINE COMPOUND WITH METRONIDAZOLE. OF 40
CHILDREN WITH GIARDIA, 48 PERCENT OF THOSE TREATED WITH BERBERINE STOPPED EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS, WHILE ONLY 33 PERCENT OF THOSE TREATED WITH METRONIDAZOLE FELT SIMILAR RELIEF.
SOME PHARMACOGNOSISTS (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACISTS) COME OUT IN FAVOR
OF TAKING BERBERINE SULFATE BUT ADVISE AGAINST TAKING GOLDENSEAL AND OTHER
302
INTESTINAL PARASITES
HERBS CONTAINING THIS COMPOUND. IF I HAD INTESTINAL PARASITES, FD STILL TRY THE
HERBAL APPROACH. I THINK IT WORKS.
W V IPECAC (CEPHAETIS IPECACUANHA). HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES, WE THINK OF IPECAC AS AN EMERGENCY
TREATMENT TO INDUCE VOMITING WHEN A CHILD
INGESTS A POISON. BUT THIS HERBAL ROOT HAS
ANOTHER MAJOR ROLE IN THE TROPICS, WHERE IT
COMES FROM: IT KILLS AMOEBAS. IT CONTAINS AT
LEAST THREE AMEBICIDAL COMPOUNDS, CEPHAELINE, DEHYDROEMETINE AND EMETINE.
GERMANY'S COMMISSION E, THE EXPERT
PANEL THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES FOR THE GERMAN
GOVERNMENT, RECOMMENDS TAKING 30 DROPS
OF AN IPECAC TINCTURE (PART IPECAC AND PART
ALCOHOL). THIS IS A ONE-TIME ONLY TREATMENT.
VV ELECAMPANE (INULA HELENIUM).
THIS COMMON NORTH AMERICAN HERB CONTAINS TWO ANTI-AMEBIC COMPOUNDS, ALANTOLACTONE AND ISOALANTOLACTONE. IF I HAD
INTESTINAL AMOEBAS, FD CERTAINLY GIVE ELECAMPANE A TRY, SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE SAFE.
TYPICALLY, HERBALISTS RECOMMEND BRINGING A
CUP OF WATER TO A BOIL, THEN DROPPING IN ONE
TEASPOON OF HERB AND SIMMERING FOR 20 MINUTES. YOU CAN DRINK UP TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
VV PAPAYA (CARICA PAPAYA). THIS
FRUIT CONTAINS BOTH ANTISEPTIC AND ANTIPARASITIC COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING ONE CALLED CARPAINE. I HAVE CHEWED THE PIQUANT SEEDS
ON OCCASION, AND IF I HAD AMEBIASIS, I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ADD A FEW CRUSHED
SEEDS TO ANY FRUIT JUICE. THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS GIVE A PUNGENT BITE TO THE SEEDS.
W SWEET ANNIE {ARTEMISIA ANNUA). AS FAR AS I KNOW, NEITHER SWEET
ANNIE NOR ITS ACTIVE INGREDIENT ARTEMISININ HAS BEEN APPROVED AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING INTESTINAL PARASITES. NONETHELESS, BOTH THE HERB AND THE PURE ACTIVE INGREDIENT ARE BEING USED SUCCESSFULLY FOR JUST THIS PURPOSE.
SWEET ANNIE HAS BEEN PROVEN BY RESEARCH IN CHINA AND AT THE WALTER REED
ARMY RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., FOR FIGHTING THE MALARIAL ORGANISM THAT IS KIN TO THE AMOEBA, SO THERE IS SOME RATIONALE FOR USING THIS HERB
TO TREAT AMEBIASIS.
ELECAMPANE
ELECAMPANE, ALSO KNOWN AS WILD
SUNFLOWER, WAS USED AS A VETERINARY
AS WELL AS A HUMAN MEDICINE IN THE
MIDDLE AGES.
303
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
IT'S HARD TO GET A HANDLE ON THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DOSE OF THIS HERB, AS THE
DOCTORS, VENDORS AND CONSUMERS I'VE SPOKEN TO ALL SUGGEST DIFFERENT AMOUNTS.
FOR THAT REASON, THIS WOULD NOT BE AMONG MY TOP CHOICES OF HERBS FOR TREATING
AMOEBAS. BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION, THOUGH, I WOULD CERTAINLY TRY THIS HERB JUDICIOUSLY IF I HAD ANY OF THE AMEBIC AILMENTS AND DID NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE
DOCTOR AND/OR DRUG AT HAND. I SUGGEST MAKING A TEA USING TWO TO FIVE TEASPOONS
OF THE HERB AND DRINKING ONE TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
V CUBEB (PIPER CUBEBA). CUBEB IS A SPICE THAT IS RELATED TO BUT NOT AS
WELL-KNOWN AS BLACK PEPPER. MY GOOD FRIENDS, PHARMACOGNOSIST ALBERT LEUNG,
PH.D., AND ARKANSAS HERBALIST STEVEN FOSTER, HAVE TEAMED UP ON AN UPDATE OF DR.
LEUNG'S THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS. IN THIS UPDATE THEY
CITE STUDIES SHOWING THAT GROUND CUBEB IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING AMEBIC DYSENTERY. CUBEB HAS LONG BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE TRADITIONAL AYURVEDIC MEDICINE OF
INDIA, AND IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF ITS POPULARITY IN THE UNITED STATES IS DUE TO RISE. YOU
CAN USE THE POWDER LIKE PEPPER IN COOKING.
LARYNGITIS
I
T WAS MY 32ND WEDDING ANNIVERSARY, AND MY BLUEGRASS BAND, DURHAM
STATION, WAS GETTING TOGETHER FOR A COOKOUT DINNER AND EVENING PICKING
PARTY. I HAD PROMISED TO TAPE A COUPLE OF HERBAL SONGS FOR RADIO PEOPLE WHO
NEEDED SOMETHING UNIQUE TO USE AS BACKGROUND MUSIC. (THE SONGS I'VE WRITTEN
ABOUT HERBS MOST DEFINITELY QUALIFY AS UNIQUE.)
AT NOON I CALLED OUR BANJO PICKER, WHO IS ALSO OUR HIGH TENOR SINGER, TO REMIND HIM TO BRING HIS RECORDING EQUIPMENT. "DON'T EXPECT ME TO SING," HE WHISPERED. HE'D SUNG HIS HEART OUT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND AWAKENED THAT MORNING WITH
CHEST CONGESTION AND LARYNGITIS.
TALK ABOUT DIRE EMERGENCIES! I FIXED HIM MY BEST HERBAL REMEDY, SOMETHING
I CALL CINEOLADE, A PINEAPPLE-GINGER JUICE IN WHICH I STEEP HERBS HIGH IN THE
CHEMICAL CINEOLE, WHICH IS REPORTEDLY USEFUL IN RELIEVING LARYNGITIS. AS I RECALL,
I USED ROSEMARY, SPEARMINT, CARDAMOM AND LAVENDER AND SWEETENED THE DRINK
WITH LICORICE.
WELL, THE BANJO PICKER DRANK THE BREW, AND HE SANG REASONABLY WELL. NO ONE
WHO HEARD HIM TALK BEFORE HE DRANK THE TEA COULD QUITE BELIEVE HOW GOOD HE
SOUNDED WHEN HE GOT AROUND TO SINGING. OUR RECORDINGS TURNED OUT OKAY, TOO.
304
LARYNGITI S
GREEN PHARMACY FOR LARYNGITIS
LARYNGITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE VOCAL CORDS THAT CAUSES HOARSENESS OR
VOICE LOSS AND USUALLY A DRY, SORE THROAT. MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS AT PHARMACIES AND HEALTH FOOD STORES, YOU CAN FIND HERBAL LOZENGES FOR SORE THROAT AND
LARYNGITIS. THEY TASTE PRETTY GOOD. IF YOU HAVE CHRONIC LARYNGITIS, THOUGH, SEE
YOUR DOCTOR: IT MAY BE A SYMPTOM OF A SERIOUS CONDITION. BUT FOR AN OCCASIONAL
BOUT OF LARYNGITIS, YOU CAN TURN TO THE GREEN PHARMACY FOR HELP. HERE ARE SEVERAL GOOD HERBS TO TRY.
VVV CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING CINEOLE. THE CINEOLE CONTAINED IN THE CINEOLADE I GAVE TO MY BANJOPICKING BUDDY IS AN EXPECTORANT THAT CAN HELP BRING RELIEF.
HERE ARE SEVERAL HERBS WITH HIGH CINEOLE CONTENT, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF
POTENCY: CARDAMOM, EUCALYPTUS, SPEARMINT, ROSEMARY, SWEET ANNIE, GINGER,
NUTMEG, LAVENDER, BEE BALM, PEPPERMINT AND TANSY. I SUGGEST MAKING A TEA
USING A SELECTION OF THESE HERBS, AND GO HEAVY ON THE GINGER. ADD SOME
PINEAPPLE JUICE BEFORE DRINKING.
'W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE)* AFTER READING NEW ENGLAND HERBALIST
PAUL SCHULICK'S NICE BOOK, GINGER: COMMON SPICE AND
WONDER DRUG, I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT IN RECOMMENDING
THIS HERB. I'M MORE A TEA MAN THAN A CANDY MAN, BUT IF I
HAD LARYNGITIS, I MIGHT TRY CANDIED GINGER.
VV HOREHOUND (MARRUBIUM VULGARE). THIS HERB HAS BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES
TO TREAT COUGHS AND OTHER RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS LIKE LARYNGITIS. COMMISSION E, THE BODY
OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, ENDORSES HOREHOUND FOR
BRONCHIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING LARYNGITIS. THE
SUGGESTED DOSAGE IS A TEA MADE WITH ONE TO
TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER.
BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THE FOOD
AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION DECLARED HOREHOUND INEFFECTIVE IN TREATING SORE THROAT
AND LARYNGITIS? THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH
HOREHOUND BUT RATHER WITH THE AGENCY
CHARGED WITH PROTECTING AND PROMOTING THE
PUBLIC HEALTH. HOREHOUND IS ONE OF THE FIRST
HERBS I SUGGEST FOR THROAT PROBLEMS. I'D
HOREHOUND
HOREHOUND TEA, MADE FROM DRIED
LEAVES AND FLOWER TOPS, IS A POPULAR
FOLK REMEDY FOR COUGHS AND COLDS.
305
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
RECOMMEND A STRONG HOREHOUND TEA WITH LEMON, LICORICE AND STEVIA, WHICH IS
AVAILABLE IN MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES. YOU CAN OPEN A TEA BAG AND ADD A PINCH
OF HERB IN PLACE OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER.
W MALLOWS (ALTHAEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE MALLOWS, INCLUDING MARSH
MALLOW, THE HERBAL FORERUNNER OF OUR PILLOWY CANDY TREAT, HAVE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AS THROAT SOOTHERS. THEY ARE USEFUL IN TREATING LARYNGITIS, COLDS,
COUGHS, SORE THROAT AND BRONCHITIS.
MALLOWS CONTAIN A SPECIAL GELATINOUS FIBER, MUCILAGE, THAT SOOTHES MUCOUS
MEMBRANES AND HELPS PROTECT THEM FROM BACTERIA AND INFLAMMATION. COMMISSION E APPROVES MALLOWS FOR THROAT PAIN, INFLAMMATION AND IRRITATION. SOUNDS
LIKE A LARYNGITIS TREATMENT TO ME.
^ V MULLEIN (VERBASCUM THAPSUS). LIKE MALLOW, MULLEIN FLOWERS HAVE
CONSITUTENTS THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE LARYNGITIS SYMPTOMS. MAKE A TEA WITH ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES.
V COUCHGRASS (AGROPYRON REPENS OR ELYMUS REP ENS). BECAUSE OF ITS
OTHER NAME, QUACKGRASS, THIS IS MY FAVORITE-NAMED HERBAL MEDICINE. IT IS APPROVED
BY COMMISSION E FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS SUCH AS LARYNGITIS AND COUGH.
V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN
AS CONEFLOWER, IS USEFUL FOR RELIEVING OR TREATING LARYNGITIS, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E. ECHINACEA ALSO ENHANCES IMMUNE FUNCTION, WHICH SHOULD HELP THE BODY
FIGHT ANY VIRUS THAT'S CAUSING THE LARYNGITIS. (WHILE IT MAY MAKE YOUR TONGUE TINGLE
OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
V ELECAMPANE {INULA HELENIUM). ELECAMPANE IS AN ANTISEPTIC EXPECTORANT THAT IS USEFUL IN TREATING LARYNGITIS. THIS HERB'S BENEFITS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED
CLINICALLY AND EXPERIMENTALLY TO MY SATISFACTION.
NOTED BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK,
WHOM I RESPECT, SUGGESTS A THREE-HERB COMBO TEA MADE WITH EQUAL PARTS OF ELECAMPANE, HOREHOUND AND MULLEIN. YOU MIGHT TRY ONE TEASPOON OF EACH PER CUP
OF BOILING WATER AND STEEP FOR TEN MINUTES. OTHER ELECAMPANE FANS SUGGEST
POURING ONE CUP OF COLD WATER OVER ONE TEASPOON OF SHREDDED ELECAMPANE AND
STEEPING IT FOR TEN HOURS. YOU CAN DRINK THE TEA THREE TIMES DAILY.
V IVY (HEDERA HELIX). IVY IS AN OLD FOLK REMEDY FOR WHOOPING COUGH.
COMMISSION E SUGGESTS TAKING A PINCH OF DRIED IVY (0.3 GRAM) TO RELIEVE INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT, INCLUDING LARYNGITIS. IVY HAS EXPECTORANT ACTION, AND IT HELPS MINIMIZE BRONCHIAL SECRETIONS THAT CAN CAUSE COUGH AND
THROAT IRRITATION.
V KNOTGRASS (POLYGONUM AVICULARE). COMMISSION E APPROVES MAKING
A TEA WITH TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED KNOTGRASS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER TO
TREAT SORE THROAT AND LARYNGITIS.
306
LICE
V PLANTAIN {PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). HERBALISTS HAVE USED PLANTAIN
FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT SORE THROAT, LARYNGITIS, COUGH AND BRONCHITIS. COMMISSION E
CONCURS, NOTING THAT ENGLISH PLANTAIN (P. LANCEOLATE) IN PARTICULAR IS A SAFE, EFFECTIVE ANTIBACTERIAL, ASTRINGENT THROAT SOOTHER. THE SUGGESTED DOSAGE IS ONE TEASPOON
PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP UNTIL COOL.
V PRIMROSE (PRIMULA VERIS). COMMISSION E SUGGESTS USING ONE TO TWO
TEASPOONS OF DRIED PRIMROSE FLOWERS OR ONE TEASPOON OF THE PLANT'S DRIED ROOT AS A
RESPIRATORY REMEDY FOR LARYNGITIS, BRONCHITIS, COLDS AND COUGHS. (NOTE THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION IS FOR PRIMROSE, NOT EVENING PRIMROSE.)
V SOAPWORT (SAPONARIA OFFICINALIS). CHEMICALS (SAPONINS) IN SOAPWORT
REPORTEDLY HAVE PAIN-RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY THAT MAY HELP LARYNGITIS. COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS MAKING A TEA WITH ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB
PER CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR TREATING RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING LARYNGITIS.
V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). IN RECENT YEARS, STINGING NETTLE LEAVES
AND ROOT JUICE HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION BECAUSE OF STUDIES SUGGESTING
THEIR USEFULNESS IN TREATING ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS AND HAY FEVER. I'D ALSO TRY STINGING
NETDE TEA FOR LARYNGITIS.
V SUNDEW (DROSERA, VARIOUS SPECIES). IF YOUR LARYNGITIS IS DUE TO A
HACKING COUGH, SUNDEW IS WORTH TRYING. IT CONTAINS A COUGH SUPPRESSANT COMPOUND (CARBOXY-OXY-NAPTHOQUINONE), WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO CODEINE, AND OTHER
CONSTITUENTS THAT CALM THE MUSCLE SPASMS THAT CAN TRIGGER COUGHING. GERMAN
STUDIES OF SUNDEW AS A TREATMENT FOR LARYNGITIS, SORE THROAT AND BRONCHITIS SHOW
GOOD RESULTS IN MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF USERS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS.
ONE OF THE COMPOUNDS IN SUNDEW, PLUMBAGIN, INHIBITS SEVERAL TYPES OF
BACTERIA THAT CAUSE LARYNGITIS.
V HOT, SPICY FOODS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ETHNOBOTANICAL LITERATURE FROM
AROUND THE WORLD, YOU'LL FIND THAT SPICY FOODS HAVE BEEN USED TRADITIONALLY TO TREAT
LARYNGITIS AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS. IT MAKES SENSE TO ME. GARLIC, GINGER,
HORSERADISH AND MUSTARD ALL SEEM USEFUL FOR RELIEVING LARYNGITIS, ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THICK SECRETIONS IN THE AIRWAYS.

REAL LICE CRAWLING OVER ME. PERHAPS IT WAS JUST MY IMAGINATION. BUT EVEN IF I
JUST IMAGINED THOSE LICE, THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO
DO SO. THE HOTEL WAS FILTHY AND VERY BUG-RIDDEN.
SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY OFFHAND KNOWLEDGE OF HERBAL LICE REMEDIES, I
THREADED MY WAY THROUGH THE TROPICAL FOLIAGE TO A GOOD DOCTOR. MY FRIEND
LINNEA SMITH, M.D., SEARCHED BUT SAW NO LICE. JUST IN CASE, HOWEVER, SHE GAVE
ME A BOTTLE OF KWELL SHAMPOO, THE CLASSIC LICE MEDICINE. I DUTIFULLY SHAMPOOED. WELL, I MUST HAVE HAD LICE OR A SIMILAR INFESTATION, BECAUSE AFTER THAT
KWELL TREATMENT, MY ITCH-MISERY CEASED.
LICE ARE A FAMILIAR—AND "LOUSY"—PROBLEM FOR SOME TEN MILLION AMERICANS EACH YEAR. THAT ADDS UP TO A LOT OF KWELL AND OTHER DELOUSING PRODUCTS.
BUT WHAT ELSE IS THERE? HERE GOES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR LICE
FEW HERBAL REFERENCE BOOKS RECOMMEND BOTANICAL REMEDIES FOR LICE, SO I
HOPE HERBALISTS NOTICE THIS CHAPTER AND BEGIN INCLUDING LICE-KILLING HERBS
(PEDICULICIDES) IN THEIR WORKS. HERE ARE A FEW HERBS THAT CAN SEND LICE PACKING.
V NEEM (AZADIRACTA INDICA) AND TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). IN
ONE STUDY DONE IN INDIA, RESEARCHERS TREATED 814 PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF LICE WITH
A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO HERBAL REMEDIES.
NEEM IS A LARGE OAKLIKE TREE THAT'S NATIVE TO INDIA AND IS NOW PLANTED
AROUND THE SUBTROPICAL WORLD, INCLUDING FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE
LEAVES AND SEED OIL CONTAIN COMPOUNDS THAT APPEAR TO BE ACTIVE AGAINST MANY
INSECT PESTS. FOR THIS REASON, U.S. COMPANIES THAT MARKET NONTOXIC PESTICIDES
NOW OFFER SEVERAL NEEM PRODUCTS TO ORGANIC FARMERS. (SOME FRIENDS OF MINE IN
HAWAII ARE NOW GROWING AND HARVESTING NEEM.)
TURMERIC HAS A LONG HISTORY IN ASIAN FOLKLORE AS A VERMIN KILLER, AND IT'S
ESPECIALLY GOOD AT FIGHTING SCABIES, WHICH ARE PARASITIC MITES. IT MAKES SENSE
THAT RESEARCHERS WOULD TRY TURMERIC FOR LICE. IN ONE STUDY, THEY PREPARED A
NEEM-TURMERIC PASTE BY PULVERIZING FRESH NEEM LEAVES AND TURMERIC ROOT (FOUR
PARTS NEEM TO ONE PART TURMERIC). THE PEOPLE IN THIS STUDY RUBBED THE PASTE ALL
OVER THEIR BODIES AND ALLOWED IT TO DRY. THEY REPEATED THE TREATMENT UNTIL THEY
NO LONGER FELT OR SAW LICE. MEANWHILE, THEY ALSO BOILED THEIR CLOTHES AND BEDDING, A STANDARD RECOMMENDATION FOR DELOUSING.
RESEARCHERS REPORTED THAT 98 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STUDY WERE COMPLETELY CURED WITHIN 3 TO 15 DAYS. THEY ALSO NOTED THAT THE 2 PERCENT WHO REMAINED INFESTED HAD NOT FOLLOWED THE PROGRAM.
V SWEETFLAG (ACORUS CALAMUS). THE AMERICAN SPECIES OF THIS PLANT,
WHICH GROWS IN TEMPERATE REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD, HAS PROVEN LICE-KILLING PROP308

OR RUBBED DIRECTLY ONTO THE AFFLICTED AREAS.
LIVER PROBLEMS
I
HAD HEPATITIS IN PANAMA 25 YEARS AGO, AND I DID WHAT MY DOCTORS TOLD
ME: I STOPPED DRINKING ALCOHOL UNTIL I RECOVERED, WHICH WAS A CHALLENGE
BECAUSE IN PANAMA, THE RUM IS CHEAP AND TASTY. AND I RESTED. THAT WAS IT.
MAINSTREAM MEDICINE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO OFFER PEOPLE WITH HEPATITIS
THEN—AND IT STILL DOESN'T.
BUT HERBAL MEDICINE DOES. WHEN MY SON DEVELOPED HEPATITIS A FEW YEARS
AGO, HIS DOCTOR GAVE HIM THE SAME ADVICE MINE GAVE ME IN PANAMA YEARS AGO.
BUT THIS TIME AROUND, I KNEW MORE ABOUT MEDICINAL HERBS, SO I GAVE MY SON TWO
BOTTLES OF MILK THISTLE CAPSULES.
MILK THISTLE IS MY TOP-CHOICE HERB FOR ALL KINDS OF LIVER AILMENTS, INCLUDING
EVERYTHING FROM HEPATITIS TO CIRRHOSIS TO AMANITA MUSHROOM POISONING.
LIVER TROUBLES
THE LEADING CAUSE OF LIVER DISEASE IS ALCOHOL, WHICH CAUSES CIRRHOSIS. ALCOHOLISM AFFECTS AN ESTIMATED TEN MILLION AMERICANS, CAUSING SOME 200,000
DEATHS A YEAR AND MAKING IT ONE OF OUR MOST SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. ALCOHOLIC
LIVER DISEASE IS THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN 25- TO 64-YEAR-OLD MEN.
AFTER ALCOHOL, HEPATITIS IS THE NUMBER TWO CAUSE OF LIVER DISEASE. HEPATITIS,
WHICH SIMPLY MEANS INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER, IS NOT ONE DISEASE BUT MANY.
THERE IS ACUTE HEPATITIS (WHICH EVENTUALLY HEALS) OR THE CHRONIC VARIETY (WHICH
CAN CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME). HEPATITIS CAN BE CAUSED BY VIRUSES; THE TYPES
ARE INDICATED WITH LETTERS—A, B, C, D OR E—AND OTHER LETTERS ARE SURE TO BE
ADDED AS NEW VIRUSES ARE IDENTIFIED. IT CAN ALSO BE CAUSED BY ALCOHOL, MEDICATIONS (EVEN ACETAMINOPHEN PRODUCTS LIKE TYLENOL) OR OVEREXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL
CHEMICALS, SUCH AS FUMES FROM DRY-CLEANING CHEMICALS LIKE CARBON TETRACHLORIDE.
THERE ARE MORE THAN 300,000 CASES OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF HEPATITIS EACH
YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. HEPATITIS B IS PARTICULARLY INSIDIOUS. IT IS SPREAD LIKE
AIDS, SEXUALLY AND BY BLOOD-TO-BLOOD CONTACT.
309
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
ABOUT 5,000 PEOPLE A YEAR DIE FROM HEPATITIS B, AND IF YOU SURVIVE IT,
YOU'RE AT RISK FOR LIVER CANCER YEARS LATER. FORTUNATELY, THERE'S NOW A HEPATITIS
B VACCINE. BUT THERE ARE NO VACCINES FOR THE OTHER FORMS OF HEPATITIS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR LIVER PROBLEMS
SINCE MAINSTREAM MEDICINE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH TO OFFER IN THE WAY OF HEPATITIS TREATMENT BEYOND REST, I THINK IT'S TOO BAD THAT OUR HIGH PRIESTS OF MEDICINE DON'T READ THE HERBAL LITERATURE MORE OFTEN. THEY MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT MILK THISTLE AND THE MANY OTHER HERBS THAT CAN HELP TREAT LIVER DISEASE.
V W CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). SCIENTISTS IN INDIA HAVE DISCOVERED THAT CARROTS AFFORD SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION FOR THE LIVER, AT LEAST EXPERIMENTALLY IN LABORATORY
ANIMALS. WHEN LIVER CELL INJURY WAS INDUCED EXPERIMENTALLY WITH CHEMICALS, PARALLELING THE LIVER DAMAGE INFLICTED BY CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS, EXPERIMENTS SHOWED
THAT LAB ANIMALS COULD RECOVER WITH THE HELP OF CARROT EXTRACTS. THESE EXTRACTS INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF SEVERAL ENZYMES THAT SPEED UP DETOXIFICATION OF THE LIVER AND
OTHER ORGANS.
V%V DANDELION ({TARAXACUM OFFICINALE), "DANDELION ROOT HEADS THE LIST
. , OF EXCELLENT FOODS FOR THE LIVER," WRITES HERBAL
PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D.,
AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAMEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, THE
LEAVES ARE A DIURETIC, MEANING THAT THEY HELP
FLUSH EXCESS WATER FROM THE BODY. AND THE ROOTS
HAVE BEEN USED FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT JAUNDICE,
THE YELLOWING OF THE SKIN THAT OCCURS AS A RESULT
OF A SERIOUSLY MALFUNCTIONING LIVER.
I RECOMMEND USING BOTH THE LEAVES AND
FLOWERS. DANDELION FLOWERS ARE WELL-ENDOWED
WITH LECITHIN, A NUTRIENT THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN
USEFUL IN VARIOUS LIVER AILMENTS.
SINCE DANDELION IS A FOOD PLANT, I SUGGEST
STEAMING THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS LIKE SPINACH AND
EATING A LOT OF THIS DELICIOUS VEGETABLE. IF YOU
DON'T CARE FOR THE BITTER TASTE, HERB SHOPS AND
HEALTH FOOD STORES SELL CAPSULES AND TINCTURES.
FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V%>. INDIAN ALMOND (TERMINALIA CATAPPA). EXTRACTS OF THIS HERB HAVE BEEN SHOWN
IN STUDIES TO PREVENT CHEMICALLY INDUCED LIVER
DANDELION
THIS COMMON WEED WAS
PRESCRIBED BY CHINESE PHYSICIANS
FOR A WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS.

LIVER PROBLEM S
DAMAGE IN LABORATORY ANIMALS. UNFORTUNATELY, INDIAN ALMONDS ARE UNLIKE ANY OF
THE ALMONDS FOR SALE HERE IN AMERICA, BUT I HOPE THEY'LL BE MORE AVAILABLE HERE
SOMEDAY. THEY CAN BE FOUND GROWING WILD ON ALL TROPICAL COASTS, INCLUDING FLORIDA
AND HAWAII.
V W MILK THISTLE (SILYBUM MARIANUM). MILK THISTLE HAS BEEN USED AS A
LIVER REMEDY FOR AT LEAST 2,000 YEARS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COMPOUNDS FROM THE
SEEDS HELP PROTECT THE LIVER AGAINST DAMAGE FROM ALCOHOL AND HEPATITIS AND CAN
EVEN REGENERATE LIVER CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. THAT'S WHY COMMISSION E,
THE GERMAN EXPERT PANEL THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICINAL
HERBS FOR THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, APPROVES MILK THISTLE SEEDS OR SEED EXTRACTS AS
SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT FOR CIRRHOSIS AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY LIVER CONDITIONS.
OTHER STUDIES SHOW THAT THE COMPOUND SILYMARIN, WHICH IS FOUND IN MILK
THISTLE, HELPS PROTECT THE LIVER FROM MANY INDUSTRIAL TOXINS, SUCH AS CARBON
TETRACHLORIDE.
EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE LIVER DAMAGE OR LIVER DISEASE, MILK THISTLE HELPS IMPROVE LIVER FUNCTION BY
HELPING THE LIVER REMOVE TOXINS FROM YOUR BODY.
YOU CAN BUY MILK THISTLE CAPSULES AT HEALTH FOOD
STORES OR HERB SHOPS. FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
IF YOU'RE THE GARDENING TYPE, YOU CAN GROW YOUR
OWN. VERY YOUNG LEAVES OF THIS HERB CAN BE USED IN
SALADS, ALTHOUGH THEY CONTAIN ONLY TRACES OF SILYMARIN. IN ADDITION TO THEIR MEDICINAL VALUE, THE SEEDS
CAN BE ROASTED, GROUND AND USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR
COFFEE. (MILK THISDE IS A RELATIVE OF CHICORY, WHICH IS
ANOTHER COFFEE SUBSTITUTE.)
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL ABUSE IN THIS
COUNTRY, I SOMETIMES HAVE A FANTASY ABOUT GETTING
RICH BY SELLING MY BEER BEANS, A MIXTURE OF 20
PARTS (BY WEIGHT) ROASTED MILK THISTLE SEEDS, SOYBEANS (WHICH ARE REPUTED TO CURB THE DESIRE FOR
ALCOHOL) AND GINKGO NUTS (PROVEN TO SPEED ALCOHOL
METABOLISM). FD ROAST THESE AND OFFER THEM TO
HEAVY-DRINKING FRIENDS.
V*V SCHISANDRA (SCHISANDRA CHINENSIS).
WIDELY USED IN CHINESE MEDICINE AS A MALE TONIC,
THIS HERB ALSO HAS STRONG LIVER-PROTECTING PROPERTIES,
ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT
MILK TFIISTIE
YOU CAN GROW MILK THISTLE IN
YOUR HOME GARDEN OR

TRY ADDING YOUNG MILK THISTLE LEAVES, CARROTS AND DANDELION FLOWERS. USE GINGER
AND TURMERIC IN THE DRESSING.
PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. CHINESE DOCTORS USE ITS EXTRACTS EFFECTIVELY
TO TREAT VIRAL HEPATITIS AND OTHER LIVER
AILMENTS. THE SEEDS CONTAIN MORE THAN
A DOZEN LIVER-PROTECTIVE COMPOUNDS.
I REALLY WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
ONE DAY SCHISANDRA IS RIGHT UP THERE
WITH MILK THISTLE AS A TOP HERB FOR LIVER
PHIILIHPWIWIIIWNIIIMIPIIE~ COMPLAINTS. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND
THE DRIED BERRIES IN SOME HERB SHOPS
AND HEALTH FOOD STORES. IN CHINA, PEOPLE TAKE APPROXIMATELY ONE TO SEVEN TEASPOONS A DAY FOR UP TO A MONTH AFTER THE HEPATITIS HAS SUBSIDED.
V>J^ TAMARIND (TAMARINDUS INDIE A). IN LATIN AMERICA, TAMARIND JUICE IS
THE CHASER OF CHOICE WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. THAT'S BECAUSE IT
HAS A REPUTATION FOR PREVENTING HANGOVER. HAVING TESTED IT ON OCCASION, I THINK IT
HELPS. THIS STRENGTHENS MY SUSPICIONS THAT TAMARIND JUST MIGHT HELP PROTECT THE
LIVER. THESE SUSPICIONS WERE AT LEAST PARTIALLY CONFIRMED BY A STUDY SHOWING THAT
EXTRACTS OF TAMARIND PREVENTED LIVER DAMAGE IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS THAT WERE
GIVEN LIVER-DAMAGING CHEMICALS.
THE SUGARY PULP AROUND THE SEEDS IS USED TO MAKE A SWEETENED BEVERAGE
THAT IS CONSUMED MORE AS A FOOD THAN A MEDICINE. I DRINK TWO GLASSES A DAY IF IT
IS AVAILABLE. SO FAR, HOWEVER, I HAVE FOUND THE DRIED PULP ONLY IN A FEW LATIN
AMERICAN MARKETS. HAPPY HUNTING.
VV CHICORY (CICHORIUM INTYBUS). ACETAMINOPHEN IN HIGH DOSES IS TOXIC
TO THE LIVER, AND IF THE DOSES ARE HIGH ENOUGH, IT CAN BE FATAL. IN ONE STUDY, 70 PERCENT OF MICE GIVEN CHICORY EXTRACTS SURVIVED A DOSE OF ACETAMINOPHEN THAT KILLED
100 PERCENT OF UNTREATED ANIMALS. I'M NOT SURPRISED, SINCE CHICORY IS RELATED TO
MILK THISTLE.
FOR HOME MEDICATION, I DIG MY OWN ROOTS, SCORCH AND PULVERIZE THEM TO
MAKE A CHICORY "COFFEE" AND DRINK TWO TO FOUR CUPS A DAY. CHICORY MAKES A
WONDERFUL, CAFFEINE-FREE SUBSTITUTE FOR COFFEE. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO THIS MUCH
TROUBLE, HOWEVER. STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS OF THE ROOTS ARE AVAILABLE IN HERB
SHOPS, HEALTH FOOD STORES AND SOME MARKETS.
VV CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI, THIS
CHINESE HERB IS REVERED IN THE ORIENT AS AN AID FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH. IT ALSO HELPS
PROTECT THE LIVER, APPARENTLY BY HELPING IT USE MORE OXYGEN. CHINESE HERBAL PHYSICIANS FAVOR IT FOR TREATING CIRRHOSIS.
THE USUAL RECOMMENDATION IS TO TAKE TWO TO SIX TEASPOONS A DAY IN TEAS,
TINCTURES OR PILLS FOR AS MUCH AS A MONTH. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU'LL FIND

THIS IS A GRAB-BAG TEA RECIPE MADE WITH
HERBS THAT REPORTEDLY HAVE LIVER-PROTECTIVE BENEFITS. MIX TO TASTE: LICORICE, DANDELION, CHICORY, TURMERIC AND GINGER. IF
YOU LIKE, YOU CAN ALSO ADD ANISE, CARAWAY,
CELERY SEED, DILL, CLOVE, FENNEL, PEPPERMINT, ROSEMARY AND VANILLA BEAN. YOU CAN
MIX UP A JAR OF DRIED HERBS AND KEEP THE
MIXTURE HANDY FOR WHENEVER YOU WANT AN
HERBAL TEA.
CHINESE ANGELICA IN CHINESE HERB SHOPS AND SOME HEALTH FOOD STORES. (DO NOT
TAKE THIS HERB IF YOU ARE PREGNANT, HOWEVER.)
VV JAVANESE TURMERI C (CURCUMA XANTHORRHIZA). IN ASIAN FOLKLORE,
THIS HERB HAS BEEN HIGHLY REGARDED FOR CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE LIVER, PARTICULARLY GALLSTONES AND JAUNDICE. TAIWANESE SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED WHY: EXTRACTS OF THIS YELLOW ROOT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY PROTECTIVE FOR THE LIVER. YOU PROBABLY
WON'T FIND THIS HERB EXCEPT IN IN- Y—
DONESIAN OR OTHER SOUTH ASIAN MARKETS, BUT YOU MAY WELL HAVE SUCH A
MARKET IN YOUR AREA.
IF YOU CAN FIND IT, I SUGGEST
TAKING UP TO FIVE TEASPOONS A DAY FOR
A MONTH. HAVE IT WITH FOOD OR TEA.
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA
GLABRA)* THE ACTIVE COMPOUND IN
LICORICE ROOT, GLYCYRRHIZIN, INHIBITS
LIVER CELL INJURY CAUSED BY MANY
CHEMICALS AND IS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF CIRRHOSIS AND CHRONIC
HEPATITIS, ESPECIALLY IN JAPAN. UNFORTUNATELY, THE JAPANESE INJECT IT, WHICH I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
RUSSIAN STUDIES SUGGEST THAT AN HERBAL COMBINATION THAT INCLUDES LICORICE,
PEPPERMINT, ROSE, TANSY AND STINGING NETTLE CAN HELP STABILIZE LIVER CELL MEMBRANES IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, THUS PROTECTING THE ANIMALS FROM LIVER DAMAGE.
CLOSER TO HOME, NOTED NATUROPATHS JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF
BASTYR COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHY IN SEATTLE, AND MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHORS
OF A TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL MEDICINE, MENTION WELL-DESIGNED CLINICAL TRIALS
SHOWING GLYCYRRHIZIN TO BE QUITE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING VIRAL HEPATITIS.
YOU CAN BUY STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS AT HEALTH FOOD STORES. FOLLOW THE PACKAGE
DIRECTIONS.
V BOTTLE GOURD (LAGENARIA SIC ERARIA). SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN CHAPEL HILL HAVE FOUND THAT IN EXPERIMENTAL
ANIMALS, A DEFICIENCY OF THE B VITAMIN CHOLINE CAUSES LIVER DAMAGE AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIVER CANCER. WHETHER CHOLINE CAN HELP HEAL THE
HUMAN LIVER IS UNCERTAIN, BUT IT CAN'T HURT TO GET A LITTLE MORE OF THIS NUTRIENT.
ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, THE BEST SOURCE OF CHOLINE IS BOTTLE GOURD (1.6
PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS). EAT BOTTLE GOURD AS YOU WOULD SQUASH. IF YOU
CAN'T FIND IT AT MARKETS NEAR YOU, YOU MIGHT CONSIDER GROWING YOUR OWN. OTHER
HERBS HIGH IN CHOLINE INCLUDE FENUGREEK LEAVES, SHEPHERD'S PURSE, HOREHOUND,

V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE)* ACCORDING TO RESEARCH BY YOURS TRULY,
ALONG WITH MOLECULAR BIOLOGIST STEPHEN BECKSTROM-STERNBERG, PH.D., GINGER CONTAINS EIGHT LIVER-PROTECTING COMPOUNDS. I WON'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IT COULD TREAT
HEPATITIS, BUT IF YOU LOVE GINGER, AS I DO, YOU GET A BTTLE LIVER PROTECTION EVERY TIME
YOU USE IT IN COOKING OR TEA.
V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). TEA IS CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING ACUTE
INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS, NOTE DR. LEUNG AND ARKANSAS HERBALIST STEVEN FOSTER IN THE
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS. IF I HAD HEPATITIS, I'D DRINK TWO TO
FOUR CUPS A DAY.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). THIS SPICE, OFTEN INCLUDED IN CURRIES,
CONTAINS SEVERAL RELATED COMPOUNDS THAT PROTECT THE LIVER. IF I HAD HEPATITIS, I
WOULD ADD MORE TURMERIC TO MY COOKING.
LYME DISEASE
P
LINY THE ELDER, A ROMAN NATURALIST OF THE FIRST CENTURY A.D., MADE NO
ATTEMPT TO HIDE HIS LOATHING: "TICKS ARE THE FOULEST AND NASTIEST CREATURES THAT BE," HE SAID. SO JUST IMAGINE HOW MUCH CONTEMPT HE'D HAVE TODAY
FOR THE DEER TICKS THAT ARE NOW KNOWN TO BE CARRIERS OF LYME DISEASE.
MY HERBAL VINEYARD IN MARYLAND IS A LUSH SIX-ACRE SPREAD FILLED WITH UPWARD OF 300 SPECIES OF HERBS, SHRUBS, TREES AND WELCOME WEEDS. IT HAS ATTRACTED VISITORS (AND TELEVISION CREWS) FROM AROUND THE WORLD. IT HAS ALSO
ATTRACTED LESS WELCOME GUESTS, NOTABLY THE DEER THAT BRING THEIR UNWELCOME
HITCHHIKERS, DEER TICKS.
NOT TOO LONG AGO, AFTER A THREE-HOUR VIDEO SESSION OUT IN MY GINSENG PATCH
WITH ME SHOWING OFF MY SIBERIAN GINSENG PLANTS AND TALKING ABOUT THIS HERB, I
SWATTED REFLEXIVELY AT SOMETHING TICKLING MY THIGH. IT WENT SPLAT! AND WHILE
THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO IDENTIFY, WHAT REMAINED LOOKED VAGUELY TICKLIKE.
A DAY LATER, A SMALL RED SPOT APPEARED ON MY THIGH. IT GREW TO LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE CHARACTERISTIC BULL'S-EYE RASH CAUSED BY THE TICKBOME BACTERIA
BORRELIA BURGDORFERI, WHICH CAUSE LYME DISEASE. BY THE NEXT DAY, THE BULL'SEYE HAD BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED, MEASURING NEARLY THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER.
SO I TOOK SOME ECHINACEA AND GARLIC.
314
LYME DISEAS E
THE DAY AFTER THAT, MY WIFE, PEGGY, COERCED ME INTO VISITING OUR HMO.
WITHOUT THE TICK, THEY COULDN'T TEST FOR BORRELIA, SO THEY COULDN'T BE CERTAIN THAT
I HAD LYME DISEASE. BUT ALL THE PHYSICAL SIGNS POINTED IN THAT DIRECTION. THE
DOCTOR RECOMMENDED A COURSE OF DOXICYCLINE (BIO-TAB, MONODOX), A BACTERICIDAL ANTIBIOTIC, JUST IN CASE.
ANTIBIOTICS ANA HERBS TO THE RESCUE
WE PICKED UP THE PRESCRIPTION, BUT I WAVERED ABOUT TAKING IT. DOXICYCLINE
CAN MAKE THE SKIN MORE SUN-SENSITIVE, LEADING TO RASHES. AND I COULDN'T REALLY
STAY OUT OF THE SUN BECAUSE I HAD YET ANOTHER VIDEO CREW DUE FOR YET ANOTHER
TOUR OF THE HERBAL VINEYARD.
I WEIGHED MY OPTIONS. I COULD TAKE THE ANTIBIOTIC AND TAKE MY CHANCES IN
THE SUN. I COULD OPT FOR AN HERBAL ALTERNATIVE—ECHINACEA, FOR EXAMPLE—
HOPING TO BOOST MY IMMUNE SYSTEM FOR ITS CONFRONTATION WITH BORRELIA, PLUS
TAKE ANTIBIOTIC GARLIC TABLETS TO FIGHT THE BACTERIA. OR I COULD COMBINE THE CONVENTIONAL AND HERBAL MEDICINES.
AFTER CONSIDERABLE SOUL-SEARCHING, I WENT WITH THE COMBINATION APPROACH:
DOXICYCLINE PLUS GARLIC CAPSULES, EQUIVALENT TO 1,200 MILLIGRAMS OF FRESH GARLIC
A DAY. I ALSO TOOK SIX ECHINACEA CAPSULES A DAY, EACH CONTAINING 450 MILLIGRAMS
OF THE IMMUNE-BOOSTING ROOT, AND I JUICED UP SOME CARROTS AND TOMATOES. THESE
VEGETABLES ARE RICH IN VITAMIN A-FAMILY CAROTENOIDS, AND A GOOD DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CAROTENOIDS HELP FIGHT INFECTION. AND OF COURSE I ADDED
PLENTY OF FRESH GARLIC WHILE I HAD THE CARROTS AND TOMATOES IN THE JUICER.
I FINISHED MY THREE-WEEK DOXICYCLINE REGIMEN IN NASHVILLE, AND I EVEN SANG A
SONG ABOUT THE ANTIBIOTIC AT OPRYLAND. BY THEN THE BULL'S-EYE HAD DISAPPEARED, AND
I SHOWED NO SIGNS OF LYME DISEASE. WE'LL NEVER KNOW WHETHER I REALLY NEEDED THE
GARLIC OR THE DOXICYCLINE. BUT I SURELY DIDN'T NEED THE CRIPPLING ARTHRITIS THAT OFTEN
ENSUES WITH LYME DISEASE.
BEWARE TRIE BULLS-EYE
LYME DISEASE, NAMED FOR THE TOWN OF OLD LYME, CONNECTICUT, WHERE IT WAS
FIRST IDENTIFIED ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, IS A ZOONOSIS, A HUMAN INFECTION CAUSED BY AN
ANIMAL-BORNE PATHOGEN OR INFECTIOUS AGENT. HOW DID THIS RELATIVELY NEW DISEASE
APPEAR? BLAME IT ON REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. MORE AND MORE HOUSING IS BEING
BUILT IN AND NEAR WILDLIFE AREAS, BRINGING DEER AND PEOPLE INTO CLOSER CONTACT.
SINCE BOBCATS AND OTHER SUCH PREDATORS ARE RARE, THE DEER POPULATIONS HAVE INCREASED, AND THERE ARE MORE HUNGRY DEER THAN EVER MUNCHING OUR GARDENS.
315
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
LYME DISEASE GENERALLY CAUSES THE CHARACTERISTIC BULL'S-EYE SKIN RASH, BUT
IN ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF CASES, NO RASH APPEARS. AFTER A FEW WEEKS TO SEVERAL
MONTHS, SOME 70 PERCENT OF THOSE WHO REMAIN UNTREATED SUFFER BACTERIAL INVASIONS OF THE JOINTS AND POSSIBLY OTHER ORGANS, NOTABLY THE CENTRAL NERVOUS
SYSTEM, CAUSING CHRONIC ARTHRITIS.
CURRENTLY, IN AREAS WITHOUT MAJOR LYME DISEASE PROBLEMS, 1 TO 2 PERCENT OF
PEOPLE SHOW ANTIBODIES TO BORRELIA, SIGNIFYING THAT THEY HAVE AT SOME POINT
BEEN EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS. IN SOME LYME-ENDEMIC AREAS, HOWEVER, THE FIGURE
IS 10 PERCENT.
BECAUSE OF ALL THE PUBLICITY ABOUT LYME DISEASE, WE NOT ONLY HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF THIS INFECTION, WE ALSO HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF OVERDIAGNOSIS. DOCTORS ARE
TOO WILLING TO DIAGNOSE LYME DISEASE, APPARENTLY BECAUSE THE EARLY SYMPTOMS—SKIN RASH, HEADACHE, FEVER, NAUSEA AND MUSCLE PAIN—ARE COMMON TO
SO MANY OTHER MALADIES.
IN A 1995 SURVEY BY THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, ONLY ABOUT HALF OF
THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH LYME DISEASE ACTUALLY HAD IT. IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN THERE
MAY BE ONLY 5,000 INFECTIONS A YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, NOT THE 10,000 FIGURE
YOU SEE BANDIED ABOUT. DID I REALLY HAVE LYME DISEASE? I THINK SO, BUT THESE
STATISTICS CERTAINLY MAKE ME WONDER.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR LYME DISEASE
ONE THING I DON'T WONDER ABOUT IS MY DECISION TO COMBINE MY CONVENTIONAL
MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH HERBS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HELPFUL HERBS THAT YOU AND
YOUR DOCTOR MIGHT CONSIDER USING IN ADDITION TO ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU'RE RECEIVING FOR THE DISEASE. AND TWO OF THEM, GARLIC AND MOUNTAIN MINT, MIGHT PREVENT
THE DISEASE, BECAUSE THEY ACT AS NATURAL TICK REPELLENTS.
V\V ECHINACEA {ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN
AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE
UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, IS OUTSPOKEN IN HIS SUPPORT OF ECHINACEA,
NOTING THAT THE HERB HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED AS AN IMMUNOSTIMULANT AND THAT
IT INCREASES THE BODY'S RESISTANCE TO BACTERIAL INFECTION.
A CENTURY AGO, HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THE RECOMMENDED DOSE OF ECHINACEA RHIZOME AND ROOT WAS ONE GRAM (APPROXIMATELY A HALF-TEASPOON) PER DAY.
DURING MY LYME TREATMENT, I TOOK ABOUT FOUR GRAMS (TWO TEASPOONS)—THAT'S
HOW AFRAID OF BORRELIA I WAS.
ECHINACEA COMES IN TEAS, TINCTURES AND CAPSULES. I OFTEN ADD A DROPPER OR
TWO OF TINCTURE TO JUICES OR BEVERAGE TEAS. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR
TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.) TO TREAT MY
SUSPECTED LYME INFECTION, THOUGH, I TOOK CAPSULES TO GET A LOT DOWN QUICKLY.
316
MACULA R DEGENERATIO N
V"*^ GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). LOUIS PASTEUR WAS THE FIRST TO DESCRIBE THE
ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT OF GARLIC JUICES. MORE RECENTLY, WE'VE FOUND THAT GARLIC EVEN
WORKS AGAINST MANY ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT STRAINS OF BACTERIA, AND GIVEN THE SPEED
WITH WHICH BACTERIA BECOME RESISTANT, I DOUBT THAT IT WILL BE LONG BEFORE BORRELIA DEVELOPS RESISTANCE TO DOXICYCLINE.
DUTCH STUDIES SUGGEST THAT GETTING THE BEST ANTIBIOTIC ACTION FROM GARLIC REQUIRES INGESTING 5 TO 15 AVERAGE-SIZE CLOVES A DAY. IT'S HARD TO GET THAT MUCH
FRESH GARLIC DOWN, BUT I FIND THAT JUICING IT WITH CARROTS WORKS.
IF YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF CONSUME THAT MUCH GARLIC, DON'T DESPAIR. I
BELIEVE THAT WHILE LOWER DOSES MAY NOT ERADICATE INFECTION BY THEMSELVES, THEY
CAN STILL HELP WHEN COMBINED WITH OTHER HERBS AND ANTIBIOTICS.
V W MOUNTAIN MINT (PYCNANTHEMUM MUTICUM), A WELCOME WEED AT
HERBAL VINEYARD, THIS PLANT PROVIDES ME WITH MY TICK REPELLENT, DAY AFTER DAY, IN
SUMMER. WHEN I SPEND TIME OUTDOORS, I CRUSH MOUNTAIN MINT LEAVES AND RUB MY
LEGS WITH THE JUICE, WHICH IS WELL-ENDOWED WITH THE BUG- AND TICK-REPELLING COMPOUND PULEGONE. BUT ON THE FATEFUL AFTERNOON OF MY TICK ENCOUNTER, I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE SPENDING SO LONG OUTSIDE WITH THAT CAMERA CREW, AND I DID NOT USE THE HERB.
I WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. (IT'S PROBABLY BEST NOT TO USE THIS HERB ON YOUR
SKIN IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, HOWEVER.)
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). ONCE I QUERIED MY DATABASE ABOUT
WHICH HERB CONTAINED THE MOST BACTERICIDAL COMPOUNDS. THE ANSWER WAS LICORICE,
WHICH IS UP TO 33 PERCENT ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. SMALL
WONDER THAT THE CHINESE HAVE USED LICORICE FOR CENTURIES TO TREAT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS SUCH AS TUBERCULOSIS. I OFTEN USE LICORICE ROOTS, WHICH ARE ALSO ANTIVIRAL, TO
TREAT BOTH VIRAL AND BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SAPONINS, WHICH
ARE FOUND IN LICORICE, ALSO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER ANTIBIOTIC COMPOUNDS.
OTHER HERBS WELL-ENDOWED WITH BACTERICIDAL COMPOUNDS, IN DESCENDING
ORDER OF POTENCY, INCLUDE THYME, HOPS, OREGANO AND ROSEMARY. SOUNDS LIKE THE
MAKINGS OF A GOOD TEA, WHICH CAN BE SWEETENED WITH LICORICE EXTRACT.
MACULAR DEGENERATION
B
EING AN ALABAMA-BORN REDNECK WHO WAS RAISED ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, I'M HAPPY TO TELL ALL WHO WILL LISTEN THAT THE ANTIOXIDANTS AND
OTHER PLANT CHEMICALS (PHYTOCHEMICALS) IN THESE FOODS HELP PREVENT HEART DIS317
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
EASE AND CANCER. OF COURSE, NOWADAYS THAT'S PROBABLY NOT NEWS TO YOU. BUT
MAYBE HERE'S A NEW ONE FOR YOU: DID YOU KNOW THAT ANTIOXIDANT NUTRIENTS ALSO
HELP SAVE EYESIGHT?
I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT IF YOU EAT YOUR VEGGIES YOU'LL HAVE GOOD VISION WHEN
YOU'RE AS OLD AS METHUSELAH. BUT IF THE STUDIES I'VE REVIEWED ARE CORRECT, YOU'LL
CERTAINLY HAVE BETTER VISION THAN YOU WOULD IF YOU ATE JUNK FOOD INSTEAD.
HERE'S WHY: THERE IS SOME INDICATION THAT CELL DAMAGE CAUSED BY HIGHLY
REACTIVE OXYGEN MOLECULES (FREE RADICALS) PLAYS A ROLE IN AN EYE CONDITION
KNOWN AS MACULAR DEGENERATION. ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT NEUTRALIZE
THESE FREE RADICALS AND PREVENT THEM FROM DOING HARM. AND FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, ESPECIALLY LEAFY VEGETABLES, ARE SIMPLY YOUR BEST SOURCES OF THESE BENEFICIAL SUBSTANCES.
THE MACULA IS THE CENTRAL AND MOST SENSITIVE PORTION OF THE RETINA, THE
NERVE-RICH AREA IN THE BACK OF THE EYE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR SIGHT. FOR UNKNOWN
REASONS, AFTER AROUND AGE 60, THE MACULA BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN. AS IT DEGENERATES, CENTRAL VISION AND FINE DETAIL PERCEPTION DETERIORATE. (PERIPHERAL VISION
REMAINS UNAFFECTED.)
MACULAR DEGENERATION AFFECTS MORE THAN 25 PERCENT OF AMERICANS OVER 65
YEARS OLD. IT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN THE ELDERLY. YOU'RE AT SOMEWHAT GREATER RISK OF HAVING MACULAR DEGENERATION IF YOU ARE FARSIGHTED OR SMOKE
CIGARETTES. PEOPLE WITH LIGHT-COLORED EYES AND A FAMILY HISTORY OF THE CONDITION
ARE ALSO AT GREATER RISK.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR MACULAR DEGENERATION
CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPIES DON'T HELP MUCH WITH MACULAR DEGENERATION, WHICH MAKES NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES LOOK ALL THE MORE APPEALING. QUITE
A FEW FOODS AND HERBS MIGHT HELP.
W V BILBERRY {VACCINIUM MYRTMUS). THIS FRUIT AND ITS RELATIVES, BLUEBERRY,
CRANBERRY, HUCKLEBERRY, BLACKBERRY, GRAPE, PLUM AND WILD CHERRY, HAVE BEEN USED
TRADITIONALLY FOR PROBLEMS WITH VISUAL ACUITY. AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS VALIDATED
THIS FOLK MEDICINE APPROACH.
ALL OF THESE FRUITS CONTAIN COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS ANTHOCYANOSIDES, WHICH
ARE POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS. IN ONE STUDY, DAILY TREATMENT WITH 400 MILLIGRAMS OF
BILBERRY AND 20 MILLIGRAMS OF THE FAMOUS ANTIOXIDANT BETA-CAROTENE IMPROVED
MANY PARTICIPANTS' NIGHT VISION AND ENLARGED THEIR VISUAL FIELDS.
BILBERRY ANTHOCYANOSIDES ALSO STRENGTHEN THE CAPILLARIES IN THE RETINA,
WHICH HELPS SLOW MACULAR DEGENERATION. HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL
MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND
HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, SUGGESTS A TEA OF BILBERRY, BUTCHER'S BROOM, CENTELLA
318
MACULA R DEGENERATIO N
BILBERRY H
BILBERRIES CONTAIN A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT THAT WAS ONCE USED BY
EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY HERBALISTS AS
AN INGREDIENT IN MOUTHWASH.
AND GINGER FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SEVERAL
TYPES OF MACULAR DEGENERATION. I AGREE.
I SUGGEST USING A LOT OF BILBERRIES AND
ADDING THE OTHER HERBS BASED ON WHATEVER
YOU HAVE ON HAND AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE TASTE. STEEP THE HERBS IN BOILING WATER
FOR 15 MINUTES; YOU CAN DRINK A CUP OF THIS
EYE TEA UP TO FOUR TIMES A DAY.
VV COLLARD GREENS (BRASSICA OLERACEA), SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA)
AND OTHE R VEGETABLES. ONE STUDY, DONE
BY OPHTHALMOLOGIST JOHANNA SEDDON, M.D.,
OF THE MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY
IN BOSTON, INVOLVED SURVEYING ALMOST 900
PEOPLE, 326 OF WHOM HAD MACULAR DEGENERATION. DR. SEDDON FOUND THAT EATING ANTIOXIDANT-RICH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT LEAST FIVE
TIMES A WEEK CUT THE RISK OF MACULAR DEGENERATION IN HALF.
COLLARD GREENS, THE POPULAR SOUL FOOD, AND SPINACH, POPEYE'S FAVORITE FOOD,
STOOD OUT IN DR. SEDDON'S STUDY. THESE VEGETABLES CONTAIN THE BENEFICIAL COMPOUNDS LUTEIN AND ZEAXANTHIN. VEGETABLES THAT CONTAIN SIMILAR COMPOUNDS THAT
MAY PROVIDE EYE PROTECTION INCLUDE BOK CHOY, BROCCOLI, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CABBAGE, KALE, KOHLRABI, MUSTARD GREENS, RADISHES, TURNIP GREENS AND WATERCRESS.
DR. SEDDON'S STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT TAKING VITAMIN C AND E SUPPLEMENTS
DIDN'T DO MUCH TO HELP PREVENT MACULAR DEGENERATION, EVEN THOUGH BOTH ARE
POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS. THIS STRENGTHENS MY ONGOING ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE BETTER
OFF WITH WHOLE, NUTRIENT-RICH FOODS AND HERBS RATHER THAN SINGLE-NUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTS.
IF I HAD MACULAR DEGENERATION OR ANY RISK FACTORS FOR IT, I'D DINE REGULARLY
ON MY CRUCI-FIX, A STEAMED MIXTURE OF ALL THE CRUCIFEROUS VEGETABLES I HAD ON
HAND.
W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO EXTRACTS HELP MAINTAIN GOOD BLOOD
FLOW TO THE RETINA.
IN ONE SIX-MONTH STUDY, PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED 80 MILLIGRAMS OF A STANDARDIZED GINKGO EXTRACT TWICE DAILY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THEIR LONG-DISTANCE VISION. ANOTHER STUDY SUGGESTS THAT GINKGO EXTRACT MAY EVEN REVERSE DAMAGE IN
THE RETINA. TO ME THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOU SHOULD TRY MIXING GINKGO WITH ANTIOXIDANT MINT TEAS.
319
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
GINKGO LEAVES ACTUALLY CONTAIN VERY LITTLE OF THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS. THE
BEST WAY TO GET THE FULL BENEFITS OF THIS HERB IS TO USE A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT—A
50:1 PREPARATION, WHICH MEANS THAT 50 POUNDS OF LEAVES HAVE BEEN PROCESSED
TO MAKE 1 POUND OF EXTRACT. (I OCCASIONALLY ADD A FEW LEAVES TO MY BLENDED
FRESH FRUIT JUICES ANYWAY.) THE SUGGESTED DOSE OF STANDARDIZED EXTRACT IS 150
TO 300 MILLIGRAMS A DAY. (IN AMOUNTS HIGHER THAN 240 MILLIGRAMS, GINKGO MAY
CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS, SO IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE
SYMPTOMS, OPT FOR A LOWER DOSE.)
W PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). A GOOD DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SOYBEANS HELP PREVENT THE RETINAL BREAKDOWN THAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WITH DIABETES, A
CONDITION KNOWN AS DIABETIC RETINOPATHY. IT SEEMS THAT THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IN
SOYBEANS IS GENISTEIN. IF GENISTEIN HELPS PREVENT DIABETIC RETINOPATHY, IT ALSO MIGHT
HELP PREVENT MACULAR DEGENERATION.
MANY OTHER LEGUMES BESIDES SOYBEANS CONTAIN A GENEROUS PORTION OF GENISTEIN. FROM A TASTE STANDPOINT, I GO FOR PEANUTS, WHICH ACTUALLY CONTAIN MORE
GENISTEIN THAN SOYBEANS. IN FACT, I MUNCH ON PEANUTS NEARLY EVERY DAY. SPANISH
PEANUTS ARE ALSO WELL-ENDOWED WITH ANTIOXIDANT COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS PROCYANIDINS.
V CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM). CLOVE OIL IS A POWERFUL ANTIOXIDANT.
STUDIES SHOW THAT IT HELPS PREVENT THE BREAKDOWN IN THE RETINA OF A SUBSTANCE
KNOWN AS DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID. THIS ACTION HELPS PRESERVE VISION IN OLD AGE. I'D
SUGGEST ADDING ONE OR TWO DROPS OF OIL TO ANTIOXIDANT MINT TEAS AND ENJOYING UP TO
FOUR CUPS A DAY.
V WOLFBERRY (LYCIUM CHINESE). THIS IS A TRADITIONAL CHINESE TREATMENT
FOR BLURRED VISION AND OTHER PROBLEMS WITH SIGHT. IN ONE STUDY, PARTICIPANTS CONSUMED ABOUT TWO OUNCES (50 GRAMS) OF WOLFBERRIES A DAY. THEIR VISION IMPROVED
SIGNIFICANTLY. WOLFBERRIES ARE HIGH IN ANTIOXIDANTS AND BENEFICIAL PLANT PIGMENTS
KNOWN AS CAROTENOIDS.
MENOPAUSE
H
ERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM A LETTER I RECEIVED IN 1991: "I AM A 59-YEAROLD WOMAN WHO HAS GONE THROUGH MENOPAUSE. AS A RESULT, MY SKIN
HAS BECOME EXTREMELY THIN, AND MY HAIR HAS THINNED AS WELL. I WOULD LIKE TO
INQUIRE IF THERE ARE ANY NATURAL ALTERNATIVES TO HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
320
MENOPAUSE
(HRT). I FEEL VERY UNSURE OF HRT AND DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT. I FEAR IT HAS TOO
MANY RISKS."
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MORE THAN 10,000 LETTERS I RECEIVED THAT YEAR, WHICH
WAS A BUMPER-CROP YEAR FOR MAIL BECAUSE I DID A THREE-MINUTE SPOT ON FOOD
PHARMACY ON THE CBS NATIONAL MORNING SHOW. THE PHONES RANG OFF THE HOOK AT
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA), WHERE I WORKED AT THE TIME. AND
ALL OF THE USDA SECRETARIES, MAIL STAFF AND OPERATORS—AS WELL AS THE BOSSES—
REGRETTED MY THREE MINUTES OF FAME. OF COURSE, I DIDN'T. IT WAS ANOTHER CHANCE
TO GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT HERBS AND OTHER NATURAL MEDICINES.
ORMONE QUESTION
I, TOO, HAVE MISGIVINGS ABOUT HRT. ALTHOUGH THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE ESTROGEN EVIDENTLY RELIEVES HOT FLASHES, VAGINAL DRYNESS AND OTHER DISCOMFORTS OF
MENOPAUSE, A GOOD DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT MAY INCREASE A WOMAN'S RISK
OF GETTING BREAST CANCER. (RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT INCLUDING PROGESTERONE
AS PART OF THE THERAPY MAY REDUCE THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER.)
I LIKE TO QUOTE ANDREW WEIL, M.D., AN HERB ADVOCATE WHO TEACHES AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL
HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, WHO WARNS FRIENDS CONTEMPLATING HRT: "YOU SHOULD AVOID ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT ALTOGETHER IF YOU ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF CANCER OF
THE BREAST OR REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, INCLUDING HAVING A PERSONAL OR FAMILY HISTORY OF THESE CANCERS OR OVARIAN CANCER. IF YOU DO DECIDE TO TAKE REPLACEMENT
THERAPY, USE A LOW DOSE OF ESTROGEN (1.25 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, MAXIMUM) AND
NEVER TAKE IT WITHOUT PROGESTERONE FOR AT LEAST PART OF THE MONTHLY CYCLE." THIS
SOUNDS LIKE GOOD ADVICE TO ME. IN FACT, IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO DR. WEIL. MANY GYNECOLOGISTS ALSO TAKE THIS APPROACH.
I KNOW A NATUROPATH WHO IS VERY OPPOSED TO HRT AND INSTEAD RECOMMENDS
EATING LOTS OF VEGGIES AND LEGUMES HIGH IN PHYTOESTROGENS, WHICH ARE ESTROGENLIKE COMPOUNDS. HE SAYS, "IF YOU ADD UP ALL THE WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS, THE NUMBER COMES TO OVER 100." MY FRIEND IS
AMAZED THAT ANY PHYSICIAN WOULD PRESCRIBE THIS THERAPY. STILL, THE VAST MAJORITY
OF DOCTORS DO PRESCRIBE HRT
WHY? MAINLY BECAUSE HRT ALSO REDUCES THE RISK OF HEART DISEASE AND OSTEOPOROSIS, WHICH POSE A GREATER RISK TO MANY WOMEN THAN BREAST CANCER. BUT IN
MY HUMBLE OPINION, THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO REDUCE THESE RISKS THAN TAKING
HRT.
MANY DOCTORS DISAGREE WITH ME, THOUGH. THIS IS A DECISION THAT YOU'LL HAVE
TO MAKE YOURSELF, AND I SUGGEST THAT YOU GET THE FULL PICTURE—PRO AND CON—

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
FROM YOUR OWN GYNECOLOGIST. (FOR MORE DETAILS ON HEART DISEASE, SEE PAGE 242;
FOR MORE ON OSTEOPOROSIS, SEE PAGE 339.)
WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES TO DANGEROUS DRUGS, THOSE APPROACHES SHOULD
BE GIVEN A CHANCE BEFORE YOU RESORT TO MORE DRASTIC, EXPENSIVE APPROACHES THAT
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE DAMAGING SIDE EFFECTS. I FEAR THAT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS THE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN PROVING THAT NATURAL APPROACHES TO MENOPAUSE, OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER, ARE SAFER AND MORE
EFFECTIVE THAN SYNTHETICS. I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THE NATURAL APPROACHES ARE
BETTER, AND FM NOT ALONE IN THAT OPINION. UNFORTUNATELY, FEW DOCTORS SHARE IT.
MIDLIFE DISCOMFORTS
MENOPAUSE MEANS THE CESSATION OF MENSTRUATION. MOST WOMEN EXPERIENCE
MENOPAUSE DURING THEIR LATE FORTIES AND EARLY FIFTIES. SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS
QUICKLY. MORE FREQUENTLY, IT TAKES A FEW YEARS FOR MENSTRUAL PERIODS TO CEASE.
AS MENOPAUSE DEVELOPS, ESTROGEN PRODUCTION DECLINES, OFTEN CAUSING ONE
OR MORE DISCOMFORTS: ANXIETY, BREAST TENDERNESS, DEPRESSION, DRY SKIN,
HEADACHE, HOT FLASHES, INCONTINENCE, INSOMNIA, IRRITABILITY, NERVOUSNESS, NIGHT
SWEATS AND VAGINAL DRYNESS.
OF THIS LIST, HOT FLASHES ARE MOST COMMON, AFFECTING ABOUT 85 PERCENT OF
MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. HOT FLASHES USUALLY OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING, BUT SOME
WOMEN NOTICE THAT EMOTIONAL STRESS, EXERCISE, ALCOHOL AND CERTAIN FOODS MAY
TRIGGER THEM.
TNE FABTUXMS PNYTOS
LET ME REMIND YOU THAT AS A BOTANIST, I CANNOT AND DO NOT PRESCRIBE. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IT WITHIN MY BOTANICAL PREROGATIVE TO OUTLINE THE RESEARCH ON
HERBAL AND NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES TO MENOPAUSE THAT I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO
SUGGEST TO MY WIFE OR DAUGHTER.
BUT BEFORE I MENTION SPECIFIC HERBS THAT CAN OFFER HELP, LET ME MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT DIET. HOT FLASHES AND OTHER MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS ARE RARE IN
VEGETARIAN CULTURES, ESPECIALLY AMONG PEOPLE WHO CONSUME A LOT OF LEGUMES,
LIKE BLACK BEANS, MUNG BEANS AND SOYBEANS.
WHY? BECAUSE BEANS AND MANY OTHER PLANTS HAVE MILD ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY,
THANKS TO PHYTOESTROGENS. THESE COMPOUNDS INCLUDE ISOFLAVONES, LIGNANS, PHYTOSTEROLS AND SAPONINS.
IN ADDITION TO ACTING LIKE ESTROGEN IN WOMEN WHOSE OWN SEX HORMONE PRODUCTION HAS DECLINED, PHYTOESTROGENS ALSO APPEAR TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ESTROGEN322
MENOPAUS E
LINKED CANCERS SUCH AS BREAST CANCER. ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT PHYTOESTROGENS ARE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING TUMORS OF THE BREAST TISSUE.
THE SOY FACTOR
WE USED TO THINK THAT ASIAN WOMEN HAD A LOW RATE OF BREAST CANCER SIMPLY
BECAUSE THEY EAT A LOW-FAT DIET. NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEIR SUBSTANTIAL INTAKE
OF LEGUMES LIKE SOY AND BEAN SPROUTS IS ALSO A REASON. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
PHYTOESTROGENS TO HELP PREVENT MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND AT THE SAME TIME
ALSO HELP PREVENT ILLNESSES ASSOCIATED WITH ESTROGEN?
PHYTOESTROGENS ARE WEAKER THAN THE BODY'S OWN ESTROGEN. IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, PHYTOESTROGENS COMPETE WITH WOMEN'S OWN, MORE POTENT ESTROGEN, REDUCING THE TOTAL EFFECTS OF ESTROGEN. BUT AS WOMEN'S ESTROGEN
PRODUCTION FALLS, PHYTOESTROGENS SUPPLEMENT THIS HORMONE.
PUT ANOTHER WAY, WHEN WOMEN HAVE TOO MUCH BIOLOGICAL ESTROGEN, PHYTOESTROGENS LOWER THE BURDEN; WHEN THEY HAVE TOO LITTLE, PHYTOESTROGENS PINCH-HIT.
I KNOW OF NO EVIDENCE THAT PHYTOESTROGENS IN MODERATION CAUSE HARM. ONE
CUP OF SOYBEANS (ABOUT 200 GRAMS) PROVIDES ABOUT 300 MILLIGRAMS OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT CLASS OF PHYTOESTROGENS, ISOFLAVONES. THAT AMOUNT COULD PROVIDE
ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT OF ONE TABLET OF PREMARIN, THE COMMONLY PRESCRIBED SYNTHETIC HORMONE USED IN ERT.
STUDIES SHOW THAT WOMEN WHO REGULARLY EAT SOY FOODS HAVE FEW HOT FLASHES,
AND THEY HAVE MORE CELLS IN THEIR VAGINAL LININGS. THESE EXTRA CELLS OFFSET THE
VAGINAL DRYNESS AND IRRITATION THAT ARE SO COMMON IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.
SOYBEANS ARE NOT THE ONLY BEANS HIGH IN ISOFLAVONES. MOST BEANS AND MANY
OTHER LEGUMES CONTAIN REASONABLE AMOUNTS. I FEEL THAT LITTLE HARM CAN BE DONE
BY ENJOYING A DIET RICH IN A DIVERSITY OF BEANS UNLESS YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO THEM OR
STRENUOUSLY OBJECT TO THE FLATUS THEY CAUSE. (I DON'T, BUT IF YOU'D LIKE SOME TECHNIQUES FOR REDUCING THE GAS-PRODUCING EFFECTS OF BEANS, SEE PAGE 200.)
GREEN PHARMACY FOR MENOPAUSE
IN ADDITION TO A HIGH-PHYTOESTROGEN VEGETARIAN DIET, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC
HERBS CAN HELP RELIEVE MANY SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MENOPAUSE. HERE'S MY
SELECTION.
W BLACK COHOSH (CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA). LONG RECOMMENDED FOR "FEMALE COMPLAINTS," THIS HERB CONTAINS ESTROGENIC SUBSTANCES THAT HELP RELIEVE
MENOPAUSE DISCOMFORTS, ESPECIALLY HOT FLASHES. IN ONE STUDY OF 110 MENOPAUSAL
WOMEN, HALF WERE GIVEN BLACK COHOSH ROOT EXTRACT, WHILE THE OTHER HALF TOOK AN INACTIVE PREPARATION (A PLACEBO). AFTER EIGHT WEEKS, BLOOD TESTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT
323
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY IN THE WOMEN TAKING THE HERB.
IN ANOTHER STUDY, WOMEN WITH VAGINAL DRYNESS DUE TO MENOPAUSE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR RELIEF WHETHER TAKING BLACK COHOSH OR PHARMACEUTICAL ESTROGEN.
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA).
LICORICE CONTAINS NATURAL ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS.
LIKE THE ISOFLAVONES IN SOY, GLYCYRRHIZIN, THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN LICORICE, APPEARS TO REDUCE ESTROGEN LEVELS IN WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE TOO HIGH AND
INCREASE THE LEVELS WHEN THEY'RE TOO LOW.
COULD LICORICE CANDY HELP WOMEN
WITH MENOPAUSAL DISCOMFORTS? POSSIBLY, BUT READ THE LABEL. MOST AMERICAN LICORICE CONTAINS EXTRACTS OF
LICORICE PLUS ANISE, WHICH CONTAINS A
CHEMICAL (ANETHOLE) THAT IS LESS ESTROGENIC THAN GLYCYRRHIZIN. MANY HEALTH
FOOD STORES CARRY CANDIES MADE FROM
PURE LICORICE.
LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE
SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE
AMOUNTS, BUT LONG-TERM USE OR INGESTION OF LARGER AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER
RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. A SAFE DAILY
DOSE OF A TRUE LICORICE CONFECTION IS
SAID TO BE FIVE GRAMS, OR LESS THAN A
QUARTER-OUNCE. IT'S HARD TO STOP WHEN SOMETHING TASTES THAT GOOD, BUT YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO CONTROL YOURSELF.
V ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA). ALFALFA HAS DEMONSTRABLE ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY. THE LEAVES MAKE A PLEASANT-TASTING TEA. IF YOU HAVE LUPUS OR A FAMILY HISTORY
OF LUPUS, HOWEVER, STEER CLEAR OF ALFALFA SPROUTS. THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY
MAY TRIGGER LUPUS IN SENSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.
V CHASTEBERRY (VUEX AGNUS-CASTUS). THIS HERB HAS BEEN ENDORSED AS A
NORMALIZING HERB FOR FEMALE SEX HORMONES AND IS THOUGHT TO BE ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL DURING MENOPAUSAL CHANGES.
THE BIOCHEMISTRY IS COMPLICATED, BUT BASICALLY CHASTEBERRY REGULATES HORMONES INVOLVED IN THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE: IT INCREASES LUTEINIZING HORMONE PROBLACK COHOSH
THIS HERB GREW WILD IN THE OHIO RIVER
VALLEY AND WAS USED BY AMERICAN INDIAN
WOMEN FOR GYNECOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS AND
CHILDBIRTH.
324
MENSTRUA L CRAMP S
DUCTION AND INHIBITS THE RELEASE OF FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE. ALL OF THIS
TRANSLATES INTO A BENEFICIAL ESTROGENIC EFFECT.
V CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI,
CHINESE ANGELICA HAS AN AGE-OLD REPUTATION AS A WOMEN'S TONIC. BELIEVERS SWEAR
THAT IT RELIEVES HOT FLASHES AND VAGINAL DRYNESS AND IRRITATION, THUS AIDING WOMEN
DURING MENOPAUSE. WHILE THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC BACKUP FOR THIS ASSERTION, THE HERB
DOES HAVE CENTURIES OF FOLK USE GOING FOR IT. I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO RECOMMEND IT
TO FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS.
V RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE). THIS HERB CONTAINS 1 TO 2.5 PERCENT
ISOFLAVONES. IN ONE STUDY, POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WHO INGESTED CLOVER, FLAXSEED
AND SOY FOR TWO WEEKS HAD DEMONSTRABLY HIGHER ESTROGEN LEVELS, WHICH DECLINED
WHEN THEY WENT OFF THE SPECIAL DIET. SOME CLOVERS ARE SO ESTROGENIC THAT THEY CAUSE
SPONTANEOUS ABORTION IN CATTLE THAT OVERGRAZE ON THEM. RED CLOVER MAKES A
PLEASANT-TASTING TEA.
V STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING BORON. THERE'S MORE TO ESTROGEN ACTIVITY THAN THE HORMONE ITSELF. USDA
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TAKING AS LITTLE AS THREE MILLIGRAMS OF BORON CAN DOUBLE BLOOD
LEVELS OF CIRCULATING ESTROGEN. SO I'D RECOMMEND THAT POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AND
THOSE APPROACHING MENOPAUSE EAT FOODS HIGH IN THIS MINERAL.
ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, THE TOP BORON-CONTAINING FOODS, IN DESCENDING
ORDER OF POTENCY, INCLUDE STRAWBERRIES, PEACHES, CABBAGE, TOMATOES, DANDELION,
APPLES, ASPARAGUS, FIGS, POPPY SEEDS, BROCCOLI, PEARS, CHERRIES, BEETS, APRICOTS,
CURRANTS, PARSLEY, DILL AND CUMIN SEED.
WORKING WITH ALL THE ESTROGENIC AND BORON-CONTAINING PLANTS AND HERBS,
YOU CAN CONCOCT SOME INTERESTING SALADS AND VEGETABLE DISHES.
V ASSORTED HERBS. A NUMBER OF OTHER HERBS CONTAIN PHYTOESTROGENS THAT
COULD PROVE USEFUL IN HELPING WITH MENOPAUSE. THESE INCLUDE APPLES, CELERY
STALKS, DATES, ELDER, FALSE-UNICORN ROOT, FENNEL, HONDURAN SARSAPARILLA, LADY'S
SLIPPER, LIFEROOT, MEXICAN WILD YAMS, PASSION FLOWER, POMEGRANATES AND SASSAFRAS.
MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
T
HERE WE WERE, THREE INVESTIGATORS, EACH WITH AMERICAN INDIAN FAMILY
CONNECTIONS, GAZING AT A PATCH OF SQUAW VINE. ONE OF MY COMPANIONS
WAS A BONA FIDE LUMBEE INDIAN, WHOSE TRIBE LIVES NEAR THE BORDER BETWEEN
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA. THE OTHER WAS SCANDINAVIAN, BUT SHE WAS THE
MOTHER OF AN HONORARY ABENAKI (ONE WHO HAD BEEN ADOPTED INTO THE MASSA325
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CHUSETTS TRIBE). AND I AM THE CAUCASIAN GRANDFATHER OF THREE PART-CHEROKEE
GRANDCHILDREN.
WE GOT TO DISCUSSING THE TERM SQUAW VINE AS WE CONSIDERED THE PLANT, A
GROUND-HUGGING EVERGREEN VINELET WITH BRIGHT RED BERRIES. I HAD BEEN TOLD THAT
THERE WERE TWO POSSIBLE INTERPRETATIONS OF SQUAW IN THE COMMON NAMES OF
PLANTS: ONE, PERHAPS SEXIST, THAT IT WAS USED ONLY FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE ILLS,
AND THE OTHER, PERHAPS RACIST, THAT IT WAS ALTOGETHER USELESS.
THE LUMBEE DISCOUNTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS USELESS, SAYING THAT THE
INDIANS WOULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED TO USE SUCH A PLANT FOR MENSTRUAL DIFFICULTIES UNLESS IT WAS EFFECTIVE. HE AGREED WITH ME THAT THE WORD SQUAW DID NOT
SOUND RESPECTFUL OF INDIAN WOMEN.
WE COULDN'T RENAME THE PLANT, BECAUSE EVERY HERBALIST KNOWS IT AS SQUAW
VINE. BUT WE AGREED THAT FROM THEN ON, WE WOULD TAKE SQUAW TO MEAN USEFUL
AND BEAUTIFUL. STILL A BIT SEXIST, PERHAPS, BUT MUCH MORE POSITIVE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
THERE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A FEW HERBS, INCLUDING SQUAW VINE, THAT CAN HELP
EASE MONTHLY CRAMPS.
W V BLACK HAW (VIBURNUM PRUNIFOLIUM). UNDER THE
NAME CRAMPBARK, THIS HERB WAS RECOGNIZED AS A TREATMENT FOR MENSTRUAL CRAMPS IN MOST PHARMACOLOGY
REFERENCE BOOKS THROUGH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. THE BARK CONTAINS AT LEAST FOUR SUBSTANCES
THAT HELP RELAX THE UTERUS. TWO (AESCULETIN AND
SCOPOLETIN) ALSO HELP RELIEVE MUSCLE SPASMS.
WITH SO MUCH FOLKLORE AND SCIENCE TO RECOMMEND IT, BLACK HAW WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST
REMEDIES THAT I'D SUGGEST TO MY DAUGHTER IF SHE
CAME TO ME COMPLAINING OF CRAMPS.
V W CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI, CHINESE ANGELICA IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED HERBS IN
CHINESE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE. IT IS CONSIDERED A
FEMALE TONIC, ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR MENSTRUAL
CRAMPS, AND IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTS IN ORIENTAL MEDICINE.
V^^. RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). MANY WOMEN HERBALISTS I RESPECT RECOMMEND RASPBERRY LEAF TEA FOR EASING MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT THIS
HERB HELPS RELAX THE UTERUS. IT'S ALSO POPULAR FOR SOOTHING THE UTERINE IRRITABILITY
ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY.
BLACK HAW
BLACK HAW IS A SPREADING SHRUB
WITH CLUSTERS OF WHITE FLOWERS
THAT IS RELATED TO HONEYSUCKLE
AND ELDERBERRY.
326
MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
RESEARCHERS DON'T KNOW THE ACTIVE COMPOUND IN RASPBERRY, BUT THEY SPECULATE THAT IT MIGHT BE PYCNOGENOL (AN OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDIN, OR OPC). THAT
MAKES SENSE TO ME. IN ONE STUDY, TAKING 200 MILLIGRAMS OF OPC DAILY OVER TWO
CYCLES ELIMINATED OR SIGNIFICANTLY RELIEVED MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND/OR PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN 50 TO 60 PERCENT OF THE WOMEN WHO TOOK THEM. AMONG
WOMEN WHO TOOK OPCS FOR FOUR CYCLES, THE NUMBER WHO BENEFITED WAS EVEN
HIGHER—66 TO 80 PERCENT.
YOU CAN BUY PURE OPC IN THE FORM OF PYCNOGENOL, BUT IT'S AN EXPENSIVE
SUPPLEMENT. I'D SUGGEST TRYING RASPBERRY LEAF TEA INSTEAD.
W, BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTILLIIS). BILBERRY CONTAINS CHEMICALS CALLED
ANTHOCYANIDINS, WHICH HAVE MUSCLE-RELAXANT PROPERTIES, AND IT ALSO CONTAINS
OPCS. FOR MENSTRUAL CRAMPS, SOME HERBALISTS SUGGEST TAKING 20 TO 40 MILLIGRAMS
OF CONCENTRATED BILBERRY EXTRACT THREE TIMES A DAY. IF YOU CAN'T FIND EXTRACTS, TRY A
HALF-CUP OF FRESH BILBERRIES OR BLUEBERRIES, WHICH HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES.
*W CHASTEBERRY (VUEX AGNUS-CASTUS). THE SMALL FRUITS OF THE CHASTEBERRY TREE HAVE BEEN USED FOR MENSTRUAL DISORDERS SINCE GRECO-ROMAN TIMES. I'M
CONVINCED THAT CHASTEBERRY IS EFFECTIVE.
VV GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). ECLECTIC PHYSICIANS—TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY AMERICAN DOCTORS WHO COMBINED NATURAL REMEDIES WITH MAINSTREAM MEDICINE—PRESCRIBED GINGER TO TREAT PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.
THIS HERB IS ALSO USED TO INDUCE MENSTRUATION IN A WIDE RANGE OF CULTURES
FROM VENEZUELA TO VIETNAM. WITH AT LEAST SIX PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUNDS AND
ANOTHER SIX ANTI-CRAMPING COMPOUNDS, GINGER TEA IS A TRUSTWORTHY REMEDY FOR
MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.
VV KAVA KAVA (PIPER METHYSTICUM). KAVA KAVA CONTAINS TWO PAIN-RELIEVING CHEMICALS THAT ARE AS EFFE<
TIVE AS ASPIRIN, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST
(NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT
LEUNG, PH.D., AND ARKANSAS
HERBALIST STEVEN FOSTER IN THEIR BOOK
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS. ALTHOUGH KAVA
KAVA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS NARCOTIC
AND HYPNOTIC, IT IS NEITHER HALLUCINOGENIC NOR STUPEFYING. FURTHERMORE,
ACCORDING TO DR. LEUNG AND FOSTER, IT
IS NONADDICTIVE AND DOES NOT CAUSE
DEPENDENCY.
SOME EUROPEANS USE KAVA KAVA
KAVA KAVA
AN INGREDIENT IN A TRADITIONAL POLYNESIAN
BEVERAGE, KAVA KAVA HAS ANTISPASMODIC EFFECTS AND CAN HELP EASE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.
327
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
EXTRACTS FOR ITS RELAXANT OR ANTI-ANXIETY EFFECTS. SINCE THE PLANT ALSO HELPS RELAX THE
UTERUS, IT IS USED TO TREAT MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.
VV RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE). CLOVER IS RICH IN PHYTOESTROGENS,
PLANT CHEMICALS THAT ACT ON THE BODY IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FEMALE HORMONE
ESTROGEN. HERBALISTS BELIEVE THAT PHYTOESTROGENS HELP MINIMIZE MENSTRUAL
CRAMPS BY BRINGING THE BODY'S HORMONE LEVELS INTO BETTER BALANCE.
ONE PHYTOESTROGEN IN RED CLOVER IS THE COMPOUND FORMONONETIN. ALTHOUGH
"CLOVER DISEASE" HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE INFERTILITY IN SHEEP THAT GRAZE ON IT,
YOU WON'T GET ENOUGH CLOVER TO BE EVEN REMOTELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS EFFECT.
HAVE RED CLOVER IN TEA, AND IT JUST MIGHT RELIEVE CRAMPING PROBLEMS.
^ * . SQUAW VINE (MITCHELLA REPENS). CHEROKEE WOMEN ROUTINELY TOOK
SQUAW VINE FOR "PERIOD PAINS," ACCORDING TO DANIEL MOERMAN, PH.D., PROFESSOR
OF ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND AUTHOR OF SOME EXCELLENT
BOOKS ON AMERICAN INDIAN USES OF MEDICINAL PLANTS. THEY ALSO USED IT TO EASE
CHILDBIRTH AND TO TREAT SORE NIPPLES WHILE NURSING. THE OKLAHOMA, DELAWARE,
IROQUOIS AND MENOMINEE TRIBES USED SQUAW VINE SIMILARLY. TODAY'S HERBALISTS
GENERALLY RECOMMEND IT (ALONG WITH RASPBERRY) FOR THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY. YOU CAN TRY USING IT AS THE CHEROKEES DID, TO EASE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS.
V STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). LIKE RASPBERRY, STRAWBERRY LEAF MAY HELP RELIEVE CRAMPS, ACCORDING TO GERMANY'S COMMISSION E,
THE BODY OF SCIENTISTS THAT ADVISES THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS.
THE COMMISSION ALSO NOTES THAT THIS ACTION HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIATED. BUT
I MENTION STRAWBERRY BECAUSE THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD REASONS TO DRINK IT BESIDES
ITS REPUTED ABILITY TO EASE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. ITS LEAVES ARE RICH IN VITAMINS AND
MINERALS PLUS ELLAGIC ACID, A HIGHLY TOUTED CANCER PREVENTIVE. STRAWBERRY LEAF
TEA MAY BE OF BENEFIT TO ALMOST ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE DEFICIENT IN ANY VITAMINS
OR MINERALS. ONE PIECE OF ADVICE, THOUGH: DON'T DRINK STRAWBERRY LEAF TEA IF
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO STRAWBERRIES.
V YARROW {ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM). YARROW IS USEFUL FOR RELIEVING
WOMEN'S PAINFUL CRAMPS, ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E. I AM NOT SURPRISED AT THIS
ENDORSEMENT, AS YARROW CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ANTISPASMODIC CONSTITUENTS.
MORNING SICKNESS
A
WHILE BACK, ONE OF MY NIECES TELEPHONED TO ASK WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR MORNING SICKNESS. SHE WAS PREGNANT AND HAVING TROUBLE
328
MORNIN G SICKNES S
KEEPING ANYTHING DOWN. I WAS FACED WITH MY USUAL PROBLEM: I'M A BOTANIST, NOT
A CLINICIAN. SUPPOSE I'M WRONG? I WOULD NEVER WANT TO SUGGEST TO MY NIECE THAT
SHE TRY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE DANGEROUS TO HER OR HER BABY.
I'D ONCE TOLD MY DAUGHTER TO TRY GINGER FOR MORNING SICKNESS, AND NOW I
WAS PREPARED TO RECOMMEND THE SAME FOR MY NIECE. MY ONLY HESITATION WAS THE
COUNSEL OF ONE PHARMACOLOGIST, WHO SAID THAT GINGER MIGHT STIMULATE MISCARRIAGE. BUT I COULDN'T IMAGINE A CUP OR TWO OF GINGER TEA DOING THIS, SO WITH THE
ONE CAUTION I HAD ALSO GIVEN MY DAUGHTER—TO GO SLOWLY—I SUGGESTED THE HERB
TO MY NIECE. SHE PHONED BACK TO SAY THAT THE GINGER HELPED, WITH NO NOTICEABLE
SIDE EFFECTS.
PLL STILL COUNSEL GINGER UNTIL I GET MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE PHARMACOLOGIST'S
WARNING HAS MERIT. MEANWHILE, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SAFER OR BETTER FOR
MORNING SICKNESS.
SHORTLY AFTER I TALKED WITH MY NIECE, I LEARNED OF A STUDY THAT PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE PHARMACOLOGIST'S CONCERN ABOUT MISCARRIAGE. IT TURNS OUT THAT IT TAKES
LESS THAN 1 GRAM OF GINGER TO CONTROL THE NAUSEA OF MORNING SICKNESS, WHILE THE
CHINESE, WHO USE THE HERB TO BRING ON MENSTRUATION (AND POSSIBLY ABORTION)
USE 20 TO 28 GRAMS FOR THIS PURPOSE.
VERY ROUGHLY, A STRONG CUP OF GINGER TEA MIGHT CONTAIN ABOUT 250 MILLIGRAMS OF THE HERB, WHICH IS ABOUT HO OF THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO TRIGGER MISCARRIAGE. A HEAVILY SPICED CHINESE DISH MIGHT CONTAIN 500 MILLIGRAMS—LAO OF

KIND OF PROBLEMS.
QUEASY TIMES
MORNING SICKNESS IS THE NAUSEA, DIZZINESS AND GENERAL ILL FEELING THAT
PREGNANT WOMEN EXPERIENCE ON GETTING UP IN THE MORNING, OR SOMETIMES FOR
MUCH OF THE DAY. AN ESTIMATED 50 PERCENT OF PREGNANT WOMEN COMPLAIN OF
MORNING SICKNESS, TYPICALLY DURING THEIR FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY. BUT SOME
WOMEN EXPERIENCE IT FOR MUCH LONGER.
SCIENTISTS ARE NOT SURE WHY MORNING SICKNESS DEVELOPS. SEVERAL FOLK MEDICAL TRADITIONS CLAIM IT'S NATURE'S WAY OF CLEARING TOXINS FROM THE MOTHER'S
SYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I DO KNOW I'D NEVER SUGGEST THAT MY
DAUGHTER OR ANY WOMAN TAKE HARD-CORE MEDICATIONS TO TREAT IT. SO I HOPE THAT
IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, YOU'LL DISCUSS THESE GENTLE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES WITH YOUR
DOCTOR BEFORE RESORTING TO DRUGS TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEM.

GREEN PHARMACY FOR MORNING SICKNESS
IF YOU BELIEVE IN FOOD AS YOUR BEST MEDICINE, AS I DO, THEN JUST EATING MIGHT
HELP. MANY PREGNANT WOMEN REPORT RELIEF FROM MORNING SICKNESS WHEN THEY
SNACK ON DRY TOAST OR CRACKERS IMMEDIATELY AFTER RISING AND EAT SMALL, FREQUENT
MEALS DURING THE DAY. IN ADDITION, HERE ARE THE HERBS THAT CAN HELP.
V V* GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). IN A PAPER I ONCE PUBLISHED CALLED
"FOODS AS PHARMACEUTICALS," I LISTED ONLY GINGER FOR MORNING SICKNESS. MANY
WOMEN HAVE TOLD ME SINCE THAT IT HELPS, AND I BELIEVE THEM.
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY SCIENTIFIC STUDIES SHOWING THAT GINGER HELPS RELIEVE
MORNING SICKNESS, BUT THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT THE
HERB TREATS MOTION SICKNESS, A CLOSELY RELATED STOMACH-UPSETTING CONDITION. ONE
EXCELLENT STUDY SHOWED GINGER TO BE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE COMMONLY PRESCRIBED
DIMENHYDRINATE (DRAMAMINE) AS A TREATMENT FOR NAUSEA INDUCED BY MOTION.
IN SEVERAL STUDIES, GINGER HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEVE DIZZINESS. THIS
CHAPTER LISTS OTHER REMEDIES FOR MORNING SICKNESS, BUT IN MY OPINION, GINGER
STILL RANKS NUMBER ONE. I'D SUGGEST UP TO TWO CUPS OF GINGER TEA A DAY.
VV PEPPERMIN T (MENTHA PIPERITA) AND OTHE R MINTS. PEPPERMINT
OWES ITS MEDICINAL VALUE TO MENTHOL, A COOLING, ANESTHETIC STOMACH SOOTHER.
THE ECLECTICS, NINETEENTH-CENTURY PHYSICIANS WHO COMBINED HERBS WITH THE
MAINSTREAM MEDICINE OF THE TIME, RECOMMENDED MENTHOL VAPORS FOR MORNING
SICKNESS. THE ANCIENT ROMANS CHEWED MINT SPRIGS TO SOOTHE THEIR STOMACHS
AFTER LARGE MEALS, HENCE OUR AFTER-DINNER MINTS (WHICH DON'T CONTAIN REAL PEPPERMINT, DESPITE THEIR NAME).
PEPPERMINT CERTAINLY WORKS TO RELIEVE STOMACH DISTRESS, BUT ACCORDING TO
MY DATABASE, IT IS NOT THE BEST SOURCE OF MENTHOL. CORNMINT TOPS THE MENTHOL
LIST, FOLLOWED BY MOUNTAIN MINT (WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT USE DURING PREGNANCY),
WATERMINT AND VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN MINT.
JUST DON'T DRINK LARGE AMOUNTS OF STRONG PEPPERMINT TEA, AS SOME HERBALS
WARN THAT LARGE AMOUNTS MAY TRIGGER MISCARRIAGE. IF MY NIECE WANTED TO USE
PEPPERMINT TEA, I'D SUGGEST SHE DRINK NO MORE THAN A CUP OR TWO AT A TIME.
V BLACK HOREHOUND (BALLOTA NIGRA). THIS HERB HAS A GOOD REPUTATION
AS A TREATMENT FOR THE NAUSEA OF MOTION SICKNESS. I BELIEVE IT'S ALSO USEFUL AS A
TREATMENT FOR VOMITING DUE TO PREGNANCY OR NERVOUSNESS.
TRY BLACK HOREHOUND ALONE OR IN THIS COMBINATION: ONE PART BLACK HOREHOUND, ONE PART CAMOMILE AND TWO PARTS MEADOWSWEET. MEADOWSWEET CONTAINS
AN ASPIRIN-LIKE COMPOUND, SO IF A LITTLE ASPIRIN UPSETS YOUR STOMACH, YOU MIGHT
REPLACE THIS HERB WITH GINGER AND/OR CITRUS RIND. TRY A CUP OR TWO A DAY.
V CABBAGE (BRASSICA OLERACEA). RAW OR COOKED CABBAGE, CABBAGE
330
MOTION SICKNESS
JUICE AND/OR SAUERKRAUT ARE OLD-TIME REMEDIES FOR STOMACH DISTRESS. SAUERKRAUT
JUICE IN PARTICULAR IS REPORTEDLY SOOTHING TO THE OVERACTIVE INTESTINES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MORNING SICKNESS.
V PEACH (PRIMUS PERSICA). THE CHINESE USE THE LEAVES AND EUROPEANS
USE THE BARK OF THE PEACH TREE TO MAKE A TEA FOR MORNING SICKNESS. THE LEAVES
CONTAIN THE COMPOUND BENZALDEHYDE, WHICH SHOULD BE OF SOME HELP IN RELIEVING THIS CONDITION. IF YOU OPT FOR BARK, DON'T USE MORE THAN A TEASPOON.
V RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). TEA MADE FROM RASPBERRY LEAVES HAS
BEEN WIDELY RECOMMENDED FOR CURBING THE NAUSEA OF MORNING SICKNESS. THIS
USE HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED ADEQUATELY ENOUGH. STILL, I BELIEVE THAT FOLKLORE
CARRIES A GOOD DEAL OF WEIGHT, AND THE TEA HAS A PERSISTENT REPUTATION AS A TREATMENT FOR WOMEN'S CONDITIONS, FROM MENSTRUAL CRAMPS TO MORNING SICKNESS AND
LABOR PAINS.
RASPBERRY LEAF IS SAID TO CONTAIN A CONSTITUENT, READILY EXTRACTED WITH HOT
WATER, THAT RELAXES THE SMOOTH MUSCLES OF THE UTERUS. I'D SUGGEST DRINKING UP
TO THREE CUPS A DAY. OR COMBINE IT WITH GINGER, MINT AND A LITTLE LEMON FOR A
VERY PLEASANT ANTI-QUEASINESS TEA.
V CITRUS FRUITS. A LITTLE PIECE OF GRAPEFRUIT, ORANGE OR TANGERINE RIND
ADDED TO BEVERAGE TEAS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO HELP RELIEVE MORNING SICKNESS.
V JUICES. THOSE WHO HAVE JUICING MACHINES MIGHT CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF GINGER, KIWI, MINT AND PINEAPPLE; APPLE, CARROT AND GINGER; OR APPLE,
FENNEL, GINGER AND PEPPERMINT OR SPEARMINT. THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF
THESE HERBS LEAD ME TO SUSPECT THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE USEFUL IN EASING MORNING
SICKNESS. AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO BANISH THIS PROBLEM THAN WITH A HEALTHY, TASTY
JUICE FOR BREAKFAST?
MOTION SICKNESS
O
UR WORD NAUSEA COMES FROM THE GREEK WORD NANS, MEANING "SHIP."
NAUS IS ALSO THE ROOT OF OUR WORD NAUTICAL. WHAT DOES NAUSEA HAVE TO
DO WITH NAUTICAL? IF YOU'VE EVER HAD SEASICKNESS, YOU KNOW. THOSE OLD GREEK
SAILORS BATTLED SEASICKNESS AS WELL AS ACTUAL STORMS AT SEA AND MYTHICAL SEA
MONSTERS.
SEASICKNESS IS JUST ONE FORM OF MOTION SICKNESS, THE NAUSEA, DIZZINESS AND
I'D-RATHER-BE-DEAD FEELING THAT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ON BOATS, CARS, TRAINS
OR PLANES.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
DRUGSTORES STOCK SEVERAL DIFFERENT MOTION SICKNESS REMEDIES, MOST NOTABLY
THE ANTIHISTAMINE DIMENHYDRINATE (DRAMAMINE). TRANSDERM SCOP, A PATCH THAT
DELIVERS THE DRUG SCOPOLAMINE THROUGH THE SKIN, IS A POPULAR TREATMENT, BUT IT
CAN CAUSE SIDE EFFECTS THAT PROMPT CONCERNS ABOUT ITS SAFETY. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO CAUSE HALLUCINATIONS AND CONVULSIONS IN SOME PEOPLE. AND DIMENHYDRINATE
CAN ALSO CAUSE PROBLEMS, MAKING YOU DROWSY AND DOPEY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR MOTION SICKNESS
FORTUNATELY, THERE'S ONE HERBAL ALTERNATIVE THAT BEATS MOTION SICKNESS
DRUGS EVERY TIME. I'M TALKING ABOUT GINGER. IT'S NOT THE ONLY EFFECTIVE HERBAL
REMEDY, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY THE BEST THAT I'M AWARE OF.
V \ V GINGER {ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). SOME YEARS AGO OUT IN UTAH, HERBAL
PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF
HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES, TESTED GINGER HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST DIMENHYDRINATE. HE RIGGED UP A MOTORIZED CHAIR GUARANTEED TO CAUSE
NAUSEA IN ANYONE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MOTION SICKNESS. THE CHAIR HAD A HANDLE, ALLOWING THOSE SEATED IN IT TO TURN IT OFF AT WILL.
DR. MOWREY RECRUITED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO GOT MOTION SICKNESS. HE
GAVE HALF OF THEM A STANDARD DOSE OF DIMENHYDRINATE; THE OTHER HALF GOT ONE
GRAM (ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON) OF GINGER. THEY ALL RODE THE CHAIR AND TURNED IT
OFF WHEN THEY STARTED FEELING NAUSEATED. THOSE TAKING THE GINGER LASTED ALMOST
TWICE AS LONG AS THOSE IN THE DIMENHYDRINATE GROUP.
NOT LONG AFTER DR. MOWREY'S STUDY, OTHER RESEARCHERS RECRUITED 80 NAVAL
CADETS WHO WERE PRONE TO SEASICKNESS AND GAVE EACH OF THEM ONE GRAM OF
POWDERED GINGER. THE RESEARCHERS REPORTED 38 PERCENT LESS SEASICKNESS AND
72 PERCENT LESS VOMITING AMONG THOSE CADETS. EVER SINCE THOSE STUDIES, EVERY
HERBALIST I KNOW HAS TRUMPETED GINGER FOR MOTION SICKNESS.
VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, ENDORSES GINGER: 'TO PREVENT MOTION SICKNESS, SWALLOW TWO CAPSULES 30 MINUTES
BEFORE DEPARTURE AND THEN ONE OR TWO MORE AS SYMPTOMS BEGIN TO OCCUR, PROBABLY ABOUT EVERY FOUR HOURS."
I USE GINGER MYSELF. IT WORKS. SOMETIMES I MUNCH THE GINGER RAW, BUT
CHANCES ARE THAT YOU'D PREFER A FEW TEASPOONS IN TEA. YOU CAN ALSO BUY GINGER
CAPSULES AT HEALTH FOOD STORES. OR YOU CAN SIMPLY DRINK GINGER ALE, BUT IF YOU
DO, MAKE SURE THE LABEL SAYS THAT IT'S MADE WITH REAL GINGER. A LOT OF GINGER ALE
THESE DAYS IS ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED.
YET ANOTHER GINGER-FILLED REMEDY IS MY STOMACH-SETTLER TEA: CHOP UP A
TWO-INCH SECTION OF GINGER ROOT AND STIR IT IN WITH DASHES OF CAMOMILE FLOWERS,
332
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
FENNEL, ORANGE PEEL, PEPPERMINT AND/OR SPEARMINT. STEEP THESE WITH A FEW
CUPS OF WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. (YOU MIGHT ALSO ADD A DASH OF CINNAMON. BACK
IN KING SOLOMON'S TIME, CINNAMON TEA WAS USED TO PREVENT NAUSEA. QUEEN
PEGGY, MRS. DUKE, STILL USES IT THIS WAY.)
IF YOU HAVE A JUICER ON HAND, YOU MIGHT TRY JUICEMAN JAY KORDICH'S GINGER
JOLT—TWO APPLES, ONE PEAR AND A ONE-INCH SECTION OF GINGER ROOT. IF ALL YOU
HAVE IS A BLENDER, TRY THIS DIGESTIVE DELIGHT FROM NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY,
N.D.: ONE CUP OF FRESH PINEAPPLE CHUNKS, ONE OR TWO KIWIFRUITS, A ONE-INCH
SECTION OF GINGER ROOT AND A FEW PINCHES OF MINT.
V RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). RASPBERRY LEAF TEA IS WIDELY RECOMMENDED FOR THE NAUSEA OF MORNING SICKNESS. SOME HERBALISTS ALSO SUGGEST IT
FOR MOTION SICKNESS. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT: GINGER AND RASPBERRY TEA
MIX NICELY.
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
MY BEST FRIEND FROM COLLEGE, NOW A DENTIST AND JAZZ SAXOPHONIST WHO
PLAYS WITH A GROUP IMAGINATIVELY NAMED GROUP SAX, WAS HIT WITH
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AROUND AGE 55. HE ASKED MY ADVICE ABOUT THIS MYSTERIOUS AND ELUSIVE DISEASE. I TOLD HIM WHAT I KNEW AND ABOUT NATURAL HEALING
TECHNIQUES THAT MIGHT BE PROMISING—SOME HERBAL OILS AND A FEW DIETARY APPROACHES.
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. APPARENTLY MY ADVICE HELPED. LIKE MOST MS
PATIENTS, HE HAS UPS AND DOWNS, BUT WHEN I LAST TALKED WITH HIM, HE HAD A NEW
GIRLFRIEND AND WAS PLANNING TO ATTEND THE REUNION OF OUR SATTERFIELD BIG BAND
JAZZ ORCHESTRA. HE AND I BOTH PLAYED WITH SATTERFIELD DURING COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL. FOR NEARLY 15 YEARS NOW, WE'VE BEEN
HAVING REUNIONS IN CHAPEL HILL EACH AUGUST, PLAYING BIG BAND NUMBERS FOR ONE
FUN WEEKEND A YEAR. DESPITE MY FRIEND'S MS, HE'S OUTLIVED QUITE A FEW OTHER
SATTERFIELDERS.
TKE YOUNGF PEOPLE'S DISEASE
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IS A BAFFLING, HEARTBREAKING CHRONIC ILLNESS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED 350,000 AMERICANS, ABOUT 60 PERCENT
333
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
OF THEM WOMEN. TWO-THIRDS OF MS CASES ARE DIAGNOSED IN PEOPLE AGES 20 TO 40.
IN MS, THE PROTECTIVE MYELIN SHEATH THAT COVERS THE MAJOR NERVES BREAKS
DOWN, CAUSING MINUTE ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTIONS WITHIN THE NERVES. PEOPLE WITH
MS MAY EXPERIENCE AN ENORMOUS ARRAY OF POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS, FROM MINOR
WEAKNESS TO PARALYSIS. IN MOST, HOWEVER, THE SYMPTOMS COME AND GO. AFTER
EACH ATTACK, OR EXACERBATION, SOME PEOPLE RETURN TO NORMAL, WHILE OTHERS EXPERIENCE RESIDUAL DISABILITY.
SCIENTISTS ARE NOT SURE WHAT CAUSES MS, BUT THERE ARE TWO MAJOR THEORIES:
MS OFTEN APPEARS IN CLUSTERS, LEADING SOME EXPERTS TO THEORIZE THAT A VIRUS OR
VIRUSLIKE MICROORGANISM IS THE CULPRIT. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT MS IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. IN THIS VIEW, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM MISTAKES THE MYELIN SHEATH
FOR A THREATENING INVADER AND ATTACKS IT.
A THIRD THEORY HAS ALSO BEEN PROPOSED, BUT IT HAS RECEIVED SCANT ATTENTION
FROM CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. IT LINKS MS TO A HIGH-FAT DIET. ITS ORIGINATOR, ROY
L. SWANK, M.D., PH.D., PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF NEUROLOGY AT OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY IN PORTLAND AND AUTHOR OF THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DIET BOOK,
CLAIMS IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN TREATING MS WITH A LOW-FAT ELIMINATION DIET.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
MOST DIETARY APPROACHES TO MS STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DECREASING THE
AMOUNT OF SATURATED FAT IN THE DIET—THE KIND OF FAT FOUND IN MEAT AND DAIRY
PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, I'D ALSO SUGGEST SOME HERBS.
V*V STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). PD CERTAINLY FLAIL MYSELF WITH NETTLE IF I
HAD MS. THIS PRACTICE, KNOWN AS URTICATION, INVOLVES TAKING THE FRESH PLANT, WHICH IS
COVERED WITH TINY, HAIRLIKE STINGERS, AND SIMPLY SLAPPING IT AGAINST YOUR EXPOSED
SKIN. (REMEMBER, YOU NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHENEVER YOU HANDLE THIS PLANT.) IT STINGS
AND IS IRRITATING AS ALL GET-OUT, BUT IT DOES PROVIDE MICROINJECTIONS OF A NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL CHEMICALS.
AMONG THESE COMPOUNDS IS HISTAMINE, THE CHEMICAL THAT OFTEN INDUCES ALLERGIES LIKE HAY FEVER. SEVERAL COMPOUNDS IN STINGING NETDE MIGHT HAVE EFFECTS
SIMILAR TO BEE STINGS. I KNOW IT SOUNDS FAR-FETCHED, BUT SOME PEOPLE WITH MS
HAVE BENEFITED FROM BEING STUNG BY BEES, A FORM OF THERAPY THAT IS OCCASIONALLY
RECOMMENDED BY PROPONENTS OF ALTERNATIVE HEALING METHODS FOR PEOPLE WITH
THIS CONDITION.
I PERSONALLY THINK PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF USING A POTTED STINGING NETTLE PLANT
RATHER THAN BEES. UNLIKE THE BEES, WHICH DIE AFTER STINGING YOU, THE PLANT
RECHARGES ITS MICROINJECTOR NEEDLES AND CAN BE USED AGAIN AND AGAIN. I DON'T
CONSIDER NETTLE CURATIVE, BUT I BELIEVE IT WOULD HELP, AND AS I MENTIONED, I HAVE
HEARD TESTIMONY TO THIS EFFECT.
334
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
DR. SWANK'S LOW-FAT MET
IN THE LATE 1940S, ROY L. SWANK, M.D., PH.D., PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF NEUROLOGY AT
OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY IN PORTLAND AND AUTHOR OF THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS
DIET BOOK, WHO IS NOW ALMOST 90, FIRST BECAME INTERESTED IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS).
AT THAT TIME, SCIENTISTS WERE PUZZLED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT THE DISEASE BECOMES
MORE PREVALENT AS ONE MOVES AWAY FROM THE EQUATOR. RATES IN THE UNITED STATES,
CANADA, ENGLAND, SCANDINAVIA, GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND WERE HIGHER THAN RATES IN
MEXICO AND SOUTHERN EUROPE.
A HALF-CENTURY AGO, MS STATISTICS WERE SKETCHY IN MOST COUNTRIES EXCEPT
NORWAY, WHICH HAD INSTITUTED ONE OF THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE DISEASE-REPORTING
SYSTEMS. DR. SWANK LOOKED AT MS THERE, EXPECTING TO FIND MORE CASES IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY THAN IN THE SOUTH. INSTEAD HE FOUND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PATTERN. THE MS RATE WAS LOW ALONG THE ENTIRE NORTH-SOUTH NORWEGIAN COAST,
BUT CONSIDERABLY HIGHER INLAND. WHAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE?
USING NORWEGIAN DIET SURVEYS, DR. SWANK DETERMINED THAT THE FARM-BASED
INLAND POPULATION ATE A DIET THAT WAS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IN SATURATED FAT (MEATS
AND DAIRY PRODUCTS) THAN THE FISHING-BASED COASTAL POPULATION. INTRIGUED, HE REINTERPRETED THE STRANGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF MS: ALL OF THE NORTHERN COUNTRIES
WITH HIGH MS RATES ALSO CONSUMED MORE SATURATED FATS THAN THE SOUTHERN COUNTRIES WITH LOW MS RATES.
TO TEST HIS THEORY, BEGINNING IN 1950—DECADES BEFORE DIETARY FAT WAS LINKED
TO CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND OTHER ILLS—DR. SWANK RECRUITED 150 PEOPLE WITH MS,
PLACED THEM ON A DIET LOW IN SATURATED FATS AND COMPARED THE COURSE OF THEIR DISEASE TO THAT OF A SIMILAR GROUP WHO ATE AN UNRESTRICTED DIET. AFTER 20 YEARS, THOSE
ON THE SWANK DIET EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIALLY FEWER MS FLARE-UPS, FEWER DEATHS AND
LESS DISABILITY. (THEIR BLOOD CHOLESTEROL LEVELS ALSO FELL TO AN AVERAGE OF LESS THAN
150, SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THEIR RISK OF HEART DISEASE.) THE DETAILS OF DR. SWANK'S
DIET ARE AVAILABLE IN HIS BOOK.
THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF THE NEUROLOGICAL DETERIORATION OF MS SUBSTANTIALLY
SLOWING, AND SOMETIMES STOPPING, ON THE SWANK DIET, BUT IT REMAINS VERY CONTROVERSIAL. THE MS ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ENDORSE IT.
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY WORTH TRYING. EVEN IF THE SWANK DIET DOESN'T HELP YOUR
MS, IT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP PREVENT CANCER AND HEART DISEASE BECAUSE IT IS LOW IN
FAT AND HIGH IN FIBER.
L I
THERE ARE NO REPORTS IN THE UNITED STATES OF SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO
STINGING NETTLE, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERE REACTIONS TO BEE STINGS, INCLUDING
SOME FATALITIES.

BLACK CURRANT
BLACK CURRANT SEEDS CONTAIN THE SAME
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY SUBSTANCE THAT'S
FOUND IN EVENING PRIMROSE OIL.

THOUGHT TO BE USEFUL IN TREATING MS. HERB
/^¾ ^ W ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE

MILLIGRAMS OF BLACK CURRANT OIL TWICE A
DAY AND SAYS IMPROVEMENT CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER EIGHT WEEKS.
GLA CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN BORAGE
AND EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO), BUT
BLACK CURRANT OIL MAY BE CHEAPER. (I'M
PARTIAL TO EPO MYSELF.)
V * BLUEBERRY (VACCINIUMY VARIOUS SPECIES). THESE BERRIES CONTAIN
COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS). THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF OPCS
IS COMPLICATED, BUT THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THEY HELP PREVENT THE
BREAKDOWN OF CERTAIN TISSUES, SUCH AS THE MYELIN SHEATHS THAT SURROUND THE NERVE
FIBERS. OPCS ALSO HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY THAT MIGHT HELP RELIEVE MS
SYMPTOMS. THIS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD REASON TO EAT MORE BLUEBERRIES.
^ V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). LIKE BLACK CURRANT OIL,
EPO IS RICH IN GLA. BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL
HANDBOOK, SAYS THAT EPO IS "RECOMMENDED IN ALL CASES" OF MS.
VV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). PINEAPPLE CONTAINS ENZYMES, PANCREATIN AND BROMELAIN, THAT BREAK UP PROTEIN MOLECULES. BESIDES BEING ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, THESE ENZYMES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HELP REDUCE THE LEVEL OF CIRCULATING
IMMUNE COMPLEXES (CICS). HIGH LEVELS OF CICS OCCUR IN A NUMBER OF AUTOIMMUNE
DISEASES, INCLUDING MS. THESE IMMUNE COMPLEXES ACTIVATE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
TO ATTACK THE BODY, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO TISSUE DAMAGE.
W PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING
MAGNESIUM. IN A LETTER TO THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL LANCET SOME YEARS AGO, A
BRITISH BIOCHEMIST WITH MS SAID THAT SUPPLEMENTAL MAGNESIUM BY ITSELF WORKED
BETTER FOR HIM THAN ALL OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL VITAMINS AND MINERALS. HE TOOK 375
MILLIGRAMS A DAY. (THE DAILY VALUE IS 400 MILLIGRAMS.) THIS IS JUST ONE MAN'S
STORY—AN ANECDOTE—EVEN THOUGH IT COMES FROM A BIOCHEMIST AND WAS PRINTED IN
A RESPECTED JOURNAL. STILL, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, IT MEANS THAT PURSLANE AND OTHER
336
NAUSEA
SOURCES OF MAGNESIUM ARE WORTH TRYING. I KNOW I WOULD TRY THEM IF I HAD MS.
IF YOU'D LIKE YOUR MAGNESIUM FROM AN HERBAL SOURCE, PURSLANE IS THE HERB
RICHEST IN THIS MINERAL, AT NEARLY 2 PERCENT ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS, FOLLOWED BY
POPPY SEEDS, COWPEAS AND SPINACH. I STEAM PURSLANE LIKE SPINACH AND EAT IT
RAW IN SALADS. A HEAPING SERVING OF STEAMED GREENS COULD PROVIDE AS MUCH
MAGNESIUM AS THE BIOCHEMIST TOOK. SO WOULD EIGHT OUNCES OF FRESH GREENS.
NAUSEA
O
NE DAY A CO-WORKER, WHO WAS ALSO A FRIEND AND A REGISTERED NURSE, TOLD
ME THAT A FRIEND OF HERS WAS EXPERIENCING A LOT OF NAUSEA. SHE CASUALLY ASKED ME WHAT I'D RECOMMEND FOR RELIEF. I IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTED GINGER.
SIX MONTHS LATER, SHE MENTIONED IN PASSING THAT THE GINGER HAD WORKED.
ONLY LATER DID I REALIZE THAT SHE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP FOR A FRIEND. SHE HERSELF
HAD BEEN ON CHEMOTHERAPY TO TREAT CANCER, AND BASED ON MY RECOMMENDATION,
SHE HAD USED GINGER TO RELIEVE THE NAUSEA IT OFTEN CAUSES. GINGER'S ABILITY TO
TREAT NAUSEA IS THAT IMPRESSIVE.
THIS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE I SAW THE PUBLISHED STUDIES
SHOWING THAT GINGER IS HELPFUL IN RELIEVING CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA.
(CHEMOTHERAPY PATIENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE GINGER IF THEIR BLOOD-CLOTTING ABILITY IS
IMPAIRED, HOWEVER.)
NAUSEA, AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, IS THAT HORRIBLE ABDOMINAL SENSATION THAT
MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOMIT. AND VOMITING MEANS LOSING YOUR
LUNCH, PLUS A GOOD DEAL OF STOMACH ACID AS WELL, WHICH IS WHY IT CAUSES A
BURNING SENSATION IN THE CHEST AND THROAT.
NAUSEA AND VOMITING CAN BE CAUSED BY MANY THINGS: INFECTIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT (GASTROENTERITIS), INNER EAR DISORDERS OVERINDULGENCE IN ALCOHOL
OR FOODS, INTESTINAL PARASITES, MORNING SICKNESS IN PREGNANCY, MOTION SICKNESS,
EMOTIONAL STRESS AND TOXIC OVERLOADS ON THE LIVER.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR NAUSEA
FREQUENTLY, ONE GOOD UPCHUCK IS ALL IT TAKES TO RELIEVE NAUSEA. YOU JUST
VOMIT AND GET IT OVER WITH. BUT IN OTHER CASES, NAUSEA PERSISTS EVEN AFTER THE
STOMACH HAS EMPTIED, AND YOU TRY TO VOMIT WITHOUT RESULT, A CONDITION KNOWN AS
DRY HEAVES. THAT'S WHEN THE HERBAL REMEDIES IN THIS CHAPTER MIGHT HELP.
337
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
V W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT GINGER APPEARS
TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG METOCLOPRAMIDE (REGLAN, CLOPRA) IN REDUCING THE NAUSEA AND VOMITING CAUSED BY CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS IS ONE USE
FOR GINGER THAT YOU SHOULD DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR. IF HE SAYS THAT YOUR BLOOD-CLOTTING ABILITY IS IMPAIRED, YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS HERB WHILE UNDERGOING
CHEMOTHERAPY.
OF COURSE, GINGER HELPS WITH NAUSEA FROM LESS EXTREME CAUSES AS WELL. I
DISCUSS ITS ANTI-NAUSEA BENEFITS AT SOME LENGTH IN THE CHAPTERS ON MORNING
SICKNESS AND MOTION SICKNESS, BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT FOR NAUSEA AND VOMITING, GINGER IS MANY GOOD HERBALISTS' HERB OF CHOICE.
POWDERED GINGER MAKES A PLEASANT-TASTING TEA, BUT WHEN YOU'RE EXPERIENCING NAUSEA, NOTHING SEEMS TO DO THE TRICK QUITE AS WELL AS GINGER ALE. JUST
CHECK THE LABEL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS MADE WITH REAL GINGER; MANY GINGER ALES
ARE ARTIFICIALLY FLAVORED.
V CINNAMON (CINNAMOMUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). MY WIFE TAKES CINNAMON TEA WHEN SHE FEELS NAUSEATED. IT HELPS, AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. CINNAMON
CONTAINS CHEMICALS CALLED CATECHINS, WHICH HELP RELIEVE NAUSEA.
CATECHINS ALSO OCCUR IN AGRIMONY, BARLEY, BILBERRIES, CHINABERRIES, DOG ROSE, ENGLISH OAK, HOPS,
HAWTHORN, MOTHERWORT, NORTHERN RED OAK, OLIVES,
PEARS, PECANS, SAGE, STRAWBERRIES, TEA AND WHITE
WILLOW.
V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). PEPPERMINT TEA IS A POWERFUL ANTISPASMODIC, MEANING THAT IT STOPS
MUSCLE SPASMS IN THE DIGESTIVE TRACT,
INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN VOMITING.
(BUT I WOULDN'T DRINK MUCH OF IT IF
YOU'RE PREGNANT, SINCE SOME HERBALISTS
HAVE NOTED THAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF PEPPERMINT TEA MAY LEAD TO MISCARRIAGE.)
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS.
AROMATHERAPY CAN ALSO HELP RELIEVE
NAUSEA AND VOMITING. ESSENTIAL OILS OF
PEPPERMINT AND ROSEWOOD HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTED FOR TREATING NAUSEA. OILS OF
BLACK PEPPER, CAMOMILE, CAMPHOR,
FENNEL, LAVENDER, PEPPERMINT AND ROSE ARE RECOMMENDED FOR RELIEVING VOMITING.
PLACE A DROP OR TWO OF THE ESSENTIAL OIL OR OILS THAT YOU'RE TRYING IN A TABLESPOON OF VEGETABLE OIL AND MASSAGE THE MIXTURE INTO YOUR CHEST SO THE AROMA

CAN BE INHALED EASILY. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT ESSENTIAL OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL
USE ONLY.
V CARMINATIVE HERBS. CARMINATIVE MEANS "STOMACH-SOOTHING." CARMINATIVES ARE USED MOSTLY TO TREAT INDIGESTION AND INFANT COLIC, BUT MANY RESPECTED HERBALISTS ALSO RECOMMEND THEM FOR NAUSEA.
THE CARMINATIVE HERBS I LIKE BEST INCLUDE CAMOMILE, DILL, FENNEL, LEMON
BALM AND ANY OF THE MINTS. I'D SUGGEST TRYING A TEA MADE WITH A FEW TEASPOONS
OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE.
OSTEOPOROSIS
O
STEOPOROSIS, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, IS A DISEASE CAUSED BY LOSS OF THE
MINERAL CALCIUM AND INVOLVES A WEAKENING OF BONE. IT IS ONE OF THE
MOST COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING, AND IT AFFECTS MANY MORE
WOMEN THAN MEN. ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF WOMEN OVER 65 SHOW SIGNS OF OSTEOPOROSIS, WHILE THE FIGURE FOR ELDERLY MEN IS LESS THAN 10 PERCENT. THIN, PETITE
WOMEN ARE AT GREATEST RISK. (MY WIFE, PEGGY, WHO IS UNDER 65 AND FORMERLY THIN,
HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH OSTEOPOROSIS.)
OSTEOPOROSIS CAUSES A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS: LOWER BACK PAIN, LOSS
OF HEIGHT (UP TO SEVERAL INCHES), STOOPED POSTURE (DOWAGER'S HUMP) AND INCREASED RISK OF FRACTURES, PARTICULARLY OF THE HIP. CURRENTLY, MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOPOROSIS COSTS THE UNITED STATES SOME $6 BILLION A YEAR.
UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND MOST PHYSICIANS TOLD US THAT SUPPLEMENTS, INCLUDING CALCIUM, WERE A WASTE OF TIME AND
MONEY. NOW, VERY BELATEDLY, THEY TELL US THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH CALCIUM.
ACCORDING TO THE 1995 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) CONSENSUS DEVELOPMENT PANEL ON OPTIMAL CALCIUM INTAKE, AMERICANS (ESPECIALLY WOMEN)
SHOULD GET 1,000 TO 1,500 MILLIGRAMS A DAY. UNFORTUNATELY, MOST GET MUCH LESS
THAN THAT, AND MANY DON'T GET EVEN HALF THAT AMOUNT.
GETTING TKE FULL SPECTRUM OF NUTRIENTS
IRONICALLY, THE VERY DOCTORS AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS ON THE NIH PANEL WHO
WOULD HAVE SAID "FOOD OVER SUPPLEMENTS" A FEW YEARS AGO NOW SEEM TO BE
SAYING "SUPPLEMENTS OVER FOOD" WHEN IT COMES TO CALCIUM.
339
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THE PANEL DID SAY THAT, IDEALLY, PEOPLE SHOULD GET THEIR CALCIUM FROM FOODS
SUCH AS LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS, BROCCOLI, TOFU, KALE, LEGUMES, CANNED FISH, NUTS
AND SEEDS. BUT THE PANEL'S REPORT ALSO IMPLIED THAT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST
IMPRACTICAL FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS. THE REPORT SPENT A GOOD DEAL
OF SPACE TELLING PEOPLE HOW TO TAKE CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS—BETWEEN MEALS, TO
MINIMIZE INTERFERENCE WITH IRON ABSORPTION.
I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS, BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
EVERYONE SHOULD GET AS MUCH CALCIUM AS POSSIBLE FROM FOODS. IT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE TO DO THIS, IT'S ALSO BETTER FOR YOUR BONES, BECAUSE THE MINERAL STRENGTH OF
BONE DEPENDS ON MORE THAN CALCIUM. FOR CALCIUM TO ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN BONE,
IT MUST BE CONSUMED ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER NUTRIENTS THAT FEW EXPERTS SEEM
TO TALK ABOUT. PHOSPHORUS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT, BUT YOU ALSO NEED MAGNESIUM, BORON, ZINC, VITAMIN D AND VITAMIN A. YOU CAN GET ALL OF THESE NUTRIENTS
FROM SUPPLEMENTS, BUT I PREFER TO GET THEM THE WAY NATURE INTENDED—PACKAGED ALL TOGETHER IN FOOD.
THE OTHER NEWS ABOUT OSTEOPOROSIS THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW IS THAT HIGH-PROTEIN DIETS LEACH CALCIUM FROM BONE. NUTRITION EXPERTS I RELY ON SUGGEST THAT
PEOPLE AT RISK FOR OSTEOPOROSIS LIMIT THEIR PROTEIN INTAKE TO NO MORE THAN ONE
GRAM OF PROTEIN PER KILOGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO AROUND TWO
TO THREE OUNCES OF PROTEIN—ON THE ORDER OF ONE CHICKEN BREAST—DAILY FOR THE
AVERAGE WOMAN. MOST AMERICANS EAT CONSIDERABLY MORE PROTEIN THAN THIS, THUS
RUNNING A RISK OF CALCIUM LOSS EVEN IF THEY CONSUME A LOT OF THE MINERAL.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR OSTEOPOROSIS
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO CONSUME LESS PROTEIN AND MORE NUTRIENTS THAT HELP PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS, HERE ARE THE PLANT FOODS I'D SUGGEST.
W * CABBAGE (BRASSICA OLERACEA). BORON HELPS RAISE ESTROGEN LEVELS IN
THE BLOOD, AND ESTROGEN HELPS PRESERVE BONE. IN MY DATABASE, CABBAGE RANKS
HIGHEST IN BORON CONTENT AMONG LEAFY VEGGIES WITH 145 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM)
ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS.
I EAT A LOT OF COLESLAW, AND IT'S EASY TO COMBINE CABBAGE WITH HIGH-CALCIUM
BROCCOLI, KALE, BEANS AND TOFU IN SALADS AND STEAMED VEGETABLE DISHES. CABBAGE IS ALSO A KEY INGREDIENT IN MY BONE-STRENGTHENING BROTH.
VVV DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). SPEAKING OF BORON, DANDELION
SHOOTS RUN A CLOSE SECOND TO CABBAGE, WITH 125 PPM. DANDELION ALSO HAS MORE
THAN 20,000 PPM OF CALCIUM, MEANING THAT JUST TEN GRAMS (JUST UNDER SEVEN TABLESPOONS) OF DRIED DANDELION SHOOTS COULD PROVIDE MORE THAN 1 MILLIGRAM OF
BORON AND 200 MILLIGRAMS OF CALCIUM.
DANDELION IS ALSO A FAIR SOURCE OF SILICON, WHICH SOME STUDIES SUGGEST ALSO
340
OSTEOPOROSI S
HELPS STRENGTHEN BONE. I RECOMMEND
INCLUDING IT IN MY BONE-STRENGTHENING BROTH.
V%^ PIGWEED (AMARANTHUS,
VARIOUS SPECIES). ON A DRY-WEIGHT
BASIS, PIGWEED LEAVES ARE ONE OF OUR
BEST VEGETABLE SOURCES OF CALCIUM, AT
5.3 PERCENT. THIS MEANS THAT A SMALL
SERVING OF STEAMED LEAVES (½ OUNCE
OR '/IO CUP) PROVIDES A HEARTY 500
MILLIGRAMS OF CALCIUM. OTHER GOOD
PLANT SOURCES OF CALCIUM, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY, INCLUDE
LAMB'S-QUARTERS, BROAD BEANS, WATERCRESS, LICORICE, MARJORAM, SAVORY, RED
CLOVER SHOOTS, THYME, CHINESE CABBAGE (BOK CHOY), BASIL, CELERY SEED,
DANDELION AND PURSLANE.
VV AVOCADO (PERSEA AMERI- I
CARTA). AS ONE REPUTED VEGETABLE
SOURCE OF VITAMIN D (AND THE
TASTIEST), AVOCADO CAN HELP THE BODY
TURN CALCIUM INTO BONE. SOME PEOPLE
SHUN AVOCADOS BECAUSE THEY ARE
FAIRLY HIGH IN FAT, BUT IF YOU EAT A
GENERALLY LOW-FAT, VEGETARIAN OR
SEMI-VEGETARIAN DIET, I DON'T SEE
MUCH HARM IN THEM, ESPECIALLY IF
YOU'RE AT RISK FOR OSTEOPOROSIS. I SUGGEST MASHING AN AVOCADO INTO NONFAT
COTTAGE CHEESE OR YOGURT SO YOU GET
YOUR CALCIUM AND SOME VITAMIN D AT
THE SAME TIME. AVOCADOS ARE ALSO
RICH IN HEART-HEALTHY VITAMIN E.
^ V SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX) ^
AND OTHE R BEANS. VEGETARIAN AND
JAPANESE WOMEN HAVE A LOWER INCIDENCE OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND FRACTURES THAN
WESTERN OR MEAT-EATING WOMEN. THE REASON, ACCORDING TO JAMES ANDERSON,
M.D., OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN LEXINGTON, APPEARS
DOIK3 B
*FLRMLJIIIUILLLL G INVII I
HERE'S A RECIPE THAT WILL APPEAL TO THE
ECONOMY-MINDED WOMAN WHO IS EAGER TO
EXPLORE EVERY POSSIBLE AVENUE FOR PREVENTING OSTEOPOROSIS. BOTH THE FISH BONES
AND THE VEGGIES PROVIDE GENEROUS
AMOUNTS OF CALCIUM AND OTHER NUTRIENTS
THAT PREVENT THIS DEBILITATING DISEASE.
IN A LARGE POT, PLACE SOME LEFTOVER FISH BONES IN A FEW QUARTS OF WATER. (IF THE BONES
ARE REALLY TINY, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TIE THEM
IN A CHEESECLOTH BAG TO MAKE IT EASIER TO RETRIEVE THEM LATER.) BRING TO A BOIL, THEN
COVER AND SIMMER FOR 30 MINUTES. ADD A
COUPLE OF HANDFULS EACH OF FINELY CHOPPED
CABBAGE, DANDELION GREENS, STINGING NETTLE
GREENS, PARSLEY, PIGWEED AND PURSLANE.
(YOU'LL NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHEN HARVESTING
STINGING NETUE GREENS, BUT THE LEAVES LOSE
THEIR STING WHEN THE PLANT IS COOKED.)
SIMMER UNTIL THE GREENS SOFTEN SLIGHDY.
SEASON TO TASTE WITH SALT AND PEPPER
AND ANY OTHER SEASONINGS THAT APPEAL TO
YOU. REMOVE THE FISH BONES BEFORE SERVING.
SERVE AS A VEGETABLE/HERB SOUP TOPPED WITH
AVOCADO SLICES AND BLACK PEPPER. OR USE IT
AS A STOCK FOR EVEN HEARTIER BEAN SOUPS.
PROPERLY PREPARED, A GENEROUS SERVING
OF MY BONE-STRENGTHENING BROTH COULD
EASILY CONTAIN GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, BORON, BETA-CAROTENE
(PLUS OTHER VITAMIN A—LIKE CAROTENOIDS) AND
VITAMIN C, AS WELL AS SOME VITAMIN D, FLUORINE AND SILICON.
341
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TO BE THAT WESTERN-DIET MEAT-EATERS EXCRETE MORE CALCIUM IN THEIR URINE.
BEANS ARE A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN, BUT THEY CAUSE LESS CALCIUM LOSS IN THE
URINE THAN MEAT. IN ADDITION, SOYBEANS AND OTHER BEANS CONTAIN GENISTEIN, A PLANT
ESTROGEN (PHYTOESTROGEN) THAT ACTS LIKE THE FEMALE SEX HORMONE IN THE BODY.
PHARMACEUTICAL ESTROGEN REPLACEMENT HELPS PRESERVE BONE AND PREVENT
HEART DISEASE, BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISK OF BREAST CANCER. GENISTEIN FROM
BEANS HAS NEVER BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE CANCER RISK, AND FD BE WILLING TO BET
THAT A DIET RICH IN BEANS WOULD STRENGTHEN BONE AND PREVENT HEART DISEASE ALMOST AS WELL AS, OR EQUALLY AS WELL AS, ESTROGEN PILLS.
V BLACK PEPPE R (PIPER NIGRUM). ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, BLACK
PEPPER CONTAINS FOUR ANTI-OSTEOPOROSIS COMPOUNDS. IF YOU LIKE PEPPER, YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER SPRINKLING IT GENEROUSLY ON YOUR AVOCADO OR BEAN SOUP OR SALAD,
ASSUMING THAT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS.
V HORSETAIL (EQUISETUM ARVENSE). FRENCH RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SILICON HELPS PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS AND CAN BE USED TO TREAT BONE FRACTURES. HORSETAIL IS AMONG THE RICHEST PLANT SOURCES OF THIS MINERAL, IN THE FORM OF THE
COMPOUND MONOSILICIC ACID, WHICH THE BODY CAN READILY USE.
AGING AND LOW ESTROGEN LEVELS DECREASE THE BODY'S ABILITY TO ABSORB SILICON. SOME PEOPLE RECOMMEND UP TO NINE 350-MILLIGRAM CAPSULES A DAY. YOU
SHOULD USE THIS HERB ONLY IN CONSULTATION WITH A HOLISTIC PRACTITIONER. IF YOU'RE
ADVISED TO USE HORSETAIL TEA, ADD A TEASPOON OF SUGAR TO THE WATER ALONG WITH
THE DRIED HERB. (THE SUGAR WILL PULL MORE SILICON OUT OF THE PLANT.) BRING IT TO A
BOIL, THEN LET IT SIMMER FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS. STRAIN OUT THE LEAVES, THEN LET THE
TEA COOL BEFORE DRINKING.
V PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CRISPUM). THAT DARK GREEN GARNISH, WHICH IS
SO OFTEN THROWN AWAY INSTEAD OF EATEN, IS GENEROUSLY ENDOWED WITH BORON. IT
WOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE OUNCES OF DRIED PARSLEY TO PROVIDE THE THREE MILLIGRAMS
DEEMED USEFUL IN RAISING ESTROGEN LEVELS. THAT'S MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE WANT
TO CONSUME, BUT EVERY SPRIG HELPS.
IN MY DATABASE, PARSLEY IS ALSO AMONG THE HIGHEST FOOD SOURCES OF FLUORINE, ANOTHER BONE STRENGTHENER. FRESHEN YOUR BREATH WHILE YOU SAVE YOUR
BONES BY ROUTINELY EATING EVERY SPRIG OF PARSLEY GARNISH PLACED ON YOUR PLATE
IN RESTAURANTS.

I
'VE ALWAYS LIKED THIS LETTER:
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! I KNOW HOW BUSY YOU MUST BE, DR. DUKE, BUT
I HOPE PM NOT BEING TOO PRESUMPTUOUS ASKING FOR THE RECIPE FOR THOSE LEAN
342
OVERWEIGH T
MEAN BRAN MUFFINS THAT YOU MENTIONED IN USA TODAY. OH, DO I NEED TO ACTIVATE MY SEROTONIN!!
"I NEVER HAD A WEIGHT PROBLEM UNTIL TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN OLD AGE CAUGHT
UP WITH ME. PLEASE FIND IT IN YOUR GENEROUS HEART TO HONOR MY REQUEST, AND HELP
ME SHED THOSE 25 UNWANTED POUNDS. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE
(KISS, KISS, KISS!!!)."
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LAY A LITTLE BIOCHEMISTRY ON THE NATIONAL
PRESS. A FEW YEARS BACK, A USA TODAY REPORTER INTERVIEWED ME ABOUT NATURAL
SECRETS OF WEIGHT CONTROL. FOR THE MOST PART, THERE ARE NO SECRETS: JUST EAT A LOWFAT DIET HEAVY ON FRUITS, VEGETABLES, HERBS AND WHOLE GRAINS AND GET PLENTY OF
EXERCISE.
BUT YOU KNOW THE MEDIA—ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW. SO I MENTIONED TO THE REPORTER THAT SEROTONIN IS THE BRAIN CHEMICAL RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
FEELING OF SATIETY, AND THAT PUMPING UP ONE'S SEROTONIN MIGHT HELP PEOPLE SHUT
THE REFRIGERATOR.
A KEY INGREDIENT IN SEROTONIN IS THE AMINO ACID TRYPTOPHAN. PERHAPS
YOU'VE HEARD THAT TRYPTOPHAN IS A SEDATIVE. A FEW YEARS BACK THERE WAS A BIG
MARKET FOR TRYPTOPHAN SUPPLEMENTS. THEN SOME PEOPLE GOT SICK AFTER TAKING
SUPPLEMENTS FROM A CONTAMINATED BATCH, AND THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) OVERREACTED BY BANNING IT FROM HEALTH FOOD STORES. BUT THE FDA
CAN'T BAN THE TRYPTOPHAN IN FOOD.
THAT'S WHERE MY LEAN MEAN BRAN MUFFINS COME IN. (THE RECIPE IS ON PAGE
344.) THEY PROVIDE PLENTY OF TRYPTOPHAN TO SUPPORT SEROTONIN SYNTHESIS IN THE
BRAIN, WHICH HELPS YOU GET THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'RE FULL.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR OVERWEIGHT
IF MUFFINS DON'T MOVE YOU, YOU MIGHT TRY THE HERBS THAT MAY HELP PEOPLE
CONTROL THEIR WEIGHT.
V"*^ PLANTAIN OR PSYLLIUM {PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). PLANTAIN IS A
LEAFY PLANT, AND PSYLLIUM IS THE SEED OF THE PLANT. IN ONE ITALIAN STUDY, SCIENTISTS
GAVE WOMEN WHO WERE SERIOUSLY OBESE—AT LEAST 60 PERCENT OVER THEIR RECOMMENDED WEIGHT—THREE GRAMS OF PLANTAIN IN WATER 30 MINUTES BEFORE MEALS. THE
PLANTAIN GROUP LOST MORE WEIGHT THAN A SIMILAR GROUP OF WOMEN WHO SIMPLY CUT
BACK ON THEIR DIET.
RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT THE WEIGHT-LOSS EFFECT OF PLANTAIN AND
PSYLLIUM IS RELATED TO THE SPONGY FIBER (MUCILAGE) IN THE SEEDS AND TO SPECIFIC
CHEMICALS (POLYPHENOLS) IN THE LEAVES.
IT MAY NOT BE PRACTICAL TO MAKE A PLANTAIN-IN-WATER MIXTURE, BUT GETTING
PSYLLIUM IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL, SINCE METAMUCIL AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS CONTAIN

LEAN MEAN BRAN MUFFINS
AFTER USA TODAY MENTIONED MY LEAN MEAN BRAN MUFFIN RECIPE, I GOT DOZENS OF LETTERS ASKING FOR IT. LITTLE DID THE LETTER WRITERS KNOW THAT I NEVER MAKE MY CONCOCTIONS—MUFFINS, TEAS, SOUPS, SALADS—THE SAME WAY TWICE. I JUST USE A HANDFUL OF
THIS AND A PINCH OF THAT, DEPENDING ON MY MOOD AND WHAT I HAVE ON HAND. BUT I
KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE PREFER SPECIFIC RECIPES, SO I HAD MY GOOD FRIEND, NUTRITIONIST
LEIGH BROADHURST, PH.D., PUT THIS ONE TOGETHER JUST FOR THIS BOOK.
THIS RECIPE REQUIRES THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO EVENING PRIMROSE PLANTS. BEFORE
STARTING THE RECIPE, COLLECT SOME EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS. STORE THEM IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND JUST BEFORE MAKING THE MUFFINS, GRIND THEM IN A SPICE MILL OR AN ELECTRIC COFFEE

W V RED PEPPE R (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER HOT SPICES.
IN ONE EXPERIMENT, RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE IN ENGLAND MEASURED THE METABOLIC RATES OF PEOPLE ON A STANDARDIZED DIET, THEN ADDED A TEASPOON
OF RED-PEPPER SAUCE AND A TEASPOON OF MUSTARD TO EVERY MEAL. THE STUDY SHOWED

OVERWEIGH T
PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 475°. PLACE THE RACK IN THE CENTER OF THE OVEN.
LINE A 12-CUP MUFFIN PAN WITH PAPER MUFFIN CUPS. (FOR BEST RESULTS, DO NOT USE A
NONSTICK PAN WITHOUT PAPER LINERS.)
WITH YOUR HANDS, CRUSH THE BRAN FLAKES INTO UNIFORM SMALL PIECES, BUT NOT CRUMBS.
IN A SMALL BOWL, MIX THE BRAN FLAKES WITH THE WALNUTS AND/OR SUNFLOWER SEEDS, RAISINS
OR CHERRIES AND EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS. SET ASIDE.
IN A LARGE BOWL, STIR TOGETHER THE FLOUR, OATS, CORNMEAL, SUGAR, BAKING POWDER, CINNAMON OR PIE SPICE (IF USING), BAKING POWDER, BAKING SODA AND SALT. ADD THE BRAN
FLAKE MIXTURE AND STIR TOGETHER.
PLACE THE APPLES OR PEARS, BUTTERMILK, EGG AND OIL IN A FOOD PROCESSOR OR BLENDER
AND PROCESS UNTIL THE FRUIT IS COARSELY PUREED. FOLD THE FRUIT MIXTURE INTO THE FLOUR
MIXTURE, STIRRING GENTLY TO COMBINE.
FILL THE MUFFIN CUPS TO THE TOP AND SPRINKLE THE TOPS WITH THE SESAME SEEDS (IF
USING). PLACE THE PAN IN THE CENTER OF THE OVEN AND IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE TO 375°. BAKE FOR 20 TO 25 MINUTES, OR UNTIL THE MUFFINS ARE LIGHTLY BROWNED
AND FIRM TO THE TOUCH.
LET COOL IN THE PAN FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN REMOVE THE MUFFINS FROM THE PAN AND
PLACE THEM ON A RACK TO COOL COMPLETELY. SERVE WITHIN 24 HOURS OR STORE IN AN AIRTIGHT CONTAINER OR A BAG IN THE FREEZER.
NOTES: SINCE CEREALS VARY, YOU CAN USE THE LABEL INFORMATION ON THE BRAN FLAKES PACKAGETO CONVERT FROM WEIGHT TO VOLUME. TWO OUNCES CAN BE 1 ½ TO 1½ CUPS, DEPENDING ON THECEREAL.
SESAME OIL IS AVAILABLE IN MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES AND IN INDIAN GROCERY STORES.
VARIATION: SUBSTITUTE 1 BANANA OR 1 CUP APPLESAUCE OR OTHER FRUIT SAUCE FOR THE APPLE
OR PEAR.

J
THAT THE HOT HERBS RAISED METABOLIC RATES BY AS MUCH AS 25 PERCENT.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT, YOU GET ANOTHER BENEFIT FROM EATING SPICY
FOODS. THE HOT SPICE STIMULATES THIRST, SO YOU DRINK MORE LIQUIDS. IF YOU FILL UP ON
WATER INSTEAD OF FOOD, YOU'LL OBVIOUSLY TAKE IN FEWER CALORIES AND GAIN LESS WEIGHT.
SO HOT, SPICY FOODS JUST MIGHT HELP YOU KEEP YOUR WEIGHT DOWN. ONE
CAVEAT, THOUGH: MANY PEOPLE USE HOT SPICES IN BARBECUE SAUCE ON HIGH-FAT
FOODS SUCH AS SPARERIBS, HOT DOGS AND SAUSAGES. IF YOU HAVE A YEN FOR BARBECUE
345
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SAUCE, SKIP THE FAT WITH MY HOT DOGGONE. TO A HOT DOG BUN, ADD COLESLAW, BARBECUE SAUCE, MUSTARD AND ONIONS. I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD, BUT THIS CONCOCTION
IS SURPRISINGLY SATISFYING. (IT'S BEST TO LEAVE OUT THE HOT DOG, BUT IF YOU MUST
HAVE ONE, MAKE IT VEGETARIAN.)
VV CHICKWEED1
 (STELLARIA MEDIA). THIS HERB HAS QUITE A FOLK REPUTATION
AS A SLIMMER. TRY ADDING SOME TO YOUR DIET AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
SOME PEOPLE EAT IT RAW IN SALADS, AND SOME STEAM IT AND EAT IT LIKE A VEGETABLE. PERSONALLY, I PREFER TO DISGUISE IT BY INCLUDING IT WITH OTHER GREENS. IF YOU
WANT TO TRY MY WEED FEED MIXTURE OF SLIMMING, EDIBLE WEEDS, MIX CHICKWEED,
DANDELION, EVENING PRIMROSE, STINGING NETTLE (COOKED AND COOLED), PLANTAIN AND
PURSLANE. YOU CAN EAT THIS MIXTURE OF FRESH HERBS IN A SALAD. YOU CAN ALSO COOK
ALL OF THE GREENS AND PERHAPS SPICE THEM UP WITH SLIMMING HOT SAUCE.
' W EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). IF YOU'D RATHER NOT GRIND
EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS INTO FLOUR AS I SUGGEST IN MY LEAN MEAN BRAN MUFFIN
RECIPE, TRY TAKING A HALF-TEASPOON OF EVENING PRIMROSE OIL THREE TIMES A DAY. THE OIL
CONTAINS SOME TRYPTOPHAN, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FLOUR.
^ V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). WHEN I WAS IN COSTA RICA, STAYING AT
THE MONTE VERDE LODGE AND ENJOYING THE BEAUTY AND COMFORT OF THE MONTE VERDE
CLOUD FOREST, THE OWNER OF THE LODGE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD LOST 100 POUNDS ON A
PINEAPPLE REGIMEN. HE ATE ONE WHOLE FRESH PINEAPPLE PER DAY.
ALTHOUGH HIS STORY MIGHT SOUND APOCRYPHAL, THERE'S MORE TO A PINEAPPLE
DIET THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. PINEAPPLE CONTAINS AN ENZYME CALLED BROMELAIN,
WHICH HELPS DIGEST BOTH PROTEINS AND FATS.
VV WALNUT (JUGUTNS, VARIOUS SPECIES). YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NUTS, WHICH
ARE HIGH IN FAT, SHOULD BE AVOIDED BY ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT. BUT A
STUDY OF MORE THAN 25,000 SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO ATE THE
MOST NUTS WERE THE LEAST OBESE. WALNUTS ARE OUR RICHEST DIETARY SOURCE OF SEROTONIN, WHICH, AS MENTIONED EARLIER, HELPS MAKE US FEEL FULL. POSSIBLY THE NUTS PRODUCED FEELINGS OF SATIETY.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND, HOWEVER, THAT SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS ARE
VEGETARIANS WHO LIVE A MUCH HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE THAN THE TYPICAL AMERICAN. IT'S
NOT CLEAR THAT NUTS WOULD HELP YOU CONTROL YOUR WEIGHT IF YOU'RE AN OMNIVORE
EATING BOTH MEAT AND VEGETABLES. BUT YOU MIGHT EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF EATING A
HANDFUL OF WALNUTS HELPS YOU CONTROL FOOD CRAVINGS.

PAIN
T
HE WORST PAIN I EVER HAD WAS CAUSED BY A SLIPPED DISK. IT WAS JUST LIKE
THE PAIN I'D EXPERIENCED FROM TIME TO TIME WITH GOUT—UNBEARABLE. MY
DOCTOR DID WHAT DOCTORS DO: HE GAVE ME POTENTIALLY ADDICTIVE PAIN PILLS AND
NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS. I TOOK MORE DRUGS FOR THAT SLIPPED DISK
THAN FD EVER TAKEN IN MY LIFE. I ALSO TOOK MORE HERBS THAN I'D EVER PREVIOUSLY
TAKEN, TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS.
DOCTORS RECOGNIZE TWO KINDS OF PAIN, ACUTE AND CHRONIC. ACUTE PAIN COMES
ON SUDDENLY, TYPICALLY SUBSIDES WITH TIME AND USUALLY IS ALLEVIATED WITH
COMMON PAIN RELIEVERS. EXAMPLES WOULD BE A HEADACHE OR THE PAIN OF AN INJURY. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BEGIN AS ACUTE PAIN, BUT IT LASTS MUCH LONGER—MONTHS
OR EVEN YEARS—AND OFTEN CANNOT BE RELIEVED USING STANDARD THERAPIES. THOSE
WITH CHRONIC PAIN OFTEN WIND UP IN A PERSONAL HELL. THEIR PAIN CAN MAKE THEM
DEPRESSED, AND WITH DEPRESSION THE PAIN MAY BECOME WORSE AND BE MORE
DIFFICULT TO TREAT.
IF YOU HAVE PERSISTENT PAIN, SEE A DOCTOR FOR A DIAGNOSIS. ONCE THE CAUSE
HAS BEEN FIGURED OUT, RATIONAL TREATMENT BECOMES POSSIBLE. BUT IF, LIKE MANY
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN, YOU DON'T GET A CLEAR DIAGNOSIS AND YOUR PAIN
GOES ON AND ON, I'D SUGGEST CONSULTING A PAIN CLINIC. THESE MEDICAL CLINICS,
WHICH ARE RELATIVE NEWCOMERS TO THE HEALTH-CARE SCENE, USE A VARIETY OF DRUGS
AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO HELP YOU CONTROL YOUR PAIN EVEN IF YOU CAN'T COMPLETELY ELIMINATE IT. AMONG THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES USED IN SOME PAIN
CLINICS ARE EXERCISE, MEDITATION AND BIOFEEDBACK.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PAIN
THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP.
W V CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM). DENTISTS AROUND THE COUNTRY RECOMMEND CLOVE OIL AS FIRST AID FOR TOOTHACHE, AND IN FACT, IT'S WHAT MY MOTHER USED TO
GIVE ME FOR TOOTHACHE. IT WORKS, AND ITS USE IS ENDORSED BY COMMISSION E, THE
GROUP THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GONVERNMENT ON HERBAL MEDICINE. YOU APPLY THIS
OIL DIRECTLY TO THE PAINFUL TOOTH.
W V RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). RED PEPPER CONTAINS
PAIN-RELIEVING SALICYLATES, CHEMICALS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO SALICIN, THE HERBAL EQUIVALENT OF ASPIRIN. IN FACT, RED PEPPER ONCE RANKED AS THE BEST FOOD-GRADE SOURCE OF
SALICYLATES, ALTHOUGH A NEW STUDY HAS DOWNGRADED IT CONSIDERABLY. THIS HERB ALSO
CONTAINS CAPSAICIN, A COMPOUND THAT STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF THE BODY'S NATURAL
PAINKILLERS, CALLED ENDORPHINS.
347
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SOME FOLKS LIKE THE SPICY TASTE OF RED PEPPER. I KNOW I DO. I SUGGEST USING
MORE OF THIS WONDERFUL SPICE IN YOUR COOKING.
CAPSAICIN ALSO WORKS WHEN USED EXTERNALLY BY INTERFERING WITH SUBSTANCE P, A
PAIN TRANSMITTER IN THE SKIN. SO MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN BENEFITS FROM APPLYING
CAPSAICIN EXTERNALLY THAT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED PAIN-RELIEVING
SKIN CREAMS CONTAINING 0.025 PERCENT CAPSAICIN (ZOSTRIX, CAPZASIN-P) FOR THE TREATMENT OF ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM. (IF YOU USE A CAPSAICIN CREAM, BE SURE TO WASH
YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD: YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT IN YOUR EYES. ALSO, SINCE
SOME PEOPLE ARE QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS COMPOUND, YOU SHOULD TEST IT ON A SMALL AREA
OF SKIN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO USE BEFORE USING IT ON A LARGER AREA. IF IT
SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE.)
V*>. WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK CONTAINS SALICIN. IN FACT,
MOST PLANTS CONTAIN SOME SALICIN OR RELATED SALICYLATES. JUST 100 YEARS AGO, ASPIRIN
WAS DERIVED FROM SEVERAL PLANTS THAT CONTAIN MORE OF THESE COMPOUNDS THAN MOST:
WILLOW, MEADOWSWEET AND WINTERGREEN. WHEN MEDICINES HAVE BEEN IN SHORT SUPPLY
DURING WARTIME, DOCTORS IN SOME COUNTRIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GONE BACK TO USING
WILLOW BARK FOR PAIN RELIEF.
COMMISSION E RECOGNIZES WILLOW BARK AS AN EFFECTIVE PAIN RELIEVER FOR
EVERYTHING FROM HEADACHE TO ARTHRITIS.
FOR MANY KINDS OF PAIN RELIEF, I'D START WITH ABOUT A HALF-TEASPOON OF
SALICIN-RICH WILLOW BARK OR UP TO AS MUCH AS FIVE TEASPOONS OF WHITE WILLOW (5.
ALBA), WHICH HAS A LOWER SALICIN CONCENTRATION. OF COURSE, NOT EVERYONE KNOWS
WHICH SPECIES THEY HAVE, AND SALICIN CONTENT VARIES FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES.
SO I'D SUGGEST STARTING WITH A LOW-DOSE TEA AND WORKING YOUR WAY UP TO A DOSE
THAT PROVIDES EFFECTIVE PAIN RELIEF.
IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS,
EITHER. ALSO, YOU SHOULD NOT GIVE EITHER ASPIRIN OR ITS NATURAL HERBAL ALTERNATIVES TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE PAIN WITH VIRAL INFECTIONS SUCH AS COLDS OR FLU.
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT DEVELOP REYE'S SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY FATAL
CONDITION THAT DAMAGES THE LIVER AND BRAIN.
W EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THIS HERB IS ONE OF OUR BEST
SOURCES OF THE AMINO ACID TRYPTOPHAN. IN STUDIES, TRYPTOPHAN SUPPLEMENTS HAVE
REDUCED PAIN CAUSED BY ACUTE AND CHRONIC ILLNESS AND ALSO INCREASED PEOPLE'S
ABILITY TO TOLERATE PAIN. NATUROPATHS OFTEN RECOMMEND TAKING ONE GRAM OF EVENING
PRIMROSE OIL FOUR TIMES A DAY TO RELIEVE THE PAIN AND NERVE DAMAGE OF DIABETIC
NEUROPATHY, A PARTICULARLY PAINFUL CONDITION THAT SOMETIMES DEVELOPS IN PEOPLE
WITH DIABETES. I'D SUGGEST TAKING POWDERED SEEDS INSTEAD, BECAUSE EVENING PRIMROSE LOSES MUCH OF ITS TRYPTOPHAN IN THE OIL-EXTRACTION PROCESS.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). FEW PEOPLE THINK OF GINGER AS A PAIN RE348
PAIN
LIEVER, BUT IT IS. IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS RECRUITED 56 PEOPLE—28 WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, 18 WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND 10 WITH THE PAINFUL MUSCLE CONDITION FIBROMYALGIA—AND GAVE THEM TWO TO FOUR TEASPOONS OF POWDERED GINGER A DAY. AFTER
THREE MONTHS, MORE THAN 75 PERCENT REPORTED SIGNIFICANT PAIN RELIEF WITH NO SIDE
EFFECTS.
YOU CAN ALSO USE GINGER EXTERNALLY. HOT GINGER COMPRESSES SEEM TO HELP
RELIEVE ABDOMINAL CRAMPS, HEADACHE AND JOINT STIFFNESS. I'D SUGGEST ADDING HOT
PEPPER TO THESE COMPRESSES.
VV KAVA KAVA (PIPER METHYSTICUM). THIS TROPICAL HERB CONTAINS TWO
PAIN-RELIEVING CHEMICALS, DIHYDROKAVAIN AND DIHYDROMETHYSTICIN, WHICH HAVE
ANALGESIC EFFECTIVENESS COMPARABLE TO THAT OF ASPIRIN. ALTHOUGH KAVA KAVA HAS
BEEN DESCRIBED AS A NARCOTIC, IT IS NONADDICTIVE. WHEN YOU CHEW THE LEAF, YOUR
MOUTH GOES NUMB. AS A RESULT, THIS PLANT MIGHT BE USED TO RELIEVE THE PAINFUL
SYMPTOMS OF SORE THROAT, SORE GUMS, CANKER SORES OR EVEN TOOTHACHE.
VV LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). LAVENDER OIL IS AROMATHERAPY'S TOP TREATMENT FOR PAIN, AND IN FACT, THIS OIL WAS IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR
OF AROMATHERAPY'S BEGINNINGS. IN THE 1920S, AROMATHERAPY'S FOUNDER, FRENCH PERFUME CHEMIST REN^-MAURICE GATTEFOSSE\ HAPPENED TO BURN HIS HAND IN A LABORATORY ACCIDENT. PLUNGING HIS HAND INTO THE NEAREST COOL LIQUID, LAVENDER OIL,
GATTEFOSSE* EXPERIENCED RAPID RELIEF. SINCE THEN, RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
SOME ESSENTIAL OILS REDUCE THE FLOW OF NERVE IMPULSES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT
TRANSMIT PAIN. IN LAVENDER OIL, THE KEY CONSTITUENTS APPEAR TO BE LINALOOL AND
LINALYL ALDEHYDE.
YOU CAN MIX A FEW DROPS OF LAVENDER OIL IN A TABLESPOON OF VEGETABLE OIL
AND MASSAGE IT INTO THE PAINFUL AREA.
VV MOUNTAIN MINT (PYCNANTHEMUM MUTICUM). THIS HERB IS HIGH IN
PULEGONE, A CHEMICAL SIMILAR TO CAPSAICIN THAT ALSO HAS PAIN-RELIEVING EFFECTS. I SUGGEST MAKING A TASTY TEA,
THEN USING THE SPENT LEAVES (OR FRESH
ONES) AS A POULTICE ON PAINFUL AREAS.
(DON'T USE THIS TREATMENT IF YOU ARE
PREGNANT, HOWEVER.)
V%> PEPPERMINT (MENTHA
PIPERITA). MENTHOL, THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IN PEPPERMINT, HAS ANESTHETIC EFFECTS. IN ONE STUDY, SCIENTISTS
ASKED 32 PEOPLE WHO HAD HEADACHES
TO MASSAGE TINCTURE OF PEPPERMINT
HERE'S A PAIN-RELIEVING HERBAL BLEND TO
KEEP ON HAND: WILLOW BARK, RED PEPPER,
CLOVES, GINGER, PEPPERMINT AND MOUNTAIN
MINT. JUST MIX WHICHEVER OF THESE HERBS
ARE AVAILABLE IN PROPORTIONS THAT APPEAL TO
YOUR TASTE. YOU CAN USE THIS MIXTURE TO
MAKE A TEA WHENEVER YOU FEEL THE NEED, OR
YOU CAN MAKE A POULTICE TO APPLY DIRECTLY
TO PAINFUL AREAS.
349
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
OIL ON THEIR TEMPLES. THIS HAD SIGNIFICANT PAIN-RELIEVING EFFECTS. BUT IF YOU TRY PEPPERMINT OIL, BE SURE TO DILUTE IT BY ADDING A FEW DROPS TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF
ANY VEGETABLE OIL. PURE PEPPERMINT OIL CAN BE IRRITATING TO THE SKIN. AND NEVER INGEST THE OIL; A VERY SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.
W SUNFLOWER (HETIANTHUS ANNUUS). SUNFLOWER SEEDS ARE AMONG THE BEST
SOURCES OF PHENYLALANINE, A CHEMICAL INVOLVED IN PAIN CONTROL. STUDIES SUGGEST
THAT PHENYLALANINE HELPS REDUCE PAIN BY INHIBITING THE BREAKDOWN OF ENKEPHALINS,
CHEMICALS INVOLVED IN PAIN PERCEPTION. IN STUDIES WITH BOTH HUMANS AND ANIMALS,
PHENYLALANINE MAKES ACUPUNCTURE MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING PAIN. IN LABORATORY
RATS, THE CHEMICAL ENHANCED THE EFFECT OF MORPHINE AND MADE IT LAST LONGER.
IF I WERE IN PAIN, I'D EAT A HANDFUL OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS—I'M A HABITUAL SEED
MUNCHER ANYHOW—AND USE GROUND SEEDS IN A POULTICE ON PAINFUL AREAS.
W TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). MANY CLINICAL STUDIES AGREE THAT THE CURCUMIN IN TURMERIC HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN RELIEVING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN A SHAKE OF THE
SPICE JAR TO GAIN THIS BENEFIT. THE DOSE NATUROPATHS RECOMMEND IS 400 MILLIGRAMS
THREE TIMES A DAY. TO GET THAT MUCH, YOU'D HAVE TO CONSUME AT LEAST ONE-THIRD OF
AN OUNCE OF THIS HERB. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY TURMERIC FOR PAIN, I'D SUGGEST TAKING
CAPSULES, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN. (EMPTY GELATIN CAPSULES CAN BE PURCHASED AT HEALTH FOOD STORES.)
V EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS). AROMATHERAPISTS OFTEN SUGGEST
ADDING EUCALYPTUS OIL TO THE PAIN-RELIEVING ESSENTIAL OILS OF LAVENDER AND PEPPERMINT. THE COMPOUND CINEOLE, WHICH IS FOUND IN EUCALYPTUS, SPEEDS ABSORPTION OF
THE OTHER AROMATIC PAIN RELIEVERS THROUGH THE SKIN. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT THESE
OILS ARE BEST RESERVED FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.
V ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). COMMISSION E RECOMMENDS
USING TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED ROSEMARY TO MAKE A CUP OF PAIN-RELIEVING
TEA. FOR A BATH THAT WILL CERTAINLY RELAX YOU AND MAY PROVIDE PAIN RELIEF, FILL A CLOTH
BAG WITH TWO OUNCES OF ROSEMARY AND TOSS IT INTO YOUR BATHWATER.
PARKINSON'S DISEASE
B
ACK IN 1991,1 SPENT THREE MINUTES ON THE CBS MORNING SHOW WITH
PAULA ZAHN. THE SHOW, WHICH WAS CALLED "MEALS THAT HEAL," WAS
ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE TOPICS, USING FOOD AS MEDICINE. I HAPPENED TO MENTION THAT FAVA BEANS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS, INCLUDING
350
PARKINSON' S DISEAS E
PARKINSON'S DISEASE. SHORTLY AFTERWARD, I RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM A
YOUNG WOMAN: "PLEASE SEND ME.. . ANY RESEARCH PERTAINING TO PARKINSON'S. I
COORDINATE A NATIONAL GROUP CALLED YOUNGER PARKINSON PEOPLE. AN INCREASING
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOW DIAGNOSED IN THEIR EARLY THIRTIES. I AM 43, DIAGNOSED
AT 36. PLEASE SEND ANY NEW INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US."
I SENT THE WOMAN INFORMATION ON MY TOP CHOICE HERB FOR TREATING
PARKINSON'S DISEASE—FAVA BEANS. BUT BEFORE I DISCUSS THESE TASTY AND VERSATILE BEANS IN DETAIL, I'D BETTER SAY A WORD ABOUT PARKINSON'S DISEASE.
IT'S ACTUALLY A GROUP OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS CHARACTERIZED BY TREMBLING
AND SHAKING, SLOWING OF MOVEMENT, LOSS OF MUSCLE CONTROL AND MUSCLE RIGIDITY.
AN ESTIMATED 450,000 AMERICANS HAVE PARKINSON'S; MOST ARE OVER 60. AMONG
THE ELDERLY, ABOUT 1 IN 200 PEOPLE HAS PARKINSON'S. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY
50,000 NEW DIAGNOSES EACH YEAR. MEN ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN WOMEN.
PARKINSON'S IS A SERIOUS CONDITION. ANYONE WHO HAS IT SHOULD BE UNDER A
PHYSICIAN'S CARE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE
IN ADDITION TO FOLLOWING YOUR PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE, THERE ARE SEVERAL HERBS
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO INVESTIGATE. BUT IF YOU'RE UNDER A DOCTOR'S CARE FOR
PARKINSON'S, YOU'LL CERTAINLY WANT TO CONFER BEFORE TRYING ANY NATURAL THERAPIES.
HERE ARE SOME OPTIONS.
V W FAVA BEAN {VICIA FAB A). THESE BEANS ARE ONE OF NATURE'S BEST PLANT
SOURCES OF A COMPOUND CALLED L-DOPA, THE NATURAL PRECURSOR OF DOPAMINE IN THE
BRAIN. IN PARKINSON'S, AN IMBALANCE DEVELOPS IN THE BRAIN BETWEEN TWO CHEMICALS,
DOPAMINE AND ACETYLCHOLINE, USUALLY DUE TO DEGENERATION OF THE CELLS THAT PRODUCE
DOPAMINE. IF YOUR BRAIN MAKES LESS DOPAMINE, TAKING L-DOPA CAN HELP THINGS
ALONG. L-DOPA IS A STANDARD THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S.
THE TROUBLE WITH L-DOPA IS THAT AS A PHARMACEUTICAL IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE,
AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S CAN'T AFFORD IT. BUT FAVA BEANS ARE CHEAP.
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS, IT TAKES ABOUT A 16-OUNCE CAN OF FAVA BEANS TO
GET ENOUGH L-DOPA TO HAVE A PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT ON PARKINSON'S. AT MY SUPERMARKET, A 16-OUNCE CAN COSTS $1.15. TRY BUYING PHARMACEUTICAL L-DOPA FOR
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.
EVEN MORE INTRIGUING, THE LATEST NEWS IS THAT FAVA BEAN SPROUTS CONTAIN TEN
TIMES MORE L-DOPA THAN THE UNSPROUTED BEANS. THAT REDUCES THE COST OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL DOSE TO JUST OVER 10 CENTS—THE COST OF A HANDUL OF SPROUTS. EVEN
THOUGH I'VE DISCUSSED THE POTENTIAL OF FAVA BEANS WITH DOZENS OF PEOPLE OVER
THE LAST FIVE YEARS, I KNOW OF NO ONE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE WHO HAS TAKEN
THE FOOD APPROACH SERIOUSLY.
351
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD FAVA BEANS TO YOUR DIET, IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU
LET YOUR DOCTOR KNOW THAT YOU ARE DOING SO, AND WHY. (IT MIGHT HELP TO TAKE
ALONG A COPY OF THIS BOOK.) MOST CASES OF PARKINSON'S GET OFF TO A SLOW, MILD
START, AND DOCTORS DON'T USUALLY PRESCRIBE L-DOPA UNTIL THE DISEASE IS MORE
ADVANCED. I SUSPECT THAT EATING MORE FAVA BEANS AT THIS EARLY STAGE WOULD BE
REALLY HELPFUL. IF YOU ARE ALREADY TAKING L-DOPA, HOWEVER, DO NOT START EATING
THESE BEANS UNLESS YOU DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
IN ADDITION TO L-DOPA, FAVA BEANS (AND OTHER LEGUMES) ALSO CONTAIN CHOLINE
AND LECITHIN. SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THESE COMPOUNDS MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE
EFFECTS IN PREVENTING PARKINSON'S OR MIGHT HELP RELIEVE SOME OF ITS SYMPTOMS.
FAVA BEANS ARE ALSO HIGH IN FIBER, WHICH HELPS PREVENT CONSTIPATION, A
COMMON PROBLEM IN PARKINSON'S. BUT AS I MENTIONED, TO GET A PHYSIOLOGICALLY
MEANINGFUL DOSE OF L-DOPA FROM FAVA BEANS, YOU HAVE TO EAT A POUND OF THEM
(OR ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF SPROUTS).
IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO WITH THE BEANS, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR NOTORIOUS
PROBLEM—GAS.
FOR SOME PEOPLE, BEANS GET EASIER TO HANDLE INTESTINALLY AS YOU EAT MORE
OF THEM. IN PREPARATION FOR THE CBS MORNING SHOW, I ATE A 16-OUNCE CAN OF FAVA
BEANS ONE DAY AT LUNCH. WITHIN TWO HOURS, THE EXPECTED SIDE EFFECT ENSUED.
THE NEXT DAY, I ATE A SECOND CAN. AGAIN I BECAME GASSY, BUT NOT UNTIL FOUR
HOURS LATER. BY THE THIRD CAN, ON DAY THREE, MY GUT SEEMED TO HAVE ADJUSTED,
AND GAS WASN'T MUCH OF A PROBLEM.
SO, BEAN EATERS, THERE IS HOPE. AND IF YOUR GUT DOESN'T ADJUST, YOU CAN TRY
BEANO, AN OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT THAT HELPS REDUCE FLATULENCE FROM BEANS.
IT'S AVAILABLE AT MOST DRUGSTORES; JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE LABEL.
W * VELVET BEAN (MUCUNA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). LIKE FAVA BEANS, VELVET
BEANS CONTAIN A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF L-DOPA, AROUND 50,000 PARTS PER MILLION. BUT
UNLIKE FAVA BEANS, VELVET BEANS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN USED IN CLINICAL TRIALS TO TREAT
PARKINSON'S.
THE STUDY WITH VELVET BEANS WAS DONE BY RESEARCHERS AT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS
UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN SPRINGFIELD UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF B. V.
MANYAM, M.D. THE RESEARCHERS USED A VELVET BEAN PREPARATION CALLED HP-0,
WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE INNER PART OF THE BEAN. THE HP-0 WAS STANDARDIZED
SO THAT EACH GRAM OF THE PREPARATION CONTAINED 33.33 MILLIGRAMS OF L-DOPA.
FROM THE TRIALS, RESEARCHERS CONCLUDED THAT THEIR BEAN PREPARATION WAS EFFECTIVE. UNFORTUNATELY, AS FAR AS I KNOW, THIS PREPARATION IS STILL PROPRIETARY AND
EXPERIMENTAL, SO IT'S NOT AVAILABLE. BUT PLAIN OLD VELVET BEANS ARE. LIKE FAVA
BEANS, THEY ARE HIGH IN FIBER.
VV EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). EVENING PRIMROSE OIL
352
PARKINSON' S DISEAS E
(EPO) IMPROVED PARKINSON'S-INDUCED TREMORS IN 55 PERCENT OF THOSE WHO TOOK THE
EQUIVALENT OF TWO TEASPOONS A DAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE OIL CONTAINS TRACES OF
THE AMINO ACID TRYPTOPHAN, WHICH BOOSTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF L-DOPA. (GROUND
EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS CONTAIN EVEN MORE.)
MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND AUTHOR OF NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS, SUGGESTS TAKING TWO GRAMS OF TRYPTOPHAN THREE TIMES A DAY IN
COMBINATION WITH L-DOPA FOR TREATING PARKINSON'S. UNFORTUNATELY, YOU CAN'T GET A
TRYPTOPHAN SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRAION BANNED IT SOME
YEARS AGO AFTER A BATCH TURNED OUT TO BE CONTAMINATED. WHILE YOU CAN STILL GET TRYPTOPHAN IN EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS, IT WOULD TAKE NEARLY A QUARTER-POUND OF SEEDS TO
PROVIDE TWO GRAMS OF TRYPTOPHAN.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS. I THINK TAKING A COUPLE OF
TEASPOONS OF EPO A DAY OR INCLUDING GROUND SEEDS IN YOUR BAKED GOODS MIGHT
BE HELPFUL.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS MORE WIDELY USED IN STROKE RECOVERY AND TO TREAT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, BUT I BELIEVE IT MAY ALSO HELP WITH
PARKINSON'S, BECAUSE IT IMPROVES BLOOD CIRCULATION THROUGH THE BRAIN, DELIVERING
MORE L-DOPA WHERE IT'S NEEDED. I SUGGEST TRYING
THREE CAPSULES A DAY, EACH CONTAINING 300 TO 500 MILLIGRAMS
OF A STANDARDIZED 50:1 GINKGO
EXTRACT WITH 25 PERCENT
FLAVONOIDS. (THIS INFORMATION WILL
BE ON THE LABEL.) JUST BE AWARE
THAT MORE THAN 240 MILLIGRAMS A
DAY MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS. IF YOU
EXPERIENCE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, TRY A LOWER DOSE.
V PASSIONFLOWER (PTISSIFLORA INCARNATA). TWO HERBALISTS WHOM I PARTICULARLY RESPECT,
DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE
HERBAL HANDBOOK, AND MICHAEL
TIERRA, RECOMMEND PASSIONFLOWER FOR TREATING PARKINSON'S
DISEASE. MANY OTHER HERBALISTS
DO, TOO. PASSIONFLOWER CONTAINS
PASSIONFLOWER
PASSIONFLOWER, WHICH IS MORE WIDELY USED IN
EUROPE THAN IN ITS HOMELAND, AMERICA, MAY
HELP COMBAT PARKINSONS DISEASE.
353
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TWO REPORTEDLY EFFECTIVE ANTI-PARKINSON'S COMPOUNDS—HARMINE AND HARMALINE
ALKALOIDS. IF I HAD PARKINSON'S, I WOULD TAKE 10 TO 30 DROPS THREE TIMES A DAY OF A
STANDARDIZED TINCTURE CONTAINING 0.7 PERCENT FLAVONOIDS. (AGAIN, YOU'LL FIND THIS
INFORMATION ON THE LABEL.)
V ST.-JOHN'S-WORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). IT'S A CURIOUS THING:
SMOKERS HAVE AN UNUSUALLY LOW RISK OF PARKINSON'S.
WHY? APPARENTLY IT'S BECAUSE NICOTINE INCREASES THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE
IN THE BRAIN. MEANWHILE, THE ENZYME MONOAMINE OXIDASE (MAO) DEPRESSES
DOPAMINE, SO IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT MEDICATIONS THAT INHIBIT MAO (MAO
INHIBITORS) WOULD BOOST DOPAMINE AND DECREASE PARKINSON'S RISK, JUST AS NICOTINE DOES.
MAO INHIBITORS ARE A MAJOR CLASS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS, AND ST.-
JOHN'S-WORT IS ONE REPORTED HERBAL MAO INHIBITOR. IF I HAD PARKINSON'S, I'D TRY A
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT TINCTURE STANDARDIZED TO 0.1 PERCENT HYPERICIN AND TAKE 20 TO 30
DROPS THREE TIMES A DAY. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU TAKE AN MAO INHIBITOR,
WHETHER PHARMACEUTICAL OR HERBAL, ON A REGULAR BASIS, THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF
INTERACTION WITH SOME FOODS AND MEDICATIONS. YOU SHOULD AVOID ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND SMOKED OR PICKLED FOODS, AS WELL AS COLD AND HAY FEVER REMEDIES, AMPHETAMINES, NARCOTICS, TRYPTOPHAN AND TYROSINE. YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE
ST.-JOHN'S-WORT IF YOU'RE PREGNANT, AND YOU SHOULD AVOID INTENSE SUN EXPOSURE
WHILE USING IT, SINCE THIS HERB CAN MAKE THE SKIN MORE SENSITIVE TO SUNLIGHT.
PNEUMONIA
T
HERE WE WERE IN OCTOBER OF 1995, THREE MUSICIANS FROM DIFFERENT MUSICAL TRADITIONS TRADING TUNES AT THE NAPO CAMP IN AMAZONIAN PERU.
MY SHAMAN FRIEND ANTONIO MONTERO PISCO WAS CHANTING HIS PERSONAL SONGS TO
THE SPIRITS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS. WHILE ANTONIO CHANTED, JOE MORENO, A MUSIC
THERAPIST FROM MARYVILLE UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, DEFTLY SCRIBBLED AWAY, TRANSCRIBING THE CHANTS INTO MUSICAL NOTATION.
MEANWHILE, YOURS TRULY, A BAD BUT ENTHUSIASTIC BLUEGRASS GUITARIST AND BASS
FIDDLE PLAYER, SAT THERE IN AWE OF BOTH OF THEM. THE YEAR BEFORE, WE HAD ASKED
ANTONIO TO TAPE RECORD HIS CHANTS TO SOME 30 MEDICINAL PLANTS, INCLUDING ONE
CALLED MUCURITA (PETIVERIA ALLIACEA), AN HERB THAT SMELLS LIKE ONION.
LATER, JOE AMAZED ANTONIO BY SINGING HIS CHANT BACK TO HIM. THEN ANTONIO
AND JOE SANG IT TOGETHER, WITH ANTONIO ACCOMPANYING THEM ON HIS SHACAPA, A
GRASSY FAN THAT WHEN SHAKEN, SOUNDS LIKE BRUSHES ON A DRUM. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
354
PNEUMONI A
MOMENTS THAT ONLY HAPPEN IN THE AMAZON AND KEEP ME GOING BACK FOR MORE.
I TELL THIS STORY BECAUSE THE PLANT MY FRIENDS SANG ABOUT IS ONE OF ANTONIO'S
MAINSTAY TREATMENTS FOR RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS. IF I DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA, AN
AMERICAN DOCTOR WOULD PROBABLY PRESCRIBE AN ANTIBIOTIC ON THE CHANCE THAT I
HAD A BACTERIAL LUNG INFECTION AND NOT A VIRAL ONE. BUT ANTONIO WOULD PRESCRIBE
MUCURITA, PROBABLY WITH SOME ONIONS AND GARLIC.
THE SULFIDE COMPOUNDS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AROMAS OF THESE THREE PLANTS
HAVE ANTISEPTIC, ANTIBIOTIC AND ANTIVIRAL PROPERTIES, AND THE BAD BREATH THEY
CAUSE IS A SIGN THAT THE SULFIDES GO RIGHT TO THE LUNGS, WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED.
DEEP-DOWN TROUBLE
PNEUMONIA IS A GENERAL TERM MEANING ANY INFECTION DEEP IN THE LUNGS.
(BRONCHITIS, BY CONTRAST, IS AN INFECTION IN THE GATEWAY TO THE LUNGS, THE
BRONCHIAL TUBES.)
AMONG INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN THE UNITED STATES, PNEUMONIA IS CURRENTLY
THE LEADING KILLER AND THE NATION'S FIFTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH OVERALL, CLAIMING
MORE LIVES EACH YEAR THAN AIDS. MOST OF THOSE DEATHS COME FROM TWO SOURCES:
INFLUENZA, WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO PNEUMONIA, ESPECIALLY IN THE ELDERLY, AND
HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS IN THOSE WHO ARE ILL FROM OTHER CAUSES BUT DEVELOP
PNEUMONIA BECAUSE THEIR WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS CAN'T FIGHT IT OFF. BACTERIA
THAT CAUSE PNEUMONIA ARE SO ABUNDANT IN HOSPITALS THAT ACCORDING TO CONSUMER'S REPORT ON HEALTH, AN ESTIMATED 4 PERCENT OF ALL PATIENTS DEVELOP THE INFECTION, PROBABLY AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR HOSPITAL STAY.
SOME 40,000 OLDER AMERICANS DIE OF PNEUMONIA EVERY YEAR, SO IT'S NOTHING
TO FOOL AROUND WITH. OTHERS AT RISK INCLUDE THOSE WITH ALCOHOLISM, CANCER, CIRRHOSIS, HEART OR KIDNEY FAILURE, SICKLE-CELL DISEASE, SPLEEN DISORDERS OR RECENT
ORGAN TRANSPLANTS.
PNEUMONIA MAY BE CAUSED BY BACTERIA, FUNGI, PROTOZOA OR VIRUSES, HENCE IT
IS INAPPROPRIATE TO SELF-DIAGNOSE, MUCH LESS SELF-MEDICATE. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE
SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAIN, COUGHING, DIFFICULTY BREATHING, FEVER AND CHILLS
WITH SHAKING. IF YOU DEVELOP PNEUMONIA SYMPTOMS, YOU MUST SEE YOUR DOCTOR
PROMPTLY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PNEUMONIA
IN ADDITION TO TAKING WHATEVER YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES, YOU MIGHT TRY SOME
HERBAL AND NUTRITIONAL ALTERNATIVES, WITH YOUR DOCTOR'S PERMISSION.
V%> ASTRAGALUS (ASTRAGALUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS HUANG QI,
ASTRAGALUS IS AN IMMUNE BOOSTER AND THE ASIAN ANSWER TO OUR OWN ECHINACEA.
THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO USE BOTH.
355
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
V> BAIKAL SKULLCAP (SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS). EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM
CHINA SHOW THAT THE ROOT OF THIS PLANT, WHICH IS CLOSE KIN TO OUR OWN SKULLCAP, HAS
BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION. IT INHIBITS FLU VIRUSES AND SEVERAL PNEUMONIA-CAUSING FUNGI. CHINESE PHYSICIANS SOMETIMES INJECT A MIXTURE OF BAIKAL
SKULLCAP, GOLDTHREAD AND AMUR CORK TREE EXTRACTS TO TREAT PNEUMONIA, FLU AND OTHER
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS.
I'M NOT RECOMMENDING INJECTIONS. BUT IF I HAD PNEUMONIA, I WOULD TAKE
MIXTURES OF BAIKAL SKULLCAP AND OUR OWN GOLDEN ANTIBIOTIC HERBS: BARBERRY,
GOLDTHREAD, GOLDENSEAL, OREGON GRAPE AND/OR YELLOWROOT. WHILE BAIKAL, THE
ASIAN FORM OF SKULLCAP, IS HARD TO FIND IN MANY HERB SHOPS AND HEALTH FOOD
STORES, IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN IN CHINESE HERB STORES.
VV DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE
DEMONSTRATED DANDELION'S EFIFECTIVENESS AGAINST PNEUMONIA, BRONCHITIS AND UPPER
RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D.
I SUGGEST COOKING THE GREENS AND ROOTS. REMEMBER TO DRINK THE POTLIKKER,
THE JUICE THAT REMAINS AFTER THE GREENS ARE COOKED. ALTHOUGH I CAN FIND DANDELION 12 MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN MARYLAND, YOU MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH
HERB ALL YEAR LONG WHERE YOU LIVE. YOU CAN ALSO DRINK TEA MADE FROM THE DRIED
HERB, OR YOU CAN TAKE CAPSULES.
VV ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ANTIBIOTICS MAY BE INDICATED IN BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA, BUT IN ANY TYPE OF INFECTIOUS PNEUMONIA—
BACTERIAL, VIRAL OR FUNGAL—I'D RECOMMEND HERBS THAT ENHANCE THE IMMUNE
SYSTEM. ECHINACEA IS ONE OF THE BEST. A WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES SHOWS THAT
IT HELPS THE BODY FIGHT OFF ALL SORTS OF BACTERIA, VIRUSES AND FUNGI.
ECHINACEA PREPARATIONS—TEAS AND TINCTURES—HAVE BECOME VERY POPULAR
HEALTH FOOD STORE PRODUCTS FOR TREATING COLDS, FLU AND BRONCHITIS. IF I HAD PNEUMONIA, I'D TAKE A TEASPOON OR TWO OF TINCTURE IN JUICE OR TEA SEVERAL TIMES A
DAY. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). MARY BOVE, N.D., CHAIR OF THE BOTANICAL
MEDICINE DEPARTMENT AT BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE AND ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST
HIGHLY TRAINED HERBALISTS, DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT MONTHS
PREGNANT. HER PHYSICIAN, PREDICTABLY, PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS, BUT SHE REJECTED
THEM IN FAVOR OF SIX TO TEN CLOVES OF CHOPPED GARLIC A DAY, ALONG WITH ECHINACEA.
SHE BEGAN FEELING BETTER AFTER TWO DAYS AND WAS CURED IN TWO WEEKS.
NOT SURPRISINGLY, DR. BOVE PRESCRIBES THIS TREATMENT FOR PNEUMONIA IN HER
OWN NATUROPATHIC PRACTICE. OTHER NATUROPATHS DO, TOO. JILL STANSBURY, N.D., A
FACULTY MEMBER AT THE NATIONAL COLLEGE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE IN PORTLAND,
OREGON, URGES HER STUDENTS TO USE GARLIC TO TREAT RESPIRATORY AND DIGESTIVE TRACT
356
PNEUMONI A
INFECTIONS. IN FACT, GARLIC IS ABOUT THE CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO AN HERBAL
WONDER DRUG FOR TREATING INFECTIONS.
VV GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). AMERICAN INDIANS USED GOLDENSEAL TO TREAT ALL MANNER OF INFECTIONS, AND WHITE SETTLERS ADOPTED IT BECAUSE
IT WORKS. IT TURNS OUT THAT GOLDENSEAL HAS TWO BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIMICROBIAL
CONSTITUENTS, HYDRASTINE AND BERBERINE.
TO USE THIS HERB, BUY A TINCTURE AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE AND FOLLOW THE
PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. OTHER HERBS WITH SIMILAR ACTION INCLUDE BARBERRY,
GOLDTHREAD, OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT. THEY ARE ALL FINE USED ON THEIR OWN,
BUT I'D ALSO SUGGEST TRYING A MIXTURE. AND I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE USE OF GOLDENSEAL AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR TREATING PNEUMONIA.
VV HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA JAPONICA). CHINESE HERBALISTS SUGGEST
HONEYSUCKLE FOR TREATING PNEUMONIA, BRONCHITIS, FLU AND COLDS, BUT THEY USE
THE FLOWERS IN A PREPARATION TAKEN BY INJECTION. I DON'T RECOMMEND INJECTING
THIS HERB, BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT ORALLY. FLOWER EXTRACTS ARE STRONGLY ACTIVE AGAINST
MANY KINDS OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES, AND I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO USE IT MYSELF.
IN SUMMER, YOU CAN BOIL A CUP OF FLOWERS IN A CUP OF WATER, THEN STRAIN THE
TEA BEFORE DRINKING IT. IN WINTER, YOU CAN STRIP OFF THE OLD, DRIED LEAVES FROM A
VINE AND USE THEM TO MAKE A TEA. EVEN BETTER, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HONEYSUCKLE IN
COMBINATION WITH FORSYTHIA. FORSYTHIA ALSO CONTAINS SEVERAL POTENT ANTISEPTIC
AND SOME ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS. IN WINTER, I SOMETIMES MAKE A TEA WITH BARE
TWIGS OF HONEYSUCKLE AND FORSYTHIA AND SWEETEN IT WITH LEMONADE POWDER.
VV ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONIONS ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO GARLIC, WITH
MANY SIMILAR SULFUR-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS. MOST HERBALISTS CONSIDER GARLIC
MORE EFFECTIVE, BUT ONIONS ARE CERTAINLY BENEFICIAL. I RECOMMEND ONION SOUP
FOR RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING PNEUMONIA. AND IF YOU PREFER CHICKEN
SOUP FOR TREATING COLDS, FLU, BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA, BE SURE TO ADD SOME
ONIONS AND GARLIC TO THE RECIPE.
V OSHA (LOMATIUM DISSECTUM). AMERICAN INDIANS USED THIS HERB,
RATHER SUGGESTIVE OF A PARSLEY OR DILL PLANT, TO TREAT ALL MANNER OF RESPIRATORY
AILMENTS: PNEUMONIA, INFLUENZA, COLDS, BRONCHITIS, TUBERCULOSIS, HAY FEVER AND
ASTHMA. SOME NATUROPATHS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR CLINICAL TRIALS TO SEE IF IT
MIGHT HELP TREAT PNEUMONIA, WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME. IN THE
MEANTIME, YOU COULD TRY CHEWING ON THE ROOT AS AMERICAN INDIANS DO.
V SUNDEW (DROSERA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). A MAJOR CONSTITUENT OF
SUNDEW, PLUMBAGIN, INHIBITS SEVERAL OF THE BACTERIA THAT CAN CAUSE PNEUMONIA. THE HERB ALSO CONTAINS A COUGH SUPPRESSANT.
COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT
ABOUT HERBS, RECOMMENDS TAKING ABOUT TWO TEASPOONS OF TINCTURE A DAY TO TREAT
RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING PNEUMONIA.
357
POISON IVY, POISON OAK
AND POISON SUMAC
I
'M ABOUT TO CONFESS TO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WENT INTO BOTANY. ONE
TIME, LONG AGO WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS PLAYING IN A VACANT LOT ON
MORDECAI DRIVE IN RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, AND UNKNOWINGLY USED POISON IVY
AS TOILET PAPER. I GOT A BAD RASH IN A BAD SPOT, AND IT TORMENTED ME FOR MORE
THAN A WEEK. TO AVOID A REPEAT OF THAT EXPERIENCE, I FIGURED IT WOULD SERVE ME
WELL TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE POISONOUS PLANTS. WELL, ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER,
AND I WOUND UP AS A BOTANIST.
ALTHOUGH I NEVER REPEATED THAT PARTICULAR MISTAKE, I STILL HAVE A FAIRLY
CLOSE, ALTHOUGH MOSTLY RASH-FREE, RELATIONSHIP WITH POISON IVY. A BIG PATCH OF
IT HAS PRACTICALLY SURROUNDED THE MAILBOX AT MY HERBAL VINEYARD. IF I DON'T THIN
IT PERIODICALLY, IT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR MY NEIGHBOR, WHOSE MAILBOX IS NEXT
TO MINE AND WHO IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO THE PLANT.
SO WHEN THE POISON IVY GROWS INTO A SIZABLE CLUMP, I GO OUT AND GRAB A
BUNCH OF JEWELWEED, A SUCCULENT, ORANGE-FLOWERED ANNUAL THAT GROWS IN MOIST
MEADOWS ON MY LAND. I CRUSH A BALL OF IT IN MY HANDS AND RUB MYSELF DOWN WITH
ITS JUICE. THEN I SPEND 15 OR 20 MINUTES PULLING UP THE POISON IVY, RUBBING MYSELF WITH JEWELWEED JUICE PERIODICALLY. THE RESULT? MY NEIGHBOR IS HAPPY, AND
I NEVER GET A POISON IVY RASH.
MOST BUT NOT ALL AMERICANS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE IRRITATING OIL, URASHIOL,
THAT'S FOUND IN PLANTS LIKE POISON IVY, POISON OAK AND POISON SUMAC. THOSE WHO
ARE SENSITIVE DEVELOP A NASTY, PERSISTENT, BLISTERING RASH AFTER CONTACT. IT'S NOT
CLEAR WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE RELATIVELY OR EVEN COMPLETELY IMMUNE TO THESE OILS.
WHILE IT'S ESTIMATED THAT SOME 350,000 AMERICANS EXPERIENCE AN EPISODE OF
POISON-PLANT RASH EACH YEAR, I SUSPECT THAT FIGURE IS LOW. MANY PEOPLE NEVER
CALL THEIR DOCTORS, SO IT'S HARD TO GET A DECENT ESTIMATE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR POISON IVY, POISON OAK
ANA POISON SUMAC
THE TRADITIONAL DRUGSTORE REMEDY FOR REACTIONS TO POISONOUS PLANTS IS
CALAMINE LOTION. IT COOLS THE HOT RASH AND RELIEVES SOME OF THE ITCHING. BUT PERSONALLY, I THINK SEVERAL HERBAL APPROACHES WORK EVEN BETTER.
V*^. JEWELWEED (IMPATIENS CAPENSIS)* I'M NOT THE ONLY FAN OF JEWELWEED
358
POISO N IVY, POISO N OA K AND POISO N SUMAC
FOR PREVENTING THE UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS THAT DEVELOP FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO POISONOUS PLANTS. INCREASINGLY, AT WORKSHOPS WHERE I MENTION IT, PARTICIPANTS CHIME
IN WITH THEIR OWN JEWELWEED STORIES. I'M WELL AWARE THAT THESE STORIES, AND MY OWN,
ARE WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL ANECDOTES AND THEREFORE ARE OPEN TO SCIENTIFIC SKEPTICISM.
BUT SEEING IS BELIEVING. PILE UP ALL THE ANECDOTES, AND THEY MAKE A PRETTY CONVINCING CASE.
OF COURSE, EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE IS EVEN BETTER. THAT'S WHY, WHENEVER I
TEACH A THREE-DAY CLASS ON MEDICINAL HERBS, I TREAT MY STUDENTS TO A DRAMATIC
LITTLE DEMONSTRATION. I FIND A POISONOUS PLANT, USUALLY POISON IVY. I APPLY ITS
JUICE TO THE SENSITIVE UNDERSIDES OF BOTH OF MY WRISTS. A MINUTE OR TWO LATER, I
WIPE ONE WRIST WITH A BALL OF CRUSHED JEWELWEED LEAVES AND STEMS. THREE DAYS
LATER, THE WRIST THAT I DIDN'T TREAT WITH JEWELWEED SHOWS THE TYPICAL ITCHY, BLISTERY POISON-PLANT RASH. THE WRIST RUBBED WITH JEWELWEED INVARIABLY SHOWS
MUCH LESS OF A RASH, AND SOMETIMES NONE AT ALL.
MY FRIEND ROBERT ROSEN, PH.D., A CHEMIST AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY IN NEW
BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY, IS A WHIZ AT ISOLATING CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES FROM PLANTS.
HE MAY HAVE COME UP WITH AN EXPLANATION FOR JEWELWEED'S EFFECTIVENESS.
URUSHIOL DOES ITS DIRTY WORK BY BINDING TO SKIN CELLS AND TRIGGERING THE RASHPRODUCING IRRITATION. A MERE ONE-BILLIONTH OF A GRAM OF URUSHIOL IS ENOUGH TO
AFFECT THOSE WHO ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE.
DR. ROSEN HAS IDENTIFIED THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN JEWELWEED AS A CHEMICAL
CALLED LAWSONE. THIS SUBSTANCE BINDS TO THE SAME MOLECULAR SITES ON THE SKIN
AS URUSHIOL. IF APPLIED QUICKLY AFTER CONTACT WITH A POISON PLANT, LAWSONE BEATS
THE URUSHIOL TO THOSE SITES, IN EFFECT LOCKING IT OUT. THE SIMPLE RESULT IS THAT YOU
DON'T GET THE RASH.
THE GREATEST CONCENTRATIONS OF LAWSONE ARE NOT NECESSARILY FOUND IN JEWELWEED LEAVES. ALTHOUGH THE LEAVES HAVE SOME LAWSONE, THERE MAY BE MORE IN
THE REDDISH PROTUBERANCES THAT RESEMBLE LITTLE PROP-ROOTS EXTENDING OUT FROM
THE LOWER STEM NEAR GROUND LEVEL. APPLY THE JUICE FROM THE CRUSHED RED KNOBS,
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY GET BETTER PROTECTION.
W ALOE (ALOE VERA). THE GEL INSIDE LEATHERY ALOE LEAVES HAS BEEN SHOWN
AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HELP HEAL BURNS AND OTHER SKIN PROBLEMS. HERBALISTS ALSO
RECOMMEND USING IT TO HELP SOOTHE AND HEAL THE RASH THAT FOLLOWS CONTACT WITH
POISONOUS PLANTS. IF I GOT A RASH THAT I SUSPECTED CAME FROM A POISONOUS PLANT, I'D
SLIT OPEN A FRESH ALOE LEAF AND WIPE THE GEL ON THE AFFECTED AREA.
W PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE PRESTIGIOUS NEW ENGLAND
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE REPORTED THAT POULTICES MADE FROM PLANTAIN LEAVES CAN HELP
CONTROL THE ITCHING OF POISON IVY.
^ ^ SOAPWORT (SAPONARIA OFFICINALIS). DOCTORS USED TO RECOMMEND THAT
359
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
AS SOON AS YOU REALIZE YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO A POISONOUS PLANT, YOU SHOULD VIGOROUSLY WASH THE AREA WITH SOAP AND WATER TO GET RID OF THE URUSHIOL. IF YOU'RE OUTDOORS WITHOUT READY ACCESS TO SOAP, YOU CAN TRY THE JUICE OF THE SOAPWORT PLANT TO
WASH YOURSELF.
I'M SINGLING OUT SOAPWORT HERE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE "SOAPY" PLANTS
THAT CONTAIN COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SAPONINS MIGHT WORK BETTER THAN SOAP AND
WATER IN MINIMIZING THE IRRITATING EFFECTS OF URUSHIOL. OTHER PLANTS HIGH IN
SAPONINS INCLUDE HORSE CHESTNUT, LICORICE, SENECA SNAKEROOT, SOAPBARK, ROSE
LEAVES AND GOTU KOLA. (REMEMBER, I'M CALLING FOR EXTERNAL USE OF THESE PLANTS.
HORSE CHESTNUT AND SENECA SNAKEROOT ARE INEDIBLE.)
PREGNANCY ANA DELIVERY
I
'M VERY PLEASED WITH MY PART-CHEROKEE, PART-REDNECK GRANDSON, JOHN
JAMES DUKE, BORN AUGUST 13, 1993.1 HAVE ENJOYED INTRODUCING HIM TO
THE PLEASURES AND PERILS OF MY RASPBERRY PATCH, A TANGLE OF VINES WHERE THE
SWEET BERRIES BECKON AND THE THORNS THREATEN.
THE WAY WE WORK IT, I PULL OUT A FRUIT-BEARING BRANCH WITH GLOVED HANDS,
AND HE PICKS OFF THE RIPE, SWEET BERRIES. WHENEVER WE DO THIS, I CAN'T HELP BUT
CONSIDER THE RASPBERRY'S POPULARITY AMONG HERBALISTS FOR CALMING THE UTERUS
DURING PREGNANCY AND FACILITATING DELIVERY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PREGNANCY ANA DELIVERY
RASPBERRY IS PROBABLY THE BEST-KNOWN HERB FOR PREGNANCY, BUT IT'S JUST ONE
OF MANY THAT ARE USEFUL.
BEFORE I DISCUSS THE INDIVIDUAL HERBS, I SHOULD MENTION THAT THESE DAYS OBSTETRICIANS INSIST THAT THEIR PATIENTS LET THEM KNOW ABOUT ANY OVER-THE-COUNTER
MEDICATIONS, VITAMINS, SUPPLEMENTS OR HERBS THAT THEY TAKE. THIS IS A GOOD RULE
TO FOLLOW. THE HERBS I'M LISTING HERE HAVE CENTURIES OF SAFE USE BEHIND THEM,
BUT EVERY WOMAN—AND EVERY PREGNANCY—IS DIFFERENT. PLEASE LET YOUR DOCTOR
KNOW ABOUT ANY HERBS THAT YOU WANT TO TRY.
AND DO PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE PROPERTIES THAT THESE HERBS HAVE. SOME
HELP SETTLE AN IRRITABLE UTERUS AND HELP MAKE PREGNANCY MORE COMFORTABLE.
OTHERS CAN HASTEN DELIVERY.
W%. PARTRIDGE BERRY (MITCHELLA REP ENS). AROUND 1860, IN AN OLD, LONGGONE MEDICAL JOURNAL CALLED BOTANIC PHYSICIAN, A DR. SMITH HEAPED PRAISE ON PARTRIDGE BERRY: "THIS IS AN INVALUABLE PLANT FOR CHILD-BEARING WOMEN. I FIRST OBTAINED
360
PREGNANC Y AND DELIVERY
KNOWLEDGE OF ITS USE FROM A TRIBE OF INDIANS IN THE WEST PART OF NEW YORK. THE
SQUAWS DRANK IT IN DECOCTION FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS PREVIOUS TO AND DURING DELIVERY, AND IT WAS THE USE OF IT THAT RENDERED THAT GENERALLY DREADED EVENT SO REMARKABLY SAFE AND EASY WITH THEM."
PARTRIDGE BERRY REMAINS POPULAR TODAY, PARTICULARLY WITH WOMEN HERBALISTS. JEANNINE PARVATI, AUTHOR OF A FASCINATING BOOK, HYGIEIA: A WOMAN'S
HERBAL, CALLS PARTRIDGE BERRY HER FAVORITE PREGNANCY HERB. SHE OFTEN COMBINES
IT WITH RASPBERRY, BLACK HAW, BLESSED THISTLE, LICORICE OR SARSAPARILLA. PARVATI
SUGGESTS USING THE HERB JUST BEFORE DELIVERY.
V W RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). I'M SOLD ON RASPBERRY FOR COMPLAINTS OF
PREGNANCY. ONE STUDY IDENTIFIED A CHEMICAL IN RASPBERRY THAT RELAXES THE UTERUS.
FOR CENTURIES, WOMEN PRONE TO MISCARRIAGE
HAVE BEEN URGED TO DRINK RASPBERRY LEAF
TEA THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY TO HELP
THEM CARRY THE BABY TO TERM. THE HERB IS
ALSO REPORTEDLY USEFUL IN PREVENTING MANY
OF THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY, INCLUDING
MORNING SICKNESS.
CHANCES ARE THAT THIS HERB'S CLOSE
BOTANICAL RELATIVES, BLACKBERRIES, DEWBERRIES AND WINEBERRIES, WOULD OFFER SIMILAR BENEFITS.
VV BLACK HAW (VIBURNUM PRUNIFOLIUM). ALSO CALLED CRAMPBARK, THIS
HERB WAS RECOGNIZED IN MOST NINETEENTHCENTURY PHARMACY REFERENCE BOOKS AS A
TREATMENT FOR PAINFUL MENSTRUAL CRAMPS
AND THREATENED MISCARRIAGE. TODAY HERBALISTS CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND IT FOR THOSE CONDITIONS AS WELL AS TO TREAT THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY. IT SEEMS TO SOOTHE THE UTERUS.
VV BLUE COHOSH (CAULOPHYLLUM THALICTROIDES). SEVERAL YEARS AGO, A
CHEMIST FRIEND CAME OUT TO HERBAL VINEYARD WITH HIS WIFE, A NURSE, WHO WAS CLOSE
TO FULL TERM AND OBVIOUSLY READY TO BEAR FRUIT. SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTED TO GET IT
OVER WITH AND ASKED WHAT I RECOMMENDED. I SAID THAT AS A BOTANIST I COULD NOT RECOMMEND, BUT IF I WERE IN HER SHOES AND TRYING TO SPEED UP DELIVERY, I MIGHT TRY
BLUE COHOSH.
AMERICAN INDIANS USED BLUE COHOSH TO INDUCE LABOR, AND WITH GOOD REASON.
THIS PLANT CONTAINS THE COMPOUND CAULOSAPONIN, A POWERFUL STIMULATOR OF
UTERINE CONTRACTIONS.
RASPBERRY
RASPBERRY, A MEMBER OF THE ROSE
FAMILY, WAS RECOMMENDED BY
SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY HERBALISTS
FOR PREGNANCY COMPLAINTS.
361
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE A FEW ANECDOTES SUGGESTING THAT GETTING AN OVERDOSE OF BLUE COHOSH MIGHT BE HARMFUL BEFORE TERM, POSSIBLY EVEN
CAUSING LOSS OF THE BABY. SO I WOULD STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING THIS HERB UNLESS YOU DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
BUT REMEMBER MY OFT-REPEATED LAMENT. IF THERE'S AN ANECDOTE ABOUT SOME
HARM CAUSED BY AN HERB, THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT LATCHES ONTO IT AS A FACT.
BUT IF THERE ARE 100 ANECDOTAL ACCOUNTS OF BENEFITS FROM AN HERB, THOSE ANECDOTES REMAIN "JUST ANECDOTES."
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT IF MY OWN DAUGHTER WERE BLUE ABOUT A SLOW DELIVERY AND WANTED TO GET ON WITH IT, I WOULD SUGGEST USING BLUE COHOSH TINCTURE.
MAINE HERBALIST DEB SOULE, FOUNDER OF AVENA BOTANICALS AND AUTHOR OF AN
INTERESTING AND WELL-REASONED FEMINIST HERBAL, THE ROOTS OF HEALINGS SUGGESTS
USING 20 TO 30 DROPS OF BLUE COHOSH TINCTURE TO INDUCE LABOR. HAVING SPENT
SOME TIME WITH HER IN THE NORTH WOODS, I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR SOULE AND HER
WOMEN'S HEALTH HERBAL FORMULAS.
W JUTE (CORCHORUS OLITORIUS). JUTE IS ONE OF THE BEST NATURAL SOURCES OF
FOLATE (32 PARTS PER MILLION ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS). FOLATE (THE NATURALLY OCCURRING
FORM OF FOLIC ACID) IS THE B VITAMIN THAT HELPS PREVENT THE OFTEN-FATAL SPINAL MALFORMATION KNOWN AS SPINA BIFIDA. (FOR JUST THIS REASON, AN OBSTETRICIAN WILL USUALLY RECOMMEND A FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENT TO PREGNANT WOMEN.) LENTILS ALSO CONTAIN
FAIRLY HIGH LEVELS OF FOLATE.
W PARSLEY (PETROSELINUM CTISPWN). PARSLEY CONTAINS THE COMPOUND APIOLE,
A UTERINE STIMULANT THAT WAS ONCE USED TO INDUCE ABORTIONS. IN RUSSIA, A PRODUCT
CALLED SUPETIN THAT CONTAINS MOSDY PARSLEY JUICE IS USED TO STIMULATE UTERINE CONTRACTIONS DURING LABOR.
THE HERB CONTAINS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF APIOLE THAT THERE'S LITDE NEED FOR
CONCERN IF YOU USE CULINARY AMOUNTS. I EVEN ENCOURAGE EATING PARSLEY FOR ITS
FOLATE. YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID EATING LARGE AMOUNTS OF PARSLEY, SUCH AS YOU
MIGHT FIND IN TABBOULEH SALAD, WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT, HOWEVER. AND DO AVOID
USING PARSLEY FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES UNLESS YOU'RE ABOUT TO DELIVER AND ARE NOT
CONCERNED ABOUT HASTENING THINGS ALONG. THERE'S AN UNCONFIRMED RUMOR FROM
GERMANY THAT PARSLEY CONTAINS PROGESTERONE.
VV ST.-JOHNVWORT (HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). SOULE SUGGESTS THAT THIS
HERB'S BLOOD-RED OIL IS "A MUST TO HAVE AT ALL BIRTHS." THE OIL IS VERY SOOTHING WHEN
RUBBED ON THE PERINEUM, THE TEAR-PRONE AREA BETWEEN THE VAGINA AND ANUS, DURING
LABOR. FOLLOWING DELIVERY, IT'S EVEN MORE VALUABLE. ITS SOOTHING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
ACTION EASES BURNING AND SWELLING AND SPEEDS THE HEALING OF PERINEAL TEARS.
V ^ SHEPHERD'S PURSE (CAPSELLA BURSA-PASTORIS). SOULE SUGGESTS TAKING
40 TO 60 DROPS OF TINCTURE SOON AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO HELP STOP BLEEDING. THIS ADVICE
362
PREGNANC Y AN D DELIVERY
MAKES GOOD SENSE, AS THE HERB'S ABILITY TO CONSTRICT BLOOD VESSELS HAS BEEN
DOCUMENTED SCIENTIFICALLY.
W SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA). BECAUSE IT'S SO RICH IN FOLATE, SPINACH
RANKS SECOND HIGHEST IN MY DATABASE AMONG PLANTS THAT MIGHT HELP PREVENT SPINA
BIFIDA AND OTHER RELATED DEFECTS. SPINACH IS ALSO RELATIVELY HIGH IN ZINC. WHEN
WOMEN ARE DEFICIENT IN ZINC, THEY EXPERIENCE BIRTHING DIFFICULTIES AND SLOWER
WOUND HEALING. NONVEGETARIANS GET MOST OF THEIR ZINC FROM MEAT, SO IF YOU'RE A VEGETARIAN, BE SURE TO EAT SPINACH, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PREGNANT.
YOU COULD ALSO MAKE A SOUP THAT INCLUDES SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING INGREDIENTS: SPINACH, ENDIVE, ASPARAGUS, PARSLEY, OKRA, PIGWEED AND CABBAGE.
AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD WITH YOUR SOUP, SINCE YOU CAN
GET TWICE AS MUCH FOLATE FROM WHOLE-WHEAT AS FROM WHITE BREAD.
V HERBA L FORMULAS. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF SOULE'S SENSIBLE FORMULAS FOR PREGNANCY, BASED ON HER 12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH BACKWOODS
MEDICINE IN MAINE.
TO PREVENT MISCARRIAGE, SHE RECOMMENDS TWO PARTS BLACK HAW, ONE PART
FALSE-UNICORN ROOT AND ONE PART WILD YAM. MIX THEIR TINCTURES USING 20 DROPS
OF BLACK HAW AND 10 DROPS EACH OF FALSE-UNICORN ROOT AND WILD YAM, SHE SUGGESTS. DRINK THIS MIXTURE TWO TO FOUR TIMES A DAY AS A GENERAL PREVENTIVE. IF
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH SPOTTING, TAKE THE FORMULA EVERY TWO HOURS UNTIL SPOTTING STOPS.
FOR A TEA TO PREVENT MISCARRIAGE, SOULE SUGGESTS TWO TABLESPOONS OF LEMON
BALM (ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA) AND PARTRIDGE BERRY LEAVES AND ONE TABLESPOON
EACH OF STINGING NETDE LEAVES, OATSTRAW AND RASPBERRY LEAVES STEEPED IN A QUART
OF BOILING WATER. DRINK UP TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
FOR DELIVERY, SHE RECOMMENDS A TEA MADE WITH TWO PARTS EACH OF HOLY BASIL,
LAVENDER AND LEMON BALM AND ONE PART EACH OF BORAGE AND PANSY FLOWERS. ALTERNATE THIS WITH RASPBERRY LEAF TEA.
FOR POSTPARTUM SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY AFTER CESAREAN SECTIONS, SOULE RECOMMENDS A TINCTURE OF THREE PARTS BUPLEURUM, TWO PARTS DANDELION ROOT AND ONE
PART EACH OF ASTRAGALUS, BLESSED THISTLE AND WILD YAM.
TO HELP REPAIR PERINEAL TEARS, SHE SUGGESTS HERBAL SITZ BATHS WITH CALENDULA, YARROW FLOWERS AND COMFREY LEAVES ADDED TO THE WATER.
BECAUSE I KNOW SOULE AND HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR HER HERBAL
WISDOM, I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO SUGGEST HER BOOKS AND THESE FORMULAS TO MY
DAUGHTER, WERE SHE IN A BIRTHING MODE. THEY ALL SEEM LIKE SAFE AND SOUND FORMULAS TO ME.
363
PREMENSTRUAL SYN I ROME
I
RECENTLY READ ABOUT A BUMPER STICKER THAT SAID: "WARNING: I HAVE PMS
AND I HAVE A GUN." MAYBE THE WOMAN DRIVING THE CAR SHOULD TAKE A BEAD
ON THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), WHICH HAS TRIED MIGHTY HARD OVER
THE YEARS TO DISCOURAGE THE USE OF EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO) FOR TREATING THE
IRRITABILITY AND OTHER SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS).
FM A BOTANIST, NOT A DOCTOR, SO I'M LEERY OF PRESCRIBING MEDICINE, ESPECIALLY IN THE REALM OF WOMEN'S HEALTH. BUT FROM EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT PRIMROSE OIL, I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY DAUGHTER, OR ANY OTHER WOMAN, TO TRY EPO. I
HAVE ALSO TAUGHT MANY WOMEN WHO HAVE PMS TO GATHER THIS AMERICAN INDIAN
FOOD PLANT AND MAKE A CEREAL CONTAINING EPO OUT OF THE SEEDS.
PMS DESCRIBES A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS THAT CAN OCCUR AS A WOMAN
APPROACHES MENSTRUATION: ANXIETY, BLOATING, BREAST TENDERNESS, IRRITABILITY,
MOODINESS AND WEIGHT GAIN. MOST AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS ARE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF FEMALE SEX HORMONES, ESTROGEN AND
PROGESTERONE, THAT PRECEDE MENSTRUATION.
THE HIGHER THE ESTROGEN LEVEL, SCIENTISTS SAY, THE GREATER THE RISK OF PMS.
ESTIMATES VARY, BUT SOME 25 TO 50 PERCENT OF MENSTRUATING WOMEN SUFFER SOME
DEGREE OF PMS, WITH 8 TO 15 PERCENT EXPERIENCING SEVERE SYMPTOMS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME
FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF HERBS, INCLUDING EVENING PRIMROSE,
THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS.
V \ V CHASTEBERRY {VUEX AGNUS-CASTUS). THE SMALL FRUITS OF THE CHASTE TREE
HAVE BEEN USED FOR MENSTRUAL DISORDERS SINCE GRECO-ROMAN TIMES.
RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT CHASTEBERRY HELPS RELIEVE PMS BECAUSE OF ITS
EFFECTS ON FEMALE SEX HORMONES. IT HELPS BALANCE HORMONES PRODUCED DURING
WOMEN'S MONTHLY CYCLES, INCREASING PRODUCTION OF LUTEINIZING HORMONE AND INHIBITING THE RELEASE OF FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE. THIS LEADS TO A SHIFT IN THE ESTROGEN-PROGESTERONE RATIO, RESULTING IN LESS ESTROGEN TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE PMS.
THE ONLY CAVEAT IS THAT WOMEN WHO HAVE PMS WITH SIGNIFICANT DEPRESSION
SHOULD PROBABLY STEER CLEAR OF CHASTEBERRY. SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT PMS
WITH DEPRESSION IS CAUSED BY EXCESS PROGESTERONE, AND CHASTEBERRY IS SAID TO
RAISE PROGESTERONE LEVELS.
FOR MOST WOMEN, THOUGH, CHASTEBERRY WORKS. IN ONE YEAR-LONG STUDY, WOMEN
WITH PMS TOOK EITHER 175 MILLIGRAMS A DAY OF CHASTEBERRY EXTRACT OR 200 MILLIGRAMS
A DAY OF VITAMIN B6, A FREQUENTLY TOUTED SUPPLEMENT THAT IS SAID TO QUELL PMS.
364
PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME
CHASTEBERRY PROVED CLEARLY SUPERIOR TO THE B6-
AT LEAST ONE CHASTEBERRY PRODUCT IS APPROVED IN GERMANY FOR USE AS A TREATMENT FOR PMS, MENSTRUAL COMPLAINTS AND BREAST TENDERNESS. YOU CAN BUY BOTH
THE HERB ITSELF AND HERBAL TINCTURES IN MANY STORES THAT CARRY HERBAL PRODUCTS.
W%, CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED
HERBS IN CHINESE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE, CHINESE ANGELICA, OR DANG-QUCU, IS USED
PRIMARILY AS A WOMEN'S TONIC TO TREAT PMS AND MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. MANY WOMEN
TAKE TWO CAPSULES TWICE A DAY TO PREVENT PMS. (YOU SHOULD NOT
USE CHINESE ANGELICA IF YOU ARE PREGNANT.)
W * . EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS).
FOR CENTURIES, AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN HAVE BEEN
CHEWING THE SEEDS OF THE EVENING PRIMROSE FOR PREMENSTRUAL AND MENSTRUAL COMPLAINTS. AND EPO IS AN APPROVED PMS TREATMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN.
I'M NOT THE ONLY HERB LOVER WHO TOUTS EJPO FOR
PMS. THE WORD IS GETTING OUT. ON MY LAST PHARMACY ECOTOUR TO COSTA RICA, I OVERHEARD A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO WOMEN PHARMACISTS WHO
DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS WITHIN EARSHOT. ONE SAID
SHE TOOK ONE EPO CAPSULE A DAY ALL MONTH UNTIL
SHE FELT HER PMS COMING ON, THEN UPPED HER INTAKE TO FOUR CAPSULES A DAY UNTIL HER PERIOD WAS
OVER. SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN DOING THIS FOR SEVERAL
YEARS AND HAD PERSUADED ALL OF HER CO-WORKERS,
FIVE OTHER WOMEN, TO ADOPT THE SAME REGIMEN.
"THE SIX OF US," SHE SAID, "HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER SO LONG THAT OUR PERIODS HAVE ALMOST BECOME SYNCHRONIZED. I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT EPO—ALL OF US WITH PMS
AT THE SAME TIME EACH MONTH."
I GIVE A LOT OF SPEECHES ABOUT HERBAL MEDICINE AROUND THE WORLD, AND I LIKE TO TELL MY AUDIENCES ABOUT EPO. AFTER ONE
SPEECH, A WOMAN PROUDLY TOLD ME THAT SHE'D BEEN TAKING EPO FOR HER PMS FOR
YEARS, AND SHE HAD EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL RELIEF. THEN, IN A WHISPER, SHE CONFIDED THAT SHE WORKED FOR THE FDA, THE VERY AGENCY WHOSE REGULATIONS HAVE
SOMETIMES DENIED THIS VALUABLE NATURAL TREATMENT TO THE MILLIONS OF AMERICAN
WOMEN WHO SUFFER PREMENSTRUAL DISCOMFORT.
I SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR HERE THAT EPO IS NOW AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY FOR
WOMEN TO USE. WHAT I'M COMPLAINING ABOUT IS THAT THE FDA FORBIDS LABELING
THIS PRODUCT AS HELPFUL IN TREATING PMS.
EVENING PRIMROSE
THE LEAVES AND FLOWERS OF
EVENING PRIMROSE, AN
AMERICAN INDIAN FOOD
PLANT, PRODUCE A VALUABLE
SEED OIL THAT HELPS RELIEVE
PREMENSTRUAL COMPLAINTS.
365
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THE FDA SHOULD KNOW THAT EPO IS NOT HARMFUL. AND IN ADDITION TO THE
WOMAN I MET, MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE FDA KNOW THAT IT ALLEVIATES PMS SYMPTOMS. BUT THE AGENCY WON'T APPROVE IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ACCEPT THE BRITISH
SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES.
THE FDA NEEDS AMERICAN STUDIES SUBMITTED BY A U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANY INTENT ON MARKETING EPO. BUT A DRUG COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER
EPO AS A NEW DRUG AND SPEND UP TO $500 MILLION TO PROVE IT SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. WHAT PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM IN ITS RIGHT MIND WOULD INVEST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS TO PROVE THAT EPO RELIEVES PMS WHEN ANYONE CAN SIMPLY GO OUT AND FORAGE
THE SEEDS AND USE THEM?
AROUND MARYLAND, WHERE I LIVE, EVENING PRIMROSE SEEDS CAN BE HARVESTED
FREE ALL WINTER LONG. I HAVE GATHERED AS MUCH AS A POUND DURING A TWO-HOUR
OUTING. AND WHETHER YOU GATHER THE SEEDS YOURSELF OR PURCHASE EPO AT A NATURAL
FOOD STORE OR PHARMACY, THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP YOU FROM USING EPO TO TREAT PMS.
VV STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). THIS IS A TRADITIONAL LIVER TONIC OFTEN
RECOMMENDED FOR RIDDING THE BODY OF ALL KINDS OF TOXINS. WHEN THE LIVER IS SLUGGISH, IT PROCESSES ESTROGEN SLOWLY, CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH LEVELS THAT MAY CAUSE OR
AGGRAVATE PMS. THIS HERB CAN ALSO REDUCE BLOATING AND BREAST TENDERNESS. I SUGGEST TRYING A TEA MADE WITH EQUAL PARTS OF STINGING NETTLE AND BURDOCK.
V BURDOCK (ARCTIUM LAPPA). BURDOCK IS ALSO A TRADITIONAL LIVER TONIC,
AND I BELIEVE THAT ITS MILD STIMULATING EFFECTS ON THAT ORGAN MAKE IT USEFUL FOR
TREATING THE IRRITABILITY OF PMS. BURDOCK IS ALSO MILDLY DIURETIC, WHICH MEANS IT
MAY HELP RELIEVE PMS-RELATED BLOATING AND BREAST TENDERNESS, BOTH OF WHICH
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TOO MUCH FLUID IN THE SYSTEM.
V RASPBERRY (RUBUS IDAEUS). RASPBERRY IS BEST KNOWN AS A PREGNANCY
TONIC THAT QUIETS AN IRRITABLE UTERUS. BUT I'VE HEARD MANY GOOD HERBALISTS PRAISE IT
FOR HELPING TO TREAT PMS AS WELL. AS A SAFE AND TASTY BEVERAGE, IT'S PROBABLY WORTH
A TRY.
V SKULLCAP (SCUTELLARIA LATERIFLORA) AND VALERIAN (VALERIANA OFFICINALIS). BOTH OF THESE HERBS ARE SEDATIVE/TRANQUILIZERS THAT MIGHT HELP RELIEVE THE
NERVOUS TENSION AND IRRITABILITY OF PMS.
V SOY PRODUCTS, PEANUTS AND OTHER LEGUMES. TOFU AND OTHER SOY
PRODUCTS CONTAIN NATURAL BUT WEAK PLANT ESTROGENS (PHYTOESTROGENS) THAT LIMIT THE
UPTAKE OF THE ESTROGEN PRODUCED BY THE BODY. THIS ANTI-ESTROGEN EFFECT HAS BEEN
CREDITED WITH HELPING TO PREVENT BREAST CANCER, AND I DON'T SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T
ALSO HELP EASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS. ALTHOUGH SOYBEANS HAVE GOTTEN A GOOD DEAL
OF ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN THE ESTROGENIC COMPOUND GENISTEIN, PEANUTS,
BLACK BEANS AND LIMA BEANS OFTEN CONTAIN EVEN MORE OF THIS COMPOUND. AND THE
SCURFY PEA (PSORALEA CORYLIFOLHA) HAS SOME 50 TIMES MORE GENISTEIN THAN SOYBEANS.
366
PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT
T
HE PROSTATE IS A SMALL GLAND THAT ONLY MEN HAVE. IT SITS JUST ABOVE THE
RECTUM AND PROVIDES A GOOD DEAL OF THE FLUID IN SEMEN. UNLIKE MOST
BODY PARTS, THE PROSTATE GLAND GROWS LARGER AS MEN AGE, A CONDITION KNOWN AS
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY (BPH). BY AGE 40,10 PERCENT OF MEN HAVE SOME
DEGREE OF PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT. BUT AT AGE 50, THE FIGURE IS 50 PERCENT, AND IT
KEEPS INCREASING AS THE YEARS PASS. WHY IS THIS CAUSE FOR CONCERN?
THE MALE URETHRA, THE TUBE THROUGH WHICH URINE PASSES, IS ENCIRCLED BY THE
PROSTATE GLAND. AS THE PROSTATE GROWS LARGER, IT PINCHES THE URETHRA, CAUSING
BPH SYMPTOMS. IT BECOMES HARDER TO URINATE FORCEFULLY, AND MEN WITH BPH
HAVE DIFFICULTY EMPTYING THE BLADDER COMPLETELY. THE HALLMARK SYMPTOM IS
HAVING TO GET UP AT NIGHT TO URINATE.
OWN THE GAUNTLET
I'M BETTING MY OWN PROSTATE GLAND THAT HERBAL TREATMENTS WORK BETTER THAN
THE MOST COMMONLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS OR SURGERY FOR CONTROLLING BPH, ALSO
CALLED NONCANCEROUS PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FINASTERIDE (PROSCAR) AND TERAZOSIN (HYTRIN) HAVE
BECOME BIG MONEYMAKERS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE
APPROVED TO PREVENT PROSTATIC PROLIFERATION, THE GROWTH OF NEW PROSTATE CELLS
THAT CAUSES BPH IN MEN OVER 50.
I ANNOUNCED MY INTENTIONS TO CHALLENGE PROSCAR WITH THE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES, SAW PALMETTO, LICORICE AND PUMPKIN SEEDS, IN THE EARLY 1990S, SHORTLY
AFTER THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVED THE DRUG. I DID IT PUBLICLY AT A CONFERENCE IN FRONT OF DOZENS OF OFFICIALS FROM THE FDA AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH). I WANTED ALL OF THE "MAGIC BULLET" PROPONENTS
TO SEE THAT NOT EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG WAS THE BEST ANSWER
FOR BPH.
I PUBLICLY BET MY PROSTATE GLAND THAT MY MIXTURE OF SAW PALMETTO, LICORICE
AND PUMPKIN SEEDS, WHICH I BLEND INTO SOMETHING I CALL PROSNUT BUTTER (SEE
PAGE 370), WOULD DO THE SAME THING THAT PROSCAR DOES. I ALSO DECLARED THAT IT
WAS CHEAPER AND PROBABLY SAFER.
THE OTHER REASON THAT I BET MY PROSTATE IN PUBLIC WAS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE
SOME PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING MY LIFE'S AMBITION, WHICH IS GETTING THE FDA
TO MAKE THE DRUG COMPANIES TEST THEIR NEW SYNTHETIC DRUGS NOT ONLY AGAINST AN
367
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
INACTIVE SUBSTANCE (A PLACEBO) BUT ALSO AGAINST ANY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED HERBAL ALTERNATIVE.
IF THE SYNTHETIC PROVES TO BE BETTER THAN THE PLACEBO AND THE HERBS, THEN, FINE,
APPROVE THE DRUG. BUT IF THE HERBS PROVE TO BE BETTER, OR EVEN REASONABLY CLOSE IN
EFFECTIVENESS, THEN BOTH SHOULD BE APPROVED. TO RECOUP ITS INVESTMENT IN THE RESEARCH, THE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM COULD GET SOME MARKETING PRIVILEGES FOR THE
PROCESSED HERB EXTRACT AS WELL AS ITS NEW SYNTHETIC. THIS WAY, PEOPLE COULD HAVE A
CHOICE BETWEEN THE PHARMACEUTICAL, WHICH IS ALWAYS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE, AND
THE HERBAL ALTERNATIVE, WHICH IS ALWAYS CHEAPER.
A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF PROSCAR COSTS ABOUT $800. A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF SAW PALMETTO
AND LICORICE WOULD BE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THAT, AND IF YOU STOCKED UP ON
PUMPKIN SEEDS AROUND HALLOWEEN, YOU COULD GET THEM DIRT CHEAP, POSSIBLY EVEN
FOR FREE.
UNTIL PROSCAR AND HYTRIN CAME ALONG, THE ONLY MEDICALLY RECOGNIZED TREATMENT FOR BPH WAS SURGERY. ONE PROCEDURE IS KNOWN AS TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION OF
THE PROSTATE (TURP). TURP IS THE MOST COMMON OPERATION PERFORMED ON MEN OVER
65. DURING A TURP, THE UROLOGIST THREADS AN INSTRUMENT UP THE URETHRA AND CUTS
AWAY PART OF THE PROSTATE GLAND TO ENLARGE THE OPENING FOR THE URETHRA, THUS EASING
URINE FLOW. TURP GENERALLY WORKS WELL, BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE AND CARRIES THE USUAL
RISKS OF SURGERY, AND RECOVERY TAKES A WEEK OR TWO.
PROSCAR AND HYTRIN HAVE BEEN WIDELY HAILED AS ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE
CHEAPER AND LESS TRAUMATIC THAN SURGERY. BUT HERBS ARE CHEAPER STILL.
HERTS ON I RIAL
THE DRUGS KEEP PROSTATE CELLS FROM PROLIFERATING BY PREVENTING THE GLAND FROM
CONVERTING THE MALE SEX HORMONE TESTOSTERONE INTO A RELATED COMPOUND, DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE, THAT STIMULATES PROSTATE CELL PROLIFERATION.
WHILE THE DRUGS DO INDEED PREVENT THIS PROCESS FROM OCCURRING, THE NATURAL
ALTERNATIVES THAT I MENTIONED WORK AT LEAST AS WELL. IN FACT, IN MY OPINION, AND IN
THE OPINIONS OF MANY NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS, THE HERBS WORK A WHOLE LOT BETTER.
PROSCAR, ESPECIALLY, HAS DEFINITE DRAWBACKS. MOST MEN MUST TAKE IT FOR AT LEAST
SIX MONTHS BEFORE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BECOMES APPARENT. AND IT DOESN'T
WORK FOR EVERYONE. FEWER THAN HALF OF MEN TAKING PROSCAR EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT
CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT EVEN AFTER ONE YEAR.
PROSCAR ALSO HAS SOME DISTURBING SIDE EFFECTS, AMONG THEM DECREASED
LIBIDO, EJACULATORY PROBLEMS AND ERECTION LOSS. IN CONTRAST, HERBS LIKE SAW
PALMETTO, LICORICE AND PUMPKIN SEEDS ARE NOT REPORTED TO CAUSE ANY OF THESE
PROBLEMS.
368
PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT
HERE ARE THE DETAILS ABOUT THE HERBS THAT I CAN SAY WITHOUT RESERVATION PROVIDE THE BEST RESULTS.
W%> LICORICE (GLYCYRRKIZA GLABRA). LICORICE CONTAINS A COMPOUND THAT PREVENTS THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERONE TO DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE. TAKING VERY LARGE DOSES
OF LICORICE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME CAN PRODUCE HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND
WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. SOME 25 CASES
HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN THE WORLD MEDICAL LITERATURE, AND THE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOPED PROBLEMS ATE TWO TO FOUR OUNCES OF REAL LICORICE CANDY A DAY FOR YEARS.
I DOUBT THAT THE LICORICE EXTRACT IN MY PROSNUT BUTTER WOULD CAUSE ANY
PROBLEMS. I'VE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED NO SYMPTOMS. BUT IF YOU TRY THE HERBAL
APPROACH TO BPH, BE ALERT TO ANY SYMPTOMS AND CUT DOWN DRASTICALLY ON YOUR
LICORICE INTAKE IF YOU EXPERIENCE THEM.
VVV PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO). PUMPKIN SEEDS WERE THE TRADITIONAL
TREATMENT FOR BPH IN BULGARIA, TURKEY AND THE UKRAINE. THE RECOMMENDATION
WAS A HANDFUL OF SEEDS A DAY THROUGHOUT ADULTHOOD.
THE FATTY OIL IN PUMPKIN SEEDS IS A POWERFUL DIURETIC, A FACT THAT HAS CAUSED
SOME NAY-SAYERS TO ASSERT THAT ANY
INCREASED URINE FLOW HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH RELIEF FROM BPH.
PUMPKIN SEEDS, HOWEVER, ALSO
CONTAIN CHEMICALS CALLED CUCURBITACINS THAT APPEAR TO PREVENT
SOME TRANSFORMATION OF TESTOSTERONE INTO DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE.
IN ADDITION, PUMPKIN SEEDS CAN
CONTAIN AS MUCH AS EIGHT MILLIGRAMS OF ZINC
PER HALF-CUP SERVING. NATUROPATHS JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN
SEATTLE, AND MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D, CO-AUTHORS OF
A TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL MEDICINE, SUGGEST TAKING
60 MILLIGRAMS OF ZINC PER DAY FOR TREATING BPH. (THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN THE
DAILY VALUE, SO BE SURE TO CHECK WITH A DOCTOR BEFORE YOU BEGIN TAKING THIS MUCH
ZINC.)
ZINC HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PROSTATE, PRESUMABLY BY INHIBITING THE CONVERSION PROCESS MENTIONED EARLIER. PUMPKIN SEEDS ARE ALSO
HIGH IN CERTAIN AMINO ACIDS—ALANINE, GLYCINE AND GLUTAMIC ACID. DR. MURRAY
/
PUMPKIN
THIS ORANGE FRUIT IS MORE THAN
A HALLOWEEN PROP: ITS SEEDS
CONTAIN A SUBSTANCE THAT CAN
HELP RELIEVE PROSTATE PROBLEMS.
36Q
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
AND DR. PIZZOMO REPORT THAT IN A STUDY OF 45 MEN WHO WERE GIVEN SUPPLEMENTS
OF THESE AMINO ACIDS (200 MILLIGRAMS OF EACH) EVERY DAY, THE REGIMEN SIGNIFICANTLY RELIEVED BPH SYMPTOMS.
•"! A HALF-CUP SERVING OF PUMPKIN
SEEDS CAN HAVE 1,150 TO 1,245 MILLIGRAMS OF ALANINE, 1,800 TO 1,930 MILLIGRAMS OF GLYCINE AND 4,315 TO 4,635
MILLIGRAMS OF GLUTAMIC ACID. THAT'S
ANYWHERE FROM 5 TO 20 TIMES THE DOCTORS' DAILY RECOMMENDATION.
FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, PLUS GOOD
FLAVOR, I STRESS A GOOD QUANTITY OF
PUMPKIN SEEDS IN PROSNUT BUTTER.
THERE ARE SOME OTHER SEEDS THAT
CONTAIN THESE BENEFICIAL AMINO ACIDS.
BUFFALO GOURD SEEDS CONTAIN GENEROUS
AMOUNTS OF ALL THREE, PEANUTS AND
SESAME SEEDS ARE HIGH IN GLYCINE, AND
ALMONDS, BUTTERNUTS AND PEANUTS ARE
HIGH IN GLUTAMIC ACID.
V * ^ SAW PALMETTO (SERENOA
REPENS)* SHORTLY AFTER PROSCAR WAS APPROVED BY THE FDA, THE AGENCY BANNED
ALL NONPRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR BPH. THE
BAN WAS IMPOSED FOR TWO REASONS, ACCORDING TO VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND
PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY
(NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE
UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA.
FIRST, THE FDA SAID THAT NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED TO SHOW THAT ANY
OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) PRODUCTS WERE
EFFECTIVE. SECOND, THE AGENCY EXPRESSED
THE VIEW THAT PEOPLE WHO USED THE OTCS
MIGHT DELAY GETTING PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT AS THEIR CONDITION WORSENED.
"WHAT THE FDA OVERLOOKED," SAYS DR. TYLER, "WAS THE CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE IN WESTERN EUROPE THAT CERTAIN PHYTOMEDICINALS (PLANT-BASED MEDIPROSATUT BUTTER
DO YOU LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND CRACKERS?
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU COULD MUNCH A
FEW EVERY DAY AS A SNACK? IF YOUR ANSWER
IS YES, THEN YOU MIGHT EVEN ENJOY THIS
"MEDICINE" FOR BENIGN PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT (BPH).
THE THREE INGREDIENTS IN THIS NUTTY
SPREAD, PUMPKIN SEEDS, SAW PALMETTO AND
LICORICE, HAVE ALL BEEN SHOWN TO HELP PREVENT AND RELIEVE BPH.
TO MAKE THE SPREAD, PLACE A HALF-CUP
OR SO OF FRESH PUMPKIN SEEDS IN A BLENDER
OR FOOD PROCESSOR. OPEN ONE SAW PALMETTO
CAPSULE AND POUR IN THE CONTENTS, THEN ADD
A FEW DROPS OF LICORICE EXTRACT AND BLEND
UNTIL SMOOTH. (YOU CAN ADD A FEW DROPS OF
BRAZIL NUT OIL IF YOU NEED TO MAKE THE MIXTURE A LITTLE MORE SPREADABLE.) ALL OF THESE
INGREDIENTS ARE AVAILABLE IN MOST HEALTH
FOOD STORES.
USE PROSNUT BUTTER LIKE PEANUT BUTTER,
EATING A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONFULS EVERY DAY.
YOU CAN EAT IT ON CRACKERS OR ON BREAD, IF
YOU PREFER, OR TRY IT WITH A LITTLE JELLY. SINCE
YOU WANT THE INGREDIENTS TO BE FRESH, DON'T
MIX UP A BIG BATCH AT ONCE. MAKE JUST
ENOUGH TO LAST A COUPLE OF DAYS.

PROSTATE ENLARGEMEN T
CINES) ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING BPH AND THAT PEOPLE USING THEM EXPERIENCE AN
APPRECIABLE INCREASE IN THEIR COMFORT LEVEL. PERHAPS THE MOST POPULAR OF THESE
IS SAW PALMETTO.... THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS INCLUDE INCREASED URINARY FLOW, REDUCED RESIDUAL URINE AND DECREASED FREQUENCY OF URINATION."
SAW PALMETTO IS A SMALL PALM TREE THAT GROWS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED
STATES, PARTICULARLY IN FLORIDA AROUND THE EVERGLADES. SEMINOLE INDIANS ATE THE
SAW PALMETTO SEED AS FOOD; PERHAPS THEY NOTICED THAT IT HELPED URINARY PROBLEMS. WHITES ADOPTED IT AS A DIURETIC TO HELP FLUSH EXCESS WATER FROM THE BODY,
AND OVER TIME IT CAME TO BE USED FOR BPH.
IT WORKS BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A COMPOUND THAT INHIBITS THE ACTION OF THE ENZYME (TESTOSTERONE-5-ALPHA-REDUCTASE) THAT TURNS TESTOSTERONE INTO DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE. PREVENTING THIS TRANSFORMATION OF TESTOSTERONE IS ALSO THE WAY
PROSCAR WORKS, BUT SAW PALMETTO DOES THE JOB IN A DIFFERENT AND APPARENTLY
MORE EFFECTIVE WAY.
TO DATE, A HALF-DOZEN WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECTIVENESS
OF SAW PALMETTO. IN ONE STUDY, A CLINICAL TRIAL INVOLVING MORE THAN 2,000 GERMANS WITH BPH, A DAILY DOSE OF ONE TO TWO GRAMS OF SAW PALMETTO SEEDS (OR 320
MILLIGRAMS OF ITS HEXANE EXTRACT) PRODUCED SUBSTANTIAL EASING OF BPH SYMPTOMS.
VV PYGEUM (PYGEUM AFRICANUM). IN ONE STUDY, GERMAN RESEARCHERS
GAVE EITHER PYGEUM OR A PLACEBO TO 250 MEN WITH BPH. IN THE PLACEBO GROUP, 31
PERCENT REPORTED IMPROVEMENT, A TYPICAL RESPONSE RATE FOR A PLACEBO. IN THE
PYGEUM GROUP, THE FIGURE WAS 66 PERCENT.
THE RECOMMENDED DOSE IS 50 MILLIGRAMS OF BARK EXTRACT TWICE A DAY. DEPENDING ON THE METHOD AND CONCENTRATION OF THE EXTRACT, THIS COULD REPRESENT A
GRAM OR A KILOGRAM OF BARK. ALTHOUGH THE EXTRACTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE IN HEALTH
FOOD STORES, THEY ARE MADE FROM A SPECIES THAT COULD BE ENDANGERED BY OVERHARVESTING. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES LISTED IN THIS CHAPTER
BEFORE RESORTING TO THIS ONE.
W STINGING NETTLE {URTICA DIOICA). ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF ANOTHER
STUDY, EXTRACTS OF STINGING NETTLE ROOTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED BPH. RESEARCHERS
GAVE A FEW TEASPOONS OF THE EXTRACT DAILY TO 67 MEN OVER AGE 60 WITH BPH AND
FOUND THAT THE HERB SIGNIFICANDY REDUCED THEIR NEED TO GET UP AT NIGHT TO URINATE.
THE HERB APPARENTLY HAS SOME INHIBITORY EFFECT ON THE CONVERSION OF TESTOSTERONE.
GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS RECOMMEND TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF EXTRACT A DAY TO
TREAT BPH.

PSORIASIS
I
FIRST DEVELOPED SOMETHING A DERMATOLOGIST DIAGNOSED AS LICHEN PLANUS, A
TYPE OF PSORIASIS, ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO. RATHER SYMMETRICAL PATCHES OF
ITCHY SCALES BEGAN APPEARING ON BOTH OF MY LEGS. THEN SIMILAR SMALL PATCHES
APPEARED ON BOTH ARMS.
ALTHOUGH MY DOCTOR WAS QUICK TO COME UP WITH A DIAGNOSIS, HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT HAD CAUSED WHAT HE SAID WAS PSORIASIS OR HOW TO CURE IT. HE GAVE ME
SALVES, STEROIDS AND VITAMINS, BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK. I WOULD HAVE TRIED
SUNLIGHT, A STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS, AND A NATURAL ONE, BUT IT WAS
WINTER, AND THERE JUST WASN'T MUCH SUN. I NEARLY SCRATCHED MY SKIN TO THE BONE.
THEN A FUNNY THING HAPPENED. WHEN I LEFT THE INTEMPERATE CLIMATE OF
MARYLAND FOR THE TROPICAL CLIMATE OF ECUADOR, MY "PSORIASIS" CLEARED UP. NOW
I'M CONVINCED THAT THE DOCTOR WAS WRONG. I DON'T THINK I HAD PSORIASIS, JUST DRY
SKIN. WE HEAT OUR HOUSE WITH OIL-FIRED, HOT-WATER RADIATORS. THEY PRODUCE A DRY
HEAT THAT APPARENTLY PARCHED MY SKIN TO THE POINT WHERE MY SYMPTOMS APPEARED. EVERY YEAR, A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE FIRST FROST, WHEN WE START HEATING THE
HOUSE, MY SKIN ACTS UP BY GETTING DRY, ITCHY AND FLAKY. FOR ME, THE BEST TREATMENT IS A TRIP TO THE HUMID TROPICS, ONE OF MANY REASONS THAT I LOVE THE
AMAZON. BUT MY SKIN CONDITION HAS CERTAINLY PIQUED MY INTEREST IN PSORIASIS.
IT ALSO LEADS TO THE FIRST LESSON HERE: DOCTORS DON'T KNOW ALL THAT MUCH
ABOUT TREATING PSORIASIS, AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE WRONG WHEN THEY DIAGNOSE IT. IT
MAKES GOOD SENSE TO INVESTIGATE GENTLE HERBAL APPROACHES BEFORE SUBMITTING
YOURSELF TO HARSHER MEDICAL TREATMENTS THAT DON'T ALWAYS DO THE TRICK ANYWAY.
SKIN TKAT MIST ENAVES
PSORIASIS CAUSES RED, SCALY PATCHES OF VARYING SIZES, USUALLY ON THE SCALP
AND LOWER BACK AND OVER THE ELBOWS, KNEES AND KNUCKLES. ON THE TOENAILS AND
FINGERNAILS, IT CAUSES PITTING AND BROWNISH DISCOLORATION, AND SOMETIMES IT
CAUSES THE NAIL TO LIFT AND CRACK.
TYPICALLY, THE RASH FIRST APPEARS IN TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS. IT MAY CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE PERSON'S LIFE, INCREASING AND DECREASING IN SEVERITY, OFTEN
FOR NO APPARENT REASON. PSORIASIS LEAVES NO SCARS AND USUALLY ITCHES ONLY WHEN
IT APPEARS IN BODY CREASES. IN SEVERE CASES, IT MAY CAUSE SCALES, CRACKS AND
BLISTERS ON THE PALMS OF THE HANDS AND THE SOLES OF THE FEET. PSORIASIS MAY ALSO
CAUSE A RASH ON THE GENITALS, PROFUSE SHEDDING OF DEAD SKIN FLAKES AND EVEN
372
PSORIASI S
(ALTHOUGH RARELY) ARTHRITIS INVOLVING THE SPINE AND LARGE JOINTS.
PSORIASIS AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED 2 TO 4 PERCENT OF AMERICANS, WITH WHITES ACCOUNTING FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CASES. THE CONDITION IS A MEDICAL
MYSTERY. IT'S NOT CAUSED BY AN INFECTION OR ALLERGIC REACTION, NOR DOES IT APPEAR
TO BE CAUSED BY STRESS, FOODS OR VITAMIN OR MINERAL DEFICIENCIES. IT MAY BE AN
AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION, MEANING THAT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE BODY. IT'S
NOT CONTAGIOUS.
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PSORIASIS ISN'T HEREDITARY, YET FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON
IT SOMETIMES SHOWS UP IN SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS. ILLNESSES, SCRAPES AND
BRUISES AND EMOTIONAL UPSETS CAN MAKE IT WORSE.
PSORIASIS SOMEHOW INTERFERES WITH THE NORMAL GROWTH AND REPLACEMENT
CYCLE OF SKIN CELLS. NORMALLY, THE BODY REPLACES SKIN CELLS EVERY 28 DAYS OR SO.
PSORIASIS SPEEDS UP THIS PROCESS TO FIVE TO TEN TIMES THE NORMAL RATE, WHICH
CAUSES THE BUILDUP OF SCALY PATCHES.
AS I'VE MENTIONED, SUNLIGHT OFTEN HELPS GET RID OF THE PATCHES. MANY OF US
NOW AVOID SUNBATHING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SUN EXPOSURE CONTRIBUTES TO RISING
RATES OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA SKIN CANCER. FOR PEOPLE WITH PSORIASIS, HOWEVER,
THE BENEFITS OF SUNLIGHT COULD OUTWEIGH THE RISKS. WHEN THE WEATHER OR THE
SEASON DOESN'T ALLOW SUNBATHING, SUNLAMPS ARE AN ALTERNATIVE.
FOR MILD CASES, DOCTORS MAY RECOMMEND OVER-THE-COUNTER 0.5 PERCENT HYDROCORTISONE CREAMS, AND STRONGER PRESCRIPTIONS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. THE NEWEST
TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS, PUVA, INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF EXPOSURE TO UVA, ONE
TYPE OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT, AND TAKING COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS PSORALENS. PSORALENS
ARE FOUND IN PLANTS AND ALSO SHOW UP IN CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICALS. BECAUSE
PUVA HAS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, IT SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY A
PSORIASIS SPECIALIST.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR PSORIASIS
FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN SOMETIMES PROVIDE
SIGNIFICANT RELIEF.
W V BISHOP'S WEED (AMNRI VISNAGA). THE "NEW" PUVA TREATMENT IS ACTUALLY
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD. THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS AND INDIANS RUBBED RED, SCALY SKIN
PATCHES (PRESUMABLY PSORIASIS) WITH PLANTS CONTAINING PSORALENS AND THEN HAD
PEOPLE SIT IN THE SUN.
BISHOP'S WEED CONTAINS A GOOD DEAL OF ONE OF THESE PSORALENS (METHOXYPSORALEN), SO ITS REPUTATION AS A PSORIASIS TREATMENT MAKES SENSE. THE LATEST
STUDIES HAVE SHED LIGHT ON WHY PSORALEN TREATMENT WORKS. THESE COMPOUNDS INHIBIT CELL DIVISION, SLOWING DOWN THE FAST-DIVIDING SKIN CELLS THAT CAUSE PSORIASIS
PATCHES. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH HERB, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THIS ANCIENT
373
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TREATMENT A TRY. DO BE CAUTIOUS, HOWEVER; IF THIS TREATMENT SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOUR
SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE. (HIGH DOSES OF PSORALENS CAN BE CARCINOGENIC.)
W%> RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THANKS TO AN ARTICLE IN
PREVENTION MAGAZINE, I HAVE ALSO FOUND ONE HERBAL TREATMENT THAT SEEMS TO HELP
BOTH DRY SKIN AND PSORIASIS—HOT PEPPER, SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE MANY CREAMS
CONTAINING 0.025 PERCENT CAPSAICIN. CAPSAICIN IS THE COMPOUND THAT MAKES HOT -
PEPPERS HOT. CAPSAICIN CREAMS SUCH AS ZOSTRIX AND CAPZASIN-P ARE SOLD AS PAIN
RELIEVERS, AND THEY WORK.
IN ONE STUDY, 98 PEOPLE WITH PSORIASIS USED A CAPSAICIN CREAM, WHILE 99
OTHERS TREATED THEIR SKIN PATCHES WITH AN INACTIVE CREAM (A PLACEBO). THE
CAPSAICIN GROUP SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED BOTH SCALING AND REDNESS, ALTHOUGH THE
HOT-PEPPER CREAM CAUSED SOME BURNING, STINGING AND ITCHING.
IF YOU USE A CAPSAICIN CREAM, BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY
AFTERWARD SO THAT YOU WON'T GET IT IN YOUR EYES. AND, OF COURSE, IF YOU ULTIMATELY
GET FURTHER IRRITATION RATHER THAN RELIEF FROM THE CREAM, DON'T USE IT AGAIN.
W ANGELICA (ANGELICA ARCHANGELICA) AND OTHER HERBS CONTAINING
PSORALENS. MANY PLANTS CONTAIN PSORALENS. TO GET A NATURAL VERSION OF A COMMONLY PRESCRIBED TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS, TAKE ANY HERB OR HERBS CONTAINING PSORALENS, THEN SPEND A LITTLE TIME IN THE SUNLIGHT, WHICH OF COURSE SUPPLIES ULTRAVIOLET
LIGHT. FOOD PLANTS THAT CONTAIN PSORALENS INCLUDE SOME OF MY FAVORITES, SUCH AS
ANGELICA, CARROTS, CELERY, CITRUS FRUITS, FIGS, FENNEL AND PARSNIPS.
HERE'S A PLEASANT TREATMENT TO TRY: PICK A SUNNY AFTERNOON AND MIX UP
SOME OF MY PSORIAPHOBIC CITRUS JUICE: SIMPLY TOSS A MIXTURE OF CITRUS FRUITS
(WITH A BIT OF PEEL), A CARROT AND A CELERY STALK INTO YOUR JUICER. OR PERHAPS
YOU'D RATHER COOK UP MY PSORALEN SOUP BY ADDING CARROTS, CELERY, PARSNIPS AND
FENNEL TO YOUR FAVORITE VEGETABLE SOUP RECIPE. REMEMBER TO GO OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT OR GET UNDER A SUNLAMP IMMEDIATELY AFTER EATING IT. BUT BE VERY CAREFUL IF
YOU DECIDE TO TRY HERBS THAT CONTAIN PSORALENS, AS LARGE DOSES OF THESE COMPOUNDS CAN BE CARCINOGENIC. AND IF YOU NOTICE ANY IRRITATION, STOP USING THE
THERAPY.
VV AVOCADO (PERSEA AMERICANA). FOLK HEALERS HAVE LONG RECOMMENDED RUBBING MASHED AVOCADO ON PSORIASIS PATCHES. IT'S CERTAINLY COOL AND
SOOTHING. IF I HAD PSORIASIS, I'D TAKE A PIECE OF THE INNER PEEL WITH A LITTLE GREEN
PULP ADHERING TO IT AND RUB IT ON MY SCALY PATCHES.
W BRAZIL NUT (BERTHOLETTIA EXCELSA). THESE NUTS CONTAIN AN OIL RICH IN
VITAMIN E AND SELENIUM. IN THE AMAZON, PEOPLE USE THIS OIL TO TREAT SKIN CONDITIONS, AND SOME SKIN CREAMS AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES CONTAIN VITAMIN E.
CURIOUS ABOUT ITS EFFECTS, FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS I APPLIED THE OIL RELIGIOUSLY
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE RETIRING. LIKE ANY EMOLLIENT OIL, IT SOOTHED AND CURBED THE
374
PSORIASIS
ITCHING. BRAZIL NUT OIL CAN BE PURCHASED AT HEALTH FOOD STORES AND SEEMS TO BE
WORTH TRYING.
^ ^ CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE PREPARATIONS ARE WIDELY
USED IN EUROPE TO TREAT PSORIASIS, ECZEMA AND DRY, FLAKY SKIN. NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS IN THIS COUNTRY MAINTAIN THAT APPLYING THIS HERB EXTERNALLY WORKS BETTER THAN
COMMONLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS FOR TREATING PSORIASIS. COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS
FLAVONOIDS, WHICH ARE FOUND IN CAMOMILE, HAVE SIGNIFICANT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY. YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIAL CREAMS CONTAINING CAMOMILE AT HEALTH FOOD STORES.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION.
IF IT SEEMS, TO HELP, YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE
ITCHING WORSE, SIMPLY DISCONTINUE USE.
W FLAX (LINUM USITATISSIMUM). SEVERAL PLANT OILS ARE CHEMICALLY
SIMILAR TO FISH OILS, WHICH HAVE A REPUTATION FOR HELPING TO RELIEVE PSORIASIS.
FLAXSEED OIL, FOR ONE, CONTAINS THE BENEFICIAL COMPOUNDS EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID
AND ALPHA-LINOLENIC ACID. I'VE REVIEWED STUDIES SHOWING THAT 10 TO 12 GRAMS (FIVE
TO SIX TEASPOONS) OF THESE ACIDS CAN HELP TREAT PSORIASIS. YOU WON'T WANT TO SIP THIS
MUCH FLAXSEED OIL, BUT BELIEVING AS I DO THAT EVERY HTTLE BIT HELPS, I THINK THAT YOU
MIGHT WANT TO ADD SOME FLAXSEED OIL TO YOUR SALAD DRESSINGS. (FLAXSEED OIL IS VERY
HIGH IN CALORIES, HOWEVER, SO IF YOU USE THIS THERAPY, BE SURE TO ADJUST THE REST OF
YOUR DIET ACCORDINGLY.)
W LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). NATUROPATHS CONSIDER EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS OF LICORICE TO BE EQUAL OR SUPERIOR TO HYDROCORTISONE CREAM FOR TREATING PSORIASIS. THEY NOTE THAT THE COMPOUND GLYCYRRHETENIC ACID (GA), WHICH IS FOUND IN
LICORICE, WORKS RATHER LIKE HYDROCORTISONE IN TREATING PSORIASIS, ECZEMA AND ALLERGIC DERMATITIS. OTHER SCIENTISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT HYDROCORTISONE WORKS CONSIDERABLY BETTER WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH GA.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE THIS HERB A TRY, BUY A LICORICE EXTRACT AND APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREAS USING A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN CLOTH.
"W OAT (AVENA SATIVA). OATMEAL IS A HALLOWED FOLK REMEDY FOR RELIEF OF
ITCHING. SOME HERBALISTS RECOMMEND USING OATMEAL-PASTE PACKS OR OATMEAL BATHS TO
TREAT PSORIASIS.
YOU CAN EITHER SCOOP A FEW HANDFULS OF OATMEAL INTO A WARM BATH OR PUT THE
OATMEAL IN A PIECE OF CHEESECLOTH AND TIE IT UP TO PREVENT THE STICKY OATMEAL
FROM CLOGGING THE DRAIN. THIS TREATMENT RELIEVED MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S ITCHY
CHICKEN POX, SO I'VE SEEN FIRST-HAND HOW WELL IT RELIEVES ITCHING.
W OREGON GRAPE {MAHONIA AQUIFOLIUM). ALL OF THE ANTI-PSORIASIS
CHEMICALS IN OREGON GRAPE, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL, ARE POTENT ANTIOXIDANTS. THIS
375
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
MEANS THAT THEY NEUTRALIZE THE HIGHLY REACTIVE MOLECULES KNOWN AS FREE RADICALS THAT DAMAGE CELLS AND PLAY A ROLE IN INFLAMMATORY DISEASES LIKE PSORIASIS.
THE SAME CHEMICALS ARE ALSO FOUND IN BARBERRY, GOLDENSEAL, GOLDTHREAD AND
YELLOWROOT.
IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS SHOWED THAT COMPOUNDS IN THESE HERBS—MAHONIA ALKALOIDS—SLOWED THE PROLIFERATION OF CERTAIN SKIN CELLS. IF I HAD A PSORIASIS FLARE-UP, I'D PLAN TO TRY THE YELLOW BARKS OF ANY OF THESE PLANTS. THEY CAN
BE TAKEN AS TEAS OR TINCTURES OR IN CAPSULES.
VV PURSLANE (PORTIDACA OLERACEA). HERB ADVOCATE ANDREW WEIL, M.D.,
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, RECOMMENDS SEVERAL NUTRIENTS FOR
TREATING PSORIASIS, INCLUDING VITAMINS A, C AND E, PLUS THE MINERAL SELENIUM
AND ALPHA-LINOLENIC ACID. IN MY DATABASE, PURSLANE IS THE BEST PLANT SOURCE OF
VITAMINS A, C AND E. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH PURSLANE, YOU CAN ENJOY IT
STEAMED LIKE SPINACH OR USE THE YOUNG SHOOTS IN SALADS.
V FUMITORY (FUMARIA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS HERB CONTAINS FUMARIC
ACID, A COMPOUND THAT SEEMS TO BE USEFUL FOR TREATING PSORIASIS. BREW A STRONG
FUMITORY TEA AND APPLY IT DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA WITH A COTTON BALL OR CLEAN
CLOTH.
^ LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL, FOLLOWED BY AN ALMOND OIL CREAM. FM
NOT SURPRISED, SINCE AROMATHERAPISTS USE LAVENDER FOR TREATING ALL MANNER OF SKIN
PROBLEMS, INCLUDING PSORIASIS. IT'S WORTH A TRY. BUT DO NOT INGEST THE OIL, AS EVEN A
SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.
V MILK THISTLE (SILYBUM MARIANUM). MILK THISTLE HAS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT, SILYMARIN, THAT'S REPORTEDLY USEFUL IN RELIEVING PSORIASIS. IN FACT, MILK THISTLE
SEED CONTAINS AT LEAST EIGHT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS THAT MAY ACT ON THE
SKIN. THIS HERB IS TAKEN AS A TEA OR TINCTURE OR IN CAPSULES.
376
RAYNAUD'S DISEASE
H
AVE YOU EVER HEARD THE EXPRESSION, "COLD HANDS, WARM HEART"? I DON'T
KNOW IF ONE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OTHER, BUT IF YOU SUFFER THE
PAINFULLY COLD, BLUISH-WHITE FINGERS OF RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, LET ME SUGGEST WARM
SOUP. I RECOMMEND A VEGETARIAN MINESTRONE LIBERALLY SPICED WITH CAYENNE,
GARLIC, GINGER AND MUSTARD, PLUS OILS OF BORAGE, CURRANT AND EVENING PRIMROSE.
MAKE A LOT. EAT UNTIL YOU'RE SATISFIED. THEN STRAIN OUT SOME BROTH AND RUB IT
ON YOUR FRIGID FINGERS. FINALLY, I WOULD HEARTILY SUGGEST FOLLOWING UP YOUR ANTIRAYNAUD'S SOUP BY TAKING THE HERB GINKGO.
IF A DOCTOR HEARD ME SUGGEST THIS APPROACH, SHE MIGHT THINK I WAS OFF MY
ROCKER. I BEG TO DIFFER. THERE'S REASONABLY GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND EVERY ONE OF MY
SUGGESTIONS, AND THIS IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MAINSTREAM MEDICINE'S APPROACH TO RAYNAUD'S DISEASE.
TNE MAINSTREAM APPROACK
RAYNAUD'S DISEASE SEEMS TO BE CAUSED BY CONSTRICTION AND SPASMS OF THE
SMALL ARTERIES (ARTERIOLES) THAT BRING BLOOD TO THE FINGERS. AS BLOOD FLOW DIMINISHES, THE FINGERS BECOME PAINFUL AND TURN WHITE OR BLUISH. RAYNAUD'S ALSO OCCASIONALLY OCCURS IN THE NOSE AND TOES. IT IS MUCH MORE COMMON AMONG
WOMEN.
WHILE RAYNAUD'S MAY OCCUR INDEPENDENTLY OF OTHER CONDITIONS, SOMETIMES
IT'S A SYMPTOM OF SCLERODERMA, A RARE AND SERIOUS DISEASE THAT INVOLVES HARDENING OF THE SKIN AND DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL ORGANS. DOCTORS OFTEN PRESCRIBE
CORTICOSTEROIDS SUCH AS PREDNISONE (DELTASONE, ORASONE) TO TREAT BOTH RAYNAUD'S AND SCLERODERMA. BUT CORTICOSTEROIDS HAVE MANY POTENTIALLY TROUBLING
SIDE EFFECTS, SUCH AS WEIGHT GAIN, ACNE AND IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT. AND THEY SOMETIMES MAKE RAYNAUD'S DISEASE WORSE.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR RAYNAUD'S DISEASE
BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS SOMETIMES CAUSED BY CORTICOSTEROIDS, I THINK IT
MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE TO TREAT RAYNAUD'S WITH SELECTIONS FROM THE GREEN
PHARMACY.
W V EVENING PRIMROSE {OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THE OIL MADE FROM EVENING
PRIMROSE (EPO) CONTAINS A GOOD DEAL OF GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA). SOME
STUDIES SUGGEST THAT GLA HELPS RELIEVE SYMPTOMS OF RAYNAUD'S DISEASE.
377
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IN ONE STUDY, EPO WAS MASSAGED INTO THE FINGERS OF PEOPLE WITH RAYNAUD'S
DISEASE. ABOUT HALF IMPROVED, MORE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT IF THIS WERE SIMPLY
A PLACEBO RESPONSE. I SUSPECT THAT BOTH THE MASSAGE AND THE EPO HELPED.
V W GARLIC {ALLIUM SATIVUM). IN ONE EXCELLENT STUDY THAT LASTED 12 WEEKS,
RESEARCHERS GAVE A DAILY DOSE OF 800 MILLIGRAMS OF GARLIC TO PEOPLE WITH INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION, A CONDITION CAUSED BY A NARROWING OF THE ARTERIES IN THE
LEGS. PEOPLE WITH SEVERE CLAUDICATION HAVE DIFIFICULTY WALKING. BY THE END OF THE
STUDY, THOSE WHO TOOK AN INACTIVE SUBSTANCE (A PLACEBO) SHOWED NO IMPROVEMENT IN WALKING, BUT THE GROUP TAKING GARLIC WALKED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER,
STRONGLY SUGGESTING THAT THE BLOOD FLOW TO THEIR LEGS HAD IMPROVED.
GARLIC WORKS TO IMPROVE CIRCULATION. IN FACT, MORE THAN ONE ALTERNATIVE
MEDICINE ADVOCATE SUGGESTS USING GARLIC AND GINKGO, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN TO
HELP CIRCULATION, IN COMBINATION TO TREAT RAYNAUD'S DISEASE. I SUGGEST SIMPLY
ADDING MORE GARLIC TO YOUR DIET. YOU CAN ALSO TAKE CAPSULES, IF YOU PREFER.
W V GINKGO {GINKGO BILOBA). LITERALLY DOZENS OF STUDIES SHOW THAT GINKGO
IMPROVES BLOOD CIRCULATION. MOST OF THE RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THIS HERB'S ABILITY
TO PROMOTE BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE BRAIN, WHICH IS WHY GINKGO EXTRACT IS WIDELY
PRESCRIBED IN EUROPE FOR RECOVERY FROM STROKE AND THE MENTAL SLOWING OF OLD AGE.
BUT SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED GINKGO'S EFFECTS ON INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION.
WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE CLAUDICATION TAKE GINKGO, OVER TIME THE HERB IMPROVES THEIR ABILITY TO WALK. WHILE THE REASONS FOR THE IMPAIRED
CIRCULATION ARE DIFFERENT, RAYNAUD'S IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR
TO CLAUDICATION, EXCEPT THAT IT AFFECTS THE FINGERS INSTEAD
OF THE LEGS.
EUROPEAN PHYSICIANS FREQUENTLY RECOMMEND
GINKGO FOR RAYNAUD'S, AND THERE ARE MANY EUROPEAN CASE REPORTS OF PEOPLE WITH RAYNAUD'S EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT AFTER TAKING IT. IT MAKES
SENSE TO ME. IF I HAD THIS CONDITION, I WOULD TRY
GINKGO.
THE MEDICINAL PART OF THE PLANT IS THE LEAF,
BUT THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS (GINKGOLIDES) OCCUR IN
SUCH LOW CONCENTRATION THAT THERE'S LITTLE POINT IN
USING THE LEAVES TO MAKE TEA. IF YOU WANT TO TRY
THIS HERB, BUY GINKGO PILLS OR CAPSULES MADE FROM
STANDARDIZED EXTRACT. IT'S USUALLY A 50:1 RATIO,
MEANING THAT 50 POUNDS OF GINKGO LEAVES ARE
PROCESSED TO YIELD 1 POUND OF EXTRACT. LOOK FOR
THESE EXTRACTS IN HEALTH FOOD STORES AND HERB
BORAGE, AN ANNUAL THAT
GROWS ABOUT TWO FEET TALL, WAS
USED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS TO
FLAVOR WINE.
378
SCABIES
SHOPS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT.
IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
W BORAGE (BORAGO OFFICINALIS). LIKE EVENING PRIMROSE, BORAGE CONTAINS
GLA, WHICH HELPS TREAT RAYNAUD'S WHEN MASSAGED INTO THE FINGERS.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). CHINESE HERBALISTS OFTEN RECOMMEND
THIS "HOT" HERB TO TREAT CONDITIONS INVOLVING COLD, INCLUDING THE COLD FINGERS
CAUSED BY RAYNAUD'S. GINGER LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL LEVELS, AND
BOTH EFFECTS HELP NORMALIZE BLOOD FLOW ALL OVER THE BODY, INCLUDING THE FINGERS.
VV MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA, SINAPIS ALBA AND OTHERS). I'M SURE
YOU'VE HEARD OF MUSTARD PLASTERS. WHEN APPLIED TO THE SKIN, THEY CAUSE MILD IRRITATION THAT INCREASES THE LOCAL BLOOD SUPPLY, RESULTING IN A WARM, TINGLING SENSATION. MEDICALLY KNOWN AS RUBEFACIENTS, MUSTARD AND OTHER HERBS WITH THIS EFFECT
HAVE LONG BEEN USED TO TREAT RAYNAUD'S DISEASE.
YOU CAN MAKE A MUSTARD PLASTER BY MIXING FOUR OUNCES OF FRESH GROUND
MUSTARD SEED WITH WARM WATER TO MAKE A THICK PASTE. TRY APPLYING THIS TO YOUR
FINGERS WHEN SYMPTOMS ARE ACTING UP. OTHER RUBEFACIENTS, ACCORDING TO BRITISH
HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK, INCLUDE CLOVES,
GARLIC, GINGER, HORSERADISH, STINGING NETTLE, PEPPERMINT OIL, ROSEMARY OIL AND
RUE. ANY OF THESE CAN BE APPLIED TO THE FINGERS.
VV RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS IS THE CLASSIC RUBEFACIENT. BACK IN THE OLD DAYS, PEOPLE USED TO SPRINKLE IT IN THEIR SHOES TO KEEP THEIR
FEET WARM IN WINTER. IF I HAD RAYNAUD'S, I'D TRY MIXING SOME WITH VEGETABLE OIL AND
RUBBING IT ON MY FINGERS. (JUST BE SURE NOT TO TOUCH YOUR EYES IF YOU HAVE ANY ON
YOUR FINGERTIPS.) I MIGHT EVEN ADD SOME TO EPO, BORAGE OIL OR CURRANT OIL. YOU CAN
USE IT EXTERNALLY, BUT OF COURSE RED PEPPER IS A SPICY ADDITION TO ANY FOOD, ESPECIALLY SALAD DRESSING.
V INDIAN SNAKEROOT (RAIIWOLFIA SERPENTINA). THIS HERB CONTAINS THE
CHEMICAL RESERPINE, WHICH OPENS (DILATES) THE BLOOD VESSELS. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN USED TO
TREAT RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, ACCORDING TO MEDICINAL HERB EXPERT WALTER LEWIS, PH.D.,
PROFESSOR AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, AND MEMORY ELVIN-LEWIS, PH.D., AUTHORS OF MEDICAL BOTANY.
SCABIES
MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO, HURRICANE HAZEL FORCED ME TO SPEND A NIGHT
IN A BARN IN SOUTH CAROLINA. I WAS HITCHHIKING ALONG RURAL ROADS, INNOCENT OF THE FACT THAT A SERIOUS STORM WAS BREWING UNTIL I WAS FORCED TO TAKE
379
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
REFUGE. I GOT SHELTER FROM THE STORM. I ALSO GOT SCABIES, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE
TINY MITES THAT CAUSE IT INFEST ANIMALS AS WELL AS HUMANS.
SCABIES IS A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS PARASITIC SKIN INFESTATION CAUSED BY MITES OF
THE GENUS SARCOPTES. ESPECIALLY COMMON IN CHILDREN, INFESTATIONS CAUSE SMALL,
ITCHY BUMPS, SOMETIMES ALL OVER THE BODY AND SOMETIMES LOCALIZED BETWEEN
THE FINGERS, ON THE WRISTS, ON THE WAIST, IN THE GROIN OR ON THE GENITALS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SCABIES
DRUG COMPANIES HAVE COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER AND PRESCRIPTION MITE KILLERS. BUT I'D RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THE NATURAL ALTERNATIVES
AND MOVING ON TO THE SYNTHETICS ONLY IF YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A REALLY BAD CASE
THAT HERBS DON'T CURE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL.
BUT WHATEVER YOU USE, OTHER MEASURES ARE NECESSARY: IN ADDITION TO TREATING
YOUR BODY, YOU HAVE TO BOIL ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES AND BEDDING TO KILL ANY MITES ON
THEM SO YOU AREN'T REINFECTED.
VVV EVENING PRIMROS E (OENOTHERA BIENNIS) AND ST.-JOHN'S-WORT
(HYPERICUM PERFORATUM). EVENING PRIMROSE OIL (EPO) IS APPROVED IN THE
UNITED KINGDOM FOR TREATING ECZEMA BECAUSE IT SOOTHES THE SKIN. BUT IT'S NOT APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TURNS A
BLIND EYE TO EUROPEAN RESEARCH, AND NO U.S. DRUG COMPANIES WANT TO INVEST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO PROVE THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN'T
PATENT.
AS FOR ST.-JOHN'S-WORT, I'VE SEEN PERSUASIVE
ANECDOTAL REPORTS THAT APPLYING THIS HERB TO THE
SKIN CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF FROM THE
ITCHING OF INSECT BITES.
IF I HAD SCABIES, I WOULD STEEP FLOWERING
SHOOTS OF ST.-JOHN'S-WORT FOR A FEW DAYS
IN ENOUGH EPO TO COVER THEM, THEN
DAB THE OIL ON THE AFFECTED AREAS. IF
YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH
HERB, YOU CAN USE A TINCTURE OF ST.-
JOHN'S-WORT.
V W NEEM (AZADIRACTA INDIE A)
AND TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). NEEM IS AN
INDIAN TREE WITH AN EXTRACT THAT IS POWERFULLY ACTIVE AGAINST MANY INSECT PESTS. SEVERAL NATURAL
NEEM-BASED PESTICIDES ARE MARKETED IN THIS
COUNTRY AND USED BY ORGANIC FARMERS AND GARNEEM
ORIGINALLY FROM INDIA, NEEM IS
WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE
UNITED STATES AS A NATURAL
COSMETIC, DENTIFRICE AND INSECT
REPELLENT.
380
SCABIES
DENERS. TURMERIC HAS A LONG FOLK HISTORY FOR TREATING ITCHY SKIN PROBLEMS.
A FEW YEARS AGO, INDIAN RESEARCHER S. X. CHARLES, PH.D., USED THESE TWO HERBS
TO TREAT 814 PEOPLE WITH SCABIES. HE MADE A PASTE WITH FOUR PARTS FRESH NEEM LEAVES
AND ONE PART TURMERIC ROOT. THE PEOPLE IN HIS STUDY RUBBED IT ALL OVER THEMSELVES
DAILY. ALMOST 800 OF THEM (98 PERCENT) SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT WITHIN
THREE TO FIVE DAYS AND WERE COMPLETELY CURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS. YOU CAN BUY SKINCARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING NEEM AT SOME HEALTH FOOD STORES. JUST MIX IN SEVERAL TEASPOONS OF TURMERIC AND APPLY IT TO THE AFFECTED AREAS.
VVV ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). WHEN I WAS A KID, I BOILED ONION SKINS TO MAKE
A YELLOW DYE. NOW IN MY SECOND CHILDHOOD, I BOIL ONION SKINS TO EXTRACT QUERCETIN,
ONE OF NATURE'S BEST SKIN-SOOTHING COMPOUNDS. SOME ONION SKINS ARE 3 PERCENT
QUERCETIN, WHICH TRANSLATES TO CONSIDERABLE SOOTHING POWER AGAINST SCABIES AND
OTHER SKIN PROBLEMS.
FOR SCABIES, I SUGGEST BOILING THE SKINS OF A HALF-DOZEN ONIONS FOR 15 TO 30
MINUTES IN A QUART OF WATER. LET THE LIQUID COOL, THEN APPLY IT LIBERALLY ALL OVER
YOUR BODY. (SAVE THE PEELED ONIONS TO USE IN COOKING.)
VV AMERICAN PENNYROYAL (HEDEOMA PULEGIOIDES). ALMOST 2,000
YEARS AGO, THE ROMAN NATURALIST PLINY NOTED THAT EUROPEAN PENNYROYAL (MENTHA
PIDEGIUM) REPELS FLEAS. IN FACT, THIS HERB'S SCIENTIFIC NAME, PULEGIOIDES, IS DERIVED
FROM THE LATIN FOR "FLEA," AND THE PLANT HAS BEEN POPULARLY KNOWN AS FLEABANE FOR
CENTURIES. PENNYROYAL OIL IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN JUST ABOUT EVERY HERBAL FLEA
COLLAR FOR PETS.
I SUGGEST APPLYING A STRONG TEA OR
PREFERABLY A TINCTURE DIRECTLY TO THE
AFFECTED AREA TO ALLEVIATE THE ITCH.
W MOUNTAIN MINT (PYCNANTHEMUM MUTICUM). THIS WEEDY,
THREE-FOOT-TALL HERB IS LOADED WITH
PULEGONE, THE SAME INSECT REPELLENT
FOUND IN PENNYROYAL. IT'S NOT A POPULAR
HERB, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. IT'S
A FINE WEED TO GROW AROUND THE HOUSE,
AND IT HAS MANY USES.
I OFTEN BALL UP A WAD OF FRESH
MOUNTAIN MINT AND RUB THE BRUISED
LEAVES ON MY LEGS TO KEEP THE TICKS L~., - ~. ......
OFF. I SUSPECT THAT THIS HERB WOULD BE
EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST MITES AND LICE.
VV OAT (ARENA SATIVA). WHILE WAITING FOR YOUR HERBAL MITE KILLERS TO GET
PREGNANCY ALERT
AMONG THE HERBS MENTIONED IN THIS
CHAPTER ARE A FEW THAT PREGNANT WOMEN
SHOULD AVOID COMPLETELY—PENNYROYAL,
PEPPERMINT, MOUNTAIN MINT AND TANSY. IF
YOU'RE PREGNANT, YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE THESE
HERBS ORALLY OR APPLY THEM TO YOUR SKIN.
WHEN YOU APPLY AN HERB TO YOUR SKIN BY
ADDING IT TO BATHWATER OR IN THE FORM OF AN
ESSENTIAL OIL, SOME OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS
DO PENETRATE THE SKIN AND GET INTO THE
BLOODSTREAM.

CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
THE JOB DONE, YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP THE ITCHING. OATMEAL WORKS QUITE WELL. JUST
SCOOP A FEW HANDFULS INTO A HOT BATH AND SETTLE IN.
VV STAR ANISE (IUICIUM VERUM). THE OIL OF STAR ANISE IS BEST KNOWN AS AN
ANTISEPTIC, BUT IT IS ALSO REPORTEDLY USEFUL AGAINST SCABIES, LICE AND BEDBUGS. JUST
DAB IT ON THE AFFECTED AREAS.
V * TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). LIKE STAR ANISE, TEATREE OIL IS
BEST KNOWN AS AN ANTISEPTIC, BUT IT'S ALSO USEFUL AGAINST PARASITES, INCLUDING THOSE
THAT CAUSE SCABIES. BEFORE PUTTING THE OIL ON YOUR SKIN, YOU SHOULD DILUTE IT BY
ADDING SEVERAL DROPS TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF ANY VEGETABLE OIL.
REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL OILS,
INTERNALLY. THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MANY
OF THEM CAN BE POISONOUS.
VV WALNUT (JUGLANS, VARIOUS SPECIES). WALNUTS CONTAIN A CHEMICAL
CALLED JUGLONE THAT IS USEFUL FOR DEALING WITH MITE INFESTATIONS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. DR. LEUNG RECOMMENDS MAKING A WASH BY BOILING A FEW CRACKED WALNUT SHELL PIECES IN A CUP OF
WATER UNTIL ABOUT HALF OF THE WATER HAS EVAPORATED. TO CREATE A CONCENTRATED SOLUTION, COVER SEVERAL WHOLE WALNUTS WITH WATER AND SIMMER UNTIL HALF OF THE WATER IS
GONE. APPLY THE WATER LIBERALLY TO THE SKIN.
V ALOE (ALOE VERA). THE SOOTHING GEL OF ALOE CONTAINS THE COMPOUND
BRADYKININASE, WHICH SHOULD HELP TO RELIEVE THE ANNOYING ITCH AND IRRITATION OF A
SCABIES RASH.
^. FIVE-LEAVED CHASTETREE (VUEX NEGUNDO). THE LEAVES OF THIS CHINESE
SHRUB HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF FOLK USE AS A POULTICE FOR TREATING SCABIES, ECZEMA AND
RINGWORM. FIVE-LEAVED CHASTETREE IS AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS AN ORNAMENTAL PLANT. YOU CAN MASH THE LEAVES AND APPLY THEM DIRECDY TO THE AFFECTED
AREAS OF SKIN.
V PEPPERMINT (MENTHA PIPERITA). THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN PEPPERMINT
IS MENTHOL, WHICH HAS COOLING, ANESTHETIC AND ANTISEPTIC PROPERTIES. SOME RESPECTED HERBALISTS FREQUENTLY RECOMMEND MENTHOL AND RELATED COMPOUNDS FOR
TREATING SCABIES, SO LET ME PROPOSE AN HERB TEA THAT YOU CAN USE IN YOUR BATH TO
KILL SCABIES MITES WHILE ALLEVIATING THE ITCH. MIX PEPPERMINT, PENNYROYAL, ROSEMARY, SAGE, SPEARMINT AND THYME IN ANY PROPORTIONS YOU LIKE. MAKE ENOUGH TEA
SO THAT YOU CAN TOSS SEVERAL CUPS INTO YOUR WARM BATHWATER AND ALSO ENJOY A CUP OR
TWO AS A TASTY, STRESS-REDUCING BEVERAGE.
V TANSY (TANACETUM VULGARE). PRACTITIONERS OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
OFTEN RECOMMEND WASHING WITH STRONG TANSY TEA AS A TREATMENT FOR SCABIES OR LICE.
382
SCIATICA
I
HAD NEVER USED VISUALIZATION APPROACHES TO HEALING UNTIL A STORY TOLD BY
ONE OF THE FEW DOCTORS I REALLY ADMIRE MADE ME RECONSIDER. THIS TALE
COMES FROM ANDREW WEIL, M.D., PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA COLLEGE
OF MEDICINE IN TUCSON AND AUTHOR OF NATURAL HEALTH, NATURAL MEDICINE, WHO
HAS BECOME ONE OF THE TOP NATIONAL EXPERTS ON NATURAL, ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.
DR. WEIL TELLS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD EXCRUCIATING SCIATIC PAIN FOR TWO YEARS,
DURING WHICH TIME SHE SOUGHT HELP FROM SOME 20 DOCTORS. HER PAIN CONTINUED
UNDIMINISHED.
SCIATICA IS A CONDITION THAT INVOLVES PAIN THAT RUNS FROM THE LOWER BACK TO
THE BUTTOCKS AND/OR THE OUTER BACK OF THE LEG. IT RADIATES ALONG THE SCIATIC
NERVE, HENCE THE NAME. SOMETIMES THE SCIATIC NERVE FIBERS ALSO BECOME INFLAMED.
PERHAPS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS WOMAN FELT I KNOW I CAN: I SUFFERED THROUGH
SOME OF THE WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE AFTER SLIPPING A DISK IN MY BACK, A CONDITION RELATED TO SCIATICA.
AFTER ENDURING TWO YEARS OF PAIN, THIS WOMAN EXPERIENCED A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH WHEN HER GRANDDAUGHTER PAID HER A VISIT. SHE FORCED HERSELF TO GET OUT
OF BED TO TEND TO THE CHILD. TO HER ASTONISHMENT, SHE FOUND THAT WHEN SHE ACTED
AS IF SHE FELT AIL RIGHT, SHE ACTUALLY FELT BETTER.
SHE ABANDONED HER PHYSICIANS, WHO APPARENTLY WEREN'T ABLE TO HELP HER
MUCH ANYWAY, AND STARTED DOING WHAT SHE WANTED TO DO INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY
PRESCRIBED. SHE SOUGHT OUT ACUPUNCTURE TREATMENT TO RELIEVE HER PAIN. SHE
STARTED TAKING VITAMINS, AND SHE BEGAN LISTENING TO TAPES CONTAINING VISUALIZATION EXERCISES AIMED AT HEALING BACK PAIN.
ALL OF THESE TREATMENTS SEEMED TO HELP: SHE FELT BETTER AND KEPT IMPROVING.
AND SHE DECIDED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF HER SELF-DEVISED PROGRAM
WAS HER VISUALIZATIONS. HER BASIC TECHNIQUE WAS TO IMAGINE MORE BLOOD GOING
INTO HER BACK.
HER PAIN FINALLY DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. DR. WEIL CHECKED UP ON HER
SEVEN YEARS LATER, AND SHE WAS STILL FINE, WITH NO SCIATIC PAIN.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SCIATICA
ALONG WITH THE SEVERAL NATURAL APPROACHES THAT THE WOMAN IN DR. WEIL'S
STORY TRIED, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL IN RELIEVING
THIS KIND OF PAIN.
383
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VVV HAYSEED (A MIXTUR E OF GRASS SEEDS, ESPECIALLY ANTHOXANTHON
ODOR A TURN). MANY YEARS AGO, THE EUROPEAN NATUROPATH PARSON KNEIPP LEARNED
WHAT PEOPLE IN THE ALPS DID WITH THE SEED HEADS OF THE VARIOUS GRASSES THAT THEY
STORED AS HAY TO FEED THEIR ANIMALS THROUGH THE WINTER. THEY SWEPT UP THE HAYSEED
AND ADDED IT TO BATHS, BECAUSE THEY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THIS SEED HAS THE ABILITY TO
SOOTHE PAINFUL BACKS, JOINTS AND MUSCLES. KNEIPP POPULARIZED THE USE OF HAYSEED
FOR THIS PURPOSE, AND TODAY MANY EUROPEANS SUBSCRIBE TO KNEIPP THERAPY, USING
HAYSEED THAT HAS BEEN PACKAGED IN BATH BAGS OR PREPARED IN THE FORM OF HOT
POULTICES.
THE HOT HAYSEED POULTICES USED IN KNEIPP THERAPY HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY
COMMISSION E, THE GROUP OF HERBAL MEDICINE EXPERTS APPOINTED BY THE GERMAN
COUNTERPART OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO JUDGE THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL THERAPIES. ACCORDING TO COMMISSION E, THE POULTICES ARE
EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING A RANGE OF RHEUMATIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS SCIATICA.
BUT HOW DOES HAYSEED WORK? IT CONTAINS A GOOD DEAL OF A COMPOUND CALLED
COUMARIN, A CAMPHORLIKE SUBSTANCE THAT BOOSTS LOCAL BLOOD FLOW WHEN APPLIED
EXTERNALLY, ACCORDING TO RUDOLPH FRITZ WEISS, M.D., GERMANY'S LEADING HERBAL
PHYSICIAN. (DR. WEISS'S BOOK, HERBAL MEDICINE, IS USED IN GERMAN MEDICAL
SCHOOLS.)
I'VE HEARD PRETTY AMAZING TESTIMONIALS ENDORSING HAYSEED BATHS AND POULTICES FOR RELIEVING SCIATIC PAIN. IF I HAD SCIATICA, I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THIS APPROACH A TRY. ASK FOR KNEIPP THERAPY AT SPECIALTY BATH OR HERB SHOPS.
W%, STINGING NETTLE (URTICA DIOICA). PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FLAILING THEIR BAD
BACKS WITH THE STINGING NETTLE PLANT SINCE ROMAN TIMES. THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT
INVOLVES TAKING SPRIGS OF THE FRESH PLANT AND SLAPPING IT AGAINST THE PAINFUL AREA.
BE WARNED, THOUGH: THIS PRACTICE STINGS LIKE CRAZY. BUT THAT IS PART OF THE
TREATMENT. THE STING IS A COUNTERIRRITANT, SOMETHING THAT CAUSES MINOR PAIN AND
IN EFFECT FOOLS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO DISREGARDING DEEPER PAIN. THAT'S NOT ALL
THAT STINGING NETTLE DOES, HOWEVER. CHEMICALS IN THE STINGERS THAT CAUSE INFLAMMATION SEEM TO TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THE BODY'S NATURAL AND-INFLAMMATORY CHEMICALS. SO THE BODY'S OWN MEDICINE HELPS GET RID OF THE SCIATIC INFLAMMATION.
POULTICES MADE FROM STINGING NETTLE ARE ALSO GOOD FOR SCIATICA, ACCORDING
TO DR. WEISS. (REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO WEAR GLOVES WHENEVER YOU HANDLE
THIS PLANT TO PROTECT YOUR PALMS FROM THE STINGERS.)
V W WILLOW (SALLX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK CONTAINS SALICIN, THE
HERBAL EQUIVALENT OF ASPIRIN. IT CAN HELP RELIEVE SCIATIC PAIN, AND COMMISSION E
RECOGNIZES IT AS AN EFFECTIVE PAIN RELIEVER FOR EVERYTHING FROM HEADACHE TO ARTHRITIS.
THE SALICIN CONTENT OF WILLOW VARIES FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES. I SUGGEST
STARTING WITH A LOW-DOSE TEA MADE WITH A HALF-TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB AND
384
SCIATICA
WORKING YOUR WAY UP TO A DOSE THAT PROVIDES EFFECTIVE PAIN RELIEF.
AS WITH ASPIRIN, LONG-TERM USE OF WILLOW BARK MAY CAUSE STOMACH DISTRESS
AND EVEN ULCERS, SO I SUGGEST SWEETENING WILLOW BARK TEA WITH A LITTLE LICORICE,
WHICH HAS ULCER-PREVENTING BENEFITS. AND IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE HERBAL ASPIRIN, EITHER.
V \ V WINTERGREEN (GAULTHERIA PROCUMBENT).
WINTERGREEN CONTAINS METHYL SALICYLATE, A CLOSE RELATIVE OF THE SALICIN IN WILLOW BARK, AND IT'S ABOUT EQUAL
IN ITS ABILITY TO RELIEVE PAIN. IT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF
USE BOTH INTERNALLY IN TEA AND EXTERNALLY IN BATHS AND
OINTMENTS FOR RELIEVING PAINFUL CONDITIONS, AMONG THEM
SCIATICA AND GOUT. I USE IT BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY
MYSELF.
ABSORPTION THROUGH THE SKIN MAY ACTUALLY BE MORE
RAPID THAN THROUGH THE STOMACH. IN THE UNITED STATES
THERE ARE MORE THAN 40 PRODUCTS ON DRUGSTORE SHELVES
THAT CONTAIN METHYL SALICYLATE AS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT.
ALL ARE FOR EXTERNAL USE, AND MOST ARE USED TO TREAT VARIOUS KINDS OF PAIN, MOST FREQUENTLY ARTHRITIC, RHEUMATIC
AND SCIATIC PAIN.
WARNING: YOU MUST KEEP PRODUCTS CONTAINING WINTERGREEN OIL OR ANY PRODUCT CONTAINING METHYL SALICYLATE
OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. THE MINTY SMELL CAN BE
VERY TEMPTING, BUT INGESTING EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS CAN
PROVE FATAL TO YOUNG CHILDREN. IN THE UNITED STATES, LIQUID PREPARATIONS CONTAINING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF METHYL SALICYLATE (MORE THAN FIVE MILLILITERS) MUST
HAVE CHILD-RESISTANT PACKAGING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WINTERGREEN TEA,
BUT DO TAKE PRECAUTIONS WITH COMMERCIAL PAIN-RELIEF PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR EXTERNAL USE.
^V CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI,
CHINESE ANGELICA IS REVERED IN TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE AS THE LEADING TREATMENT FOR GYNECOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS. IT'S OFTEN CALLED THE FEMALE GINSENG. BUT CHINESE ANGELICA ALSO HAS MILD SEDATIVE, PAIN-RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND
ANTISPASMODIC PROPERTIES THAT MAKE IT A GOOD HERB TO TRY FOR SCIATICA.
IN CHINA, PHYSICIANS INJECT THEIR PATIENTS WITH CHINESE ANGELICA EXTRACT TO
TREAT SCIATIC PAIN. I'VE REVIEWED DATA FROM CHINESE CLINICAL TRIALS SHOWING THAT
WHEN THIS EXTRACT IS INJECTED INTO THE ACUPUNCTURE POINTS USED TO TREAT SCIATICA,
ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF PEOPLE RECEIVING TREATMENT REPORT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.
I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND INJECTING IT, BUT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TAKEN IN A TEA OR
WINTERGREEN
WINTERGREEN IS A LOWGROWING EVERGREEN
SHRUB WITH EDIBLE RED
BERRIES; ITS ALSO
KNOWN AS SPICEBERRY
OR TEABERRY.
385
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
TINCTURE. I SUGGEST ADDING IT TO WINTERGREEN TEA. (DO NOT TAKE THIS HERB IF YOU ARE
PREGNANT, HOWEVER.)
W COUNTRY MALLOW (SIDA CORDIFOLIA). INDIA'S TRADITIONAL AYURVEDIC
PHYSICIANS HAVE LONG USED THIS HERB TO TREAT SCIATICA AND OTHER PAINFUL MUSCULAR
AND NERVOUS SYSTEM COMPLAINTS. THE REASON APPEARS TO BE ITS HIGH CONCENTRATION
OF EPHEDRINE: IT CONTAINS SOME 850 PARTS PER MILLION. THE COMPOUND EPHEDRINE IS
BEST KNOWN AS A BRONCHIAL DECONGESTANT AND STIMULANT, BUT IT ALSO IS SOMETHING OF
A MUSCLE TONIC, WHICH IS PRESUMABLY WHY IT HELPS RELIEVE SCIATICA.
V * MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA, SINAPIS ALBA AND OTHERS). EVER HEAR OF A
MUSTARD PLASTER? THIS HOME TREATMENT HAS A LONG FOLK HISTORY OF USE AS A TREATMENT
FOR BOTH RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS AND RHEUMATIC PROBLEMS LIKE SCIATICA.
MUSTARD IS AROMATIC, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR SOME OF ITS USE AS A BRONCHIAL DECONGESTANT. BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT REASON THAT IT'S USED FOR SCIATICA, ARTHRITIS, LUMBAGO, NEURALGIA AND RHEUMATISM. MUSTARD IS A RUBEFACIENT COUNTERIRRITANT, WHICH
MEANS IT CAUSE A SOOTHING FEELING OF WARMTH ON THE SKIN WHILE ITS COUNTERIRRITANT
PROPERTIES CAUSE MILD IRRITATION, DISTRACTING THE BODY FROM THE DEEPER PAIN OF SCIATICA. THE COMBINATION OF HEAT AND COUNTERIRRITATION HAS A PAIN-RELIEVING EFFECT.
VV SCIATICA CRESS (LEPIDIWTU VARIOUS SPECIES). DOWN SOUTH, THIS PLANT IS
ALSO CALLED PEPPERGRASS. HERBALISTS RECOMMEND APPLYING FRESH SCIATICA CRESS EXTERNALLY AS A PAIN RELIEVER. LIKE MUSTARD, THIS HERB IS BOTH A RUBEFACIENT AND A COUNTERIRRITANT, AND IT CONTAINS THE SAME HOT COMPOUNDS (ISOTHIOCYANATES) AS MUSTARD.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE) AND SESAME (SESAMUM INDICUM).
MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, RECOMMENDS THIS EGYPTIAN TREATMENT FOR
SCIATICA: MIX TWO TABLESPOONS OF GRATED GINGER WITH THREE TABLESPOONS OF SESAME
OIL AND ONE TEASPOON OF LEMON JUICE. RUB THIS MIXTURE INTO THE AFFECTED AREA. MY
GUESS IS THAT THIS HELPS BECAUSE GINGER, TOO, IS A RUBEFACIENT.
SHINGLES
S
HINGLES IS CHICKEN POX RETURNED TO HAUNT YOU.LIKE THAT MOST COMMON OF
CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES, SHINGLES IS CAUSED BY THE HERPESVIRUS. AFTER CHICKEN
POX CLEARS UP, THE VIRUS REMAINS IN THE BODY, LYING DORMANT IN NERVE CELLS. FOR
REASONS THAT REMAIN A MYSTERY, IT CAN REEMERGE DECADES LATER AS SHINGLES.
SYMPTOMS INCLUDE A PAINFUL RASH THAT USUALLY APPEARS ON THE TORSO OR FACE.
386
SHINGLES
AFTER A FEW DAYS, CHICKEN POX-LIKE BLISTERS FORM, THEN THEY CRUST OVER AND
EVENTUALLY HEAL AFTER TWO OR THREE WEEKS. SO FAR IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE THE CHILDHOOD DISEASE. IN ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WHO DEVELOP SHINGLES, HOWEVER, THE PAIN
PERSISTS FOR MONTHS AND SOMETIMES YEARS. THIS IS CALLED POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA.
FREQUENTLY, THE PAIN IS QUITE SEVERE.
SHINGLES IS ESPECIALLY COMMON IN PEOPLE OVER 60 OR THOSE WITH POOR IMMUNE FUNCTION, SUCH AS PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERGOING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY. IF
YOU DEVELOP SHINGLES, YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY FOR TREATMENT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SHINGLES
NATURE HAS GIVEN US SEVERAL HERBS THAT CAN HELP TREAT VIRAL ILLNESSES. IF I
DEVELOPED SHINGLES, I WOULD TRY ANY OF THESE APPROACHES.
W \ LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS). HERBALISTS RECOMMEND MANY
HERBS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE MINT FAMILY, ESPECIALLY LEMON BALM, OR MELISSA, TO
TREAT HERPES. THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR THIS.
LEMON BALM HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE SOME EFFECT ON VIRUSES OF THE HERPES FAMILY. VARRO TYLER,
PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE
UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, SUGGESTS
USING LEMON BALM TO TREAT VIRAL INFECTIONS.
HERPES COLD SORES ARE CAUSED BY A VIRUS
THAT BEHAVES MUCH LIKE THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES
SHINGLES; IN FACT, BOTH VIRUSES BELONG TO THE
SAME GENUS. IN ONE WELL-DESIGNED STUDY OF
116 PEOPLE WITH HERPES SORES, A LEMON BALM
CREAM HEALED THE SORES SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER
THAN AN INACTIVE CREAM (A PLACEBO).
ONE EUROPEAN ANTI-HERPES PRODUCT CONTAINS 700 MILLIGRAMS OF LEMON BALM LEAF EXTRACT PER GRAM OF CREAM-BASED OINTMENT. IT
HAS BEEN SHOWN TO SHORTEN THE HEALING TIME OF HERPES SORES BY SEVERAL DAYS.
YOU CAN ACHIEVE A SIMILAR EFFECT, ACCORDING TO DR. TYLER, FROM A TEA MADE WITH
TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED LEAF PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. APPLY THE TEA DIRECTLY TO
THE RASH WITH A COTTON PAD SEVERAL TIMES DAILY.
FOR SHINGLES, I'D SUGGEST TRYING A MIXED MINT TEA MADE WITH LOTS OF LEMON
BALM PLUS ANY OTHER MINTS THAT YOU HAVE ON HAND: HYSSOP, OREGANO, PEPPERMINT, ROSEMARY, SAGE, SELF-HEAL, SPEARMINT OR THYME. PUT A LITTLE LICORICE IN THE
TEA AS WELL. SUCH A BEVERAGE WOULD CONTAIN QUITE A FEW ANTIVIRAL, ANTI-HERPETIC
THIS HERB, A MEMBER OF THE MINT
FAMILY, HELPS COMBAT HERPES
VIRUSES.
387
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
COMPOUNDS. I SUGGEST DRINKING THE TEA AS WELL AS APPLYING IT DIRECTLY TO THE
RASH.
VVV RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE FIERY INGREDIENT IN
RED PEPPER, CAPSAICIN, IS THE HOTTEST THING GOING FOR POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA. CAPSAICIN BRINGS RELIEF BY BLOCKING PAIN SIGNALS FROM NERVES JUST UNDER THE SKIN.
STUDIES OF AN OINTMENT CONTAINING CAPSAICIN SHOWED SUCH GOOD RESULTS THAT A FEW
YEARS AGO, THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED COMMERCIAL CREAMS SUCH
AS ZOSTRIX AND CAPZASIN-P, WHICH CONTAIN THIS SUBSTANCE.
YOU CAN BUY THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS IF YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO SAVE
MONEY, SIMPLY MIX POWDERED RED PEPPER INTO ANY WHITE SKIN LOTION UNTIL IT
TURNS PINKISH, THEN DAB IT ON. BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS THOROUGHLY AFTERWARD
SO THAT YOU DON'T GET PEPPER IN YOUR EYES OR ON OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS. AND TEST IT
ON A SMALL AREA OF SKIN FIRST; IF IT CAUSES IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.
VV BAIKAL SKULLCAP (SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS). THE ROOT OF THIS PLANT,
POWDERED AND MIXED WITH WATER, WAS USED AS A FOLK TREATMENT FOR SHINGLES IN
CHINA. IT HAS KNOWN ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY, SO I THINK THIS IS WORTH A TRY.
VV CHINESE ANGELICA (ANGELICA SINENSIS). ALSO KNOWN AS DANG-QUAI, THIS
HERB IS REVERED IN ASIA AS THE BEST HERB FOR MENSTRUAL PROBLEMS AND OTHER WOMEN'S
HEALTH CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, THE CHINESE HAVE USED THE POWDERED ROOT SUCCESSFULLY TO TREAT SHINGLES. IT CAN BE USED IN TEA OR TINCTURE. (DO NOT TAKE THIS HERB IF
YOU ARE PREGNANT, HOWEVER.)
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHISA GLABRA). LEADING NATUROPATH JOSEPH PIZZORNO,
N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE AND CO-AUTHOR OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF NATURAL MEDICINE, REPORTS SEEING PEOPLE WITH SHINGLES WHOSE PAIN AND INFLAMMATION CLEARED UP WITHIN THREE DAYS FOLLOWING APPLICATION OF A LICORICE OINTMENT ON
PAINFUL AREAS. LICORICE CONTAINS SEVERAL ANTIVIRAL AND IMMUNE-BOOSTING COMPOUNDS AND SEEMS TO BE A RATIONAL CHOICE. IF I HAD SHINGLES, I'D DRINK A WEAK TEA
AND APPLY A STRONG TEA DIRECTLY TO THE RASH.
VV PASSIONFLOWER (PASSIFTORA INCARNATA). PASSIONFLOWER IS A MILD TRANQUILIZER, WHICH IS NOT A BAD IDEA IF YOU ARE BEING DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION BY THE PAIN
OF SHINGLES. BUT IT ALSO HAS REPUTED ACTIVITY AGAINST POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA. I SUGGEST ADDING SOME TO A LEMON BALM—LICORICE TEA.
V BERGAMOT (CITRUS BERGAMOTIA) AND OTHER ESSENTIAL OILS. IF YOU ENJOY
AROMATHERAPY, YOU MIGHT APPLY A FEW DROPS OF ESSENTIAL OILS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR TREATING SHINGLES. THEY INCLUDE BERGAMOT, CAMOMILE, EUCALYPTUS, GERANIUM, LAVENDER, LEMON AND TEATREE OIL. SINCE SOME FULL-STRENGTH ESSENTIAL OILS CAN
BE IRRITATING TO THE SKIN, DILUTE THEM BY ADDING SEVERAL DROPS TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF VEGETABLE OIL AND APPLY THEM DIRECDY TO PAINFUL AREAS. (NEVER INGEST ESSENTIAL OILS, AS EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.)
388
SINUSITI S
V PEAR (PYRUS^ VARIOUS SPECIES). PEAR JUICE IS RICH IN ANTIVIRAL CAFFEIC
ACID. I'D DRINK IT AND EAT LOTS OF PEARS IF I HAD SHINGLES.
V PURSLANE (PORTIDACA OLERACEA). THIS HERB HAS A FOLK REPUTATION IN
CHINA FOR TREATING HERPES. IT'S A DELICIOUS VEGETABLE THAT'S GREAT WHEN STEAMED LIKE
SPINACH. IT'S WORTH A TRY.
V SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX) AND WATERCRESS (NASTURTIUM OFFICINALE)*
RESEARCH BY JEAN CARPER, AUTHOR OF FOOD: YOUR BEST MEDICINE, SUGGESTS THAT TAKING
TWO 500-MILLIGRAM TABLETS OF THE AMINO ACID LYSINE THREE OR FOUR TIMES A DAY MIGHT
HELP RELIEVE SHINGLES SYMPTOMS.
IF THAT'S TRUE, FD SUGGEST SIMPLY EATING MORE WATERCRESS AND SOYBEANS. IN
MY DATABASE, THESE ARE THE FOODS HIGHEST IN LYSINE—2.7 PERCENT ON A DRYWEIGHT BASIS. OTHER FOODS CONTAINING LYSINE, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY,
INCLUDE BLACK BEAN SPROUTS, CAROB, LENTIL SPROUTS, LENTILS, SPINACH, VELVET
BEANS, PEAS, PUMPKIN SEEDS, ASPARAGUS, BUTTER BEANS, CHINESE CABBAGE, FAVA
BEANS, FENUGREEK AND PARSLEY.
YOU MIGHT EVEN WANT TO COOK UP SOME OF MY LYSINE SOUP. USE SEVERAL OF
THE HIGH-LYSINE BEANS AND ASPARAGUS AND FLAVOR IT WITH FENUGREEK, PARSLEY AND
LOTS OF WATERCRESS.
SINUSITIS
Y
OU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH TIGER BALM, THAT STRONG-SMELLING ORIENTAL
OINTMENT THAT COMES IN A RED TIN DECORATED WITH A TIGER. I HAVE USED IT
FOR COLDS AND HEADACHES, AND I LIKE IT. TIGER BALM IS FILLED WITH POTENT AROMATIC
HERBAL EXTRACTS—MENTHOL FROM PEPPERMINT, EUGENOL FROM CLOVES, CINEOLE FROM
CAJUPUT (A CLOSE RELATIVE OF TEATREE), CINNAMALDEHYDE FROM CINNAMON, AND CAMPHOR. IT CLEARS THE SINUSES FASTER THAN A TIGER CAN POUNCE.
SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME THAT TIGER BALM WAS BEING ABUSED AS A HALLUCINOGEN. IT SOUNDED SILLY, BUT JUST TO BE SURE, I CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) TO INQUIRE. HE LAUGHED AND SAID NO, HE
HAD NOT HEARD OF ITS BEING ABUSED. I ASKED WHY HE LAUGHED. HE SAID THAT EVERY
TIME HE HAD SINUSITIS, A CHINESE COLLEAGUE PUSHED TIGER BALM ON HIM. FINALLY
HE TRIED IT, AND HE CONFIDED, "IT WORKED."
WHEN I REMINDED HIM THAT IT WAS BASICALLY A CONCOCTION OF HERBAL
AROMATICS, HE REPLIED, "NO WONDER IT WORKS." I WISH EVERYONE AT THE FDA FELT AS
389
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HE DID. THEN MAYBE WE'D SEE HERBS APPROVED FOR ALL OF THE MEDICINAL USES THAT
THEY'RE GOOD FOR.
SINUSITIS IS INFLAMMATION, AND ALMOST ALWAYS INFECTION, OF THE AIR-FILLED
BONY CAVITIES SURROUNDING THE NASAL PASSAGES. IT TYPICALLY DEVELOPS FOLLOWING
A COLD OR A BOUT OF HAY FEVER. IT MAY ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DENTAL INFECTION.
MUCUS FILLS THE SINUSES AND THEN BECOMES INFECTED, TYPICALLY WITH BACTERIA:
HAEMOPHILUS, PNEUMOCOCCUS, STAPHYLOCOCCUS OR STREPTOCOCCUS.
SINUSITIS CAUSES NASAL CONGESTION, SOMETIMES SEVERE PAIN ACROSS THE NOSE AND
CHEEKS AND OFTEN A HEADACHE AS WELL. ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF COLDS PROGRESS TO SINUSITIS. BUT IN SUSCEPTIBLE PEOPLE, ALMOST ANYTHING THAT STARTS AS A COLD CAN TURN INTO
A SINUS INFECTION.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SINUSITIS
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP TREAT THIS CONDITION.
V W GARLIC {ALLIUM SATIVUM) AND ONION (A. CEPA). THESE RELATED HERBS
ARE BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS. GARLIC IS THE MORE POTENT, BUT ONION STILL RATES IN
MY BOOK. MANY STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED GARLIC'S ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY, MOST RECENTLY A
STUDY OF PEOPLE WITH AIDS WHO TOOK THE HERB TO WARD OFF ALL SORTS OF OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS, INCLUDING SINUSITIS.
TAKE CAPSULES IF YOU LIKE, BUT I PREFER TO PEEL AND CHOP WHOLE GARLIC CLOVES
AND USE THEM AS FOOD. NATUROPATH JANE GUILTINAN, N.D., CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT
BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE, FEELS THE SAME WAY.
WITH MY PERVERSE AFFINITY FOR ALLITERATION, MAY I SUGGEST MY SINUSOUP.
BEGIN WITH YOUR VEGETARIAN MINESTRONE AND ADD HEAPING HELPINGS OF GARLIC AND
ONIONS, PLUS HORSERADISH, HOT PEPPER AND GINGER. ON A COLD WINTER DAY, IT WARMS
THE SOUL AS IT OPENS THE SINUSES.
V \ V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS)* THIS IS ANOTHER POWERFUL BROADSPECTRUM HERBAL ANTIBIOTIC, WITH AT LEAST TWO ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS, BERBERINE AND
HYDRASTINE. NATUROPATHS MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., AND JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY, CALL GOLDENSEAL THE MOST EFFECTIVE BOTANICAL TREATMENT
FOR ACUTE BACTERIAL INFECTION. I'D HAVE TO AGREE. LATELY I'VE COMBINED GOLDENSEAL
WITH ECHINACEA AND USED IT TO TREAT ALL SORTS OF MINOR INFECTIONS. IN FACT, I CARRY IT IN
MY TRAVEL FIRST-AID KIT.
W ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). NATIVE TO THE AMERICAN
PLAINS, THIS HERB WAS A FAVORITE AMERICAN INDIAN REMEDY FOR ALL SORTS OF INFECTIONS.
GERMAN RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN BEYOND ANY DOUBT THAT ECHINACEA IS AN IMMUNE
STIMULANT THAT SPEEDS THE HEALING OF BACTERIAL, FUNGAL AND VIRAL INFECTIONS. STUDIES
IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUPPORT THESE FINDINGS.
390
SINUSITI S
VV EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS) AND PEPPERMINT (MENTHA
PIPERITA). AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST RUBBING DILUTED ESSENTIAL OILS OF EUCALYPTUS
OR PEPPERMINT ON THE FOREHEAD AND TEMPLES TO RELIEVE SINUSITIS. MIX A FEW DROPS
OF EITHER OR BOTH OILS INTO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF VEGETABLE OIL BEFORE APPLYING IT TO YOUR SKIN. YOU CAN ALSO ADD A FEW DROPS OF THE ESSENTIAL OILS TO YOUR
BATHWATER. BUT USE THESE OILS SPARINGLY, AS TOO MUCH CAN BE OVERWHELMINGLY
CAUSTIC. AND NEVER INGEST THEM; EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THESE HERBAL OILS ON HAND, THE BRUISED LEAVES WORK WELL.
YOU CAN MASH SOME LEAVES, MOISTEN THEM WITH WATER AND MAKE THEM INTO A
POULTICE. EITHER PLACE IT ON YOUR CHEST OR STUFF IT INTO YOUR NOSTRILS (BE CAREFUL
NOT TO PUSH IT IN TOO DEEPLY).
IN LESOTHO, AFRICA, PEOPLE PUSH CRUSHED MINT LEAVES UP THEIR NOSTRILS TO
DELIVER THE ANTISEPTIC OIL TO INFECTED SINUSES.
I HAVE TRIED THIS MYSELF AND THINK IT HELPS. IF
YOU DON'T HAVE PEPPERMINT ON HAND, ANY MINT
WILL DO, INCLUDING SPEARMINT, MOUNTAIN
MINT (EXCEPT IF YOU ARE PREGNANT) AND
OREGANO, ALL OF WHICH CONTAIN ANTISEPTIC
ESSENTIAL OILS. I'D ALSO SUGGEST DRINKING
TEA MADE WITH EUCALYPTUS AND ANY OF THE
MINTS.
W OREGANO (ORIGANUM VULGARE).
HERE'S A MEMBER OF THE MINT FAMILY THAT'S
SIMPLY LOADED WITH ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
OREGANO IS USEFUL AS A HOT TEA (INHALE THE VAPORS AS YOU DRINK) OR IN A MASSAGE LOTION. YOU
CAN ADD A FEW DROPS OF THE ESSENTIAL OIL TO ANY
SKIN LOTION OR TO VEGETABLE OIL.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS
BEST KNOWN AS A TREATMENT FOR THE INFIRMITIES OF
OLD AGE, PARTICULARLY STROKE, BECAUSE IT INCREASES BLOOD FLOW IN AND AROUND THE BRAIN. BUT
THIS HERB ALSO HAS RESPIRATORY BENEFITS. SEVERAL
HERBALISTS I RESPECT RECOMMEND IT FOR SINUSITIS.
THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN GINKGO (GINKGOLIDES) OCCUR NATURALLY IN A CONCENTRATION TOO LOW TO BE BENEFICIAL. THE STANDARD COMMERCIAL EXTRACTION
PROCESS BOILS DOWN 50 POUNDS OF LEAVES TO GET 1 POUND OF MEDICINAL EXTRACT.
WHEN YOU BUY GINKGO, LOOK FOR A 50:1 EXTRACT AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT.
OREGANO
OREGANO, ONCE PRESCRIBED BY
CHINESE PHYSICIANS TO TREAT FEVER
AND OTHER CONDITIONS, HAS
PROVED TO BE IVELL-ENDOWED WITH
ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
^OL
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
V HORSERADISH (ARMORACIA RUSTIC ANA). I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN HORSERADISH (AND JAPANESE WASABI) FOR CLEARING THE SINUSES. YOU MIGHT TRY A STRAIGHT
SPOONFUL OF GROUND HORSERADISH IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY BRAVE, OR YOU CAN ADD THIS HOT
HERB TO MY SINUSOUP.
V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). BROMELAIN, A COMPOUND FOUND IN
PINEAPPLE, IS USEFUL FOR TREATING SINUSITIS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL
PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D., CO-AUTHOR OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
COMMON NATURAL INGREDIENTS.
NATUROPATHS SAY THAT COMBINING 250 TO 500 MILLIGRAMS OF PURE BROMELAIN WITH
GOLDENSEAL ENHANCES THE HERB'S ALREADY POTENT EFFECTIVENESS. I ENJOY PINEAPPLE AND
ITS JUICE, SO FD PROBABLY CHASE MY GOLDENSEAL CAPSULE WITH THE JUICE RATHER THAN
TAKING A BROMELAIN PILL.
SKIN PROBLEMS
E
VERY WINTER, THE BASEBOARD HOT-WATER RADIATORS IN OUR HOME MAKE THE
AIR VERY DRY. AND EVERY YEAR, I DEVELOP A SKIN IRRITATION THAT I CALL DRY
WINTER DERMATITIS. OVER THE YEARS, I'VE FOUND A SKIN LOTION THAT HELPS. ITS INGREDIENTS ARE WATER, GLYCERIN AND ALOE VERA, THE TRADITIONAL AND VERY EFFECTIVE HERBAL
TREATMENT FOR MANY SKIN PROBLEMS. THAT'S MY PERSONAL GREEN PHARMACY SUCCESS
STORY.
I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION A CASE REPORT PUBLISHED IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL
JOURNAL LANCET. IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A PHYSICIAN WHO MOVED FROM A HUMID
SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE TO A VERY DRY DESERT AREA. HE DEVELOPED A SEVERE DRY-SKIN
RASH ON HIS HANDS. HE TRIED STEROIDS, MEDICATIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES PRESCRIBED
TO HEAL SEVERE RASHES. THEY DIDN'T HELP, SO HE DECIDED THAT HE'D JUST HAVE TO LIVE
WITH IT.
FOUR YEARS LATER, SEVERAL STUDIES APPEARED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE SHOWING
THAT VITAMIN E REDUCES HEART ATTACK RISK BY SOME 35 PERCENT IN MEN. BECAUSE
HE WAS AT RISK, THE DOCTOR BEGAN TAKING 4O0 INTERNATIONAL UNITS OF VITAMIN E A
DAY FOR HIS HEART. IT ALSO HELPED HIS SKIN. IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS, HIS FOUR-YEAROLD SKIN RASH CLEARED UP.
VITAMIN E IS WIDELY TOUTED FOR SKIN PROBLEMS, AND IT'S AN INGREDIENT IN MANY
SKIN CREAMS AND COSMETICS. BUT LIKE MANY PHYSICIANS, THIS DOCTOR WAS SKEPTICAL
392
SKIN PROBLEMS
OF SUCH SUPPLEMENT CLAIMS AND WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT HE ACTUALLY HAD VITAMIN
E TO THANK FOR RESOLVING HIS DERMATITIS. THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HOWEVER, WHILE ON A
WINTER VACATION, THE DOCTOR DISCONTINUED HIS VITAMIN E, AND HIS DERMATITIS RETURNED. ON RETURNING HOME, AFTER TWO WEEKS WITHOUT THE SUPPLEMENTS, HE BEGAN
TAKING THEM AGAIN, AND HIS RASH CLEARED UP AGAIN. THAT MADE A BELIEVER OF HIM.
ALLOW ME TO TELL YOU ONE MORE STORY BEFORE WE GET TO THE HERBS. A VIDEOGRAPHER WHO WORKED WITH ME IN THE AMAZON DEVELOPED A STRANGE AND VERY ITCHY
ECZEMA WHILE IN THE RAIN FOREST. A SHAMANISTIC HEALER I KNEW SUGGESTED THAT SHE
APPLY A POULTICE OF CRUSHED PETALS OF PERUVIAN RED HIBISCUS. THE TREATMENT
WORKED.
ODDLY, WHEN THE VIDEOGRAPHER RETURNED HOME TO CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA, HER ECZEMA RETURNED, AND NOTHING HER PHYSICIAN OFFERED GAVE HER ANY RELIEF. SHE CONTINUES TO IMPORT HIBISCUS FROM PERU, SINCE IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT IS
EFFECTIVE. IN A PINCH, THOUGH, SHE COULD SPLASH RED ZINGER TEA ON HER RASH. THE
RED COLOR OF THIS COMMERCIAL, MIXED-HERB TEA COMES FROM HIBISCUS FLOWERS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SKIN PROBLEMS
FORTUNATELY, AS THE STORIES ABOVE DEMONSTRATE, HERBAL APPROACHES HAVE A
GREAT DEAL TO OFFER THOSE WITH SKIN PROBLEMS. IN SOME CASES, THE HERBS HELP EVEN
WHEN PHARMACEUTICALS DO NOT. HERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE MOST HELPFUL HERBS.
W * ALOE (ALOE VERA). ALOE HAS BEEN USED SINCE THE DAYS OF EGYPT'S ANCIENT
PHARAOHS TO TREAT ALL MANNER OF SKIN PROBLEMS. BUT ALOE IS MORE THAN AN AGE-OLD
FOLK REMEDY. SINCE THE 1930S, WHEN THE GEL INSIDE ALOE'S LEATHERY LEAVES WAS
SHOWN TO SPEED THE HEALING OF RADIATION BURNS, MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS HERB
TO BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING A VARIETY OF SKIN PROBLEMS. IN ONE STUDY OF PEOPLE UNDERGOING DERMABRASION, A MEDICAL PROCEDURE INVOLVING REMOVAL OF THE TOP LAYER
OF SKIN, ALOE SPEEDED HEALING BY 72 HOURS.
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A BROWN THUMB, ALOE IS EASY TO MAINTAIN AS A POTTED PLANT.
IT REQUIRES LITTLE WATER AND ALMOST NO CARE. FOR MINOR BURNS, CUTS AND OTHER SKIN
PROBLEMS, SIMPLY SNIP OFF A LOWER LEAF, SLIT IT OPEN LENGTHWISE, SCOOP OUT THE
GELATINOUS PULP AND APPLY IT TO THE AFFECTED AREA. OR TRY ONE OF THE MANY COMMERCIAL SKIN PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN THIS HERB.
V\V EVENING PRIMROSE {OENOTHERA BIENNIS). EVENING PRIMROSE OIL
(EPO) IS RICH IN A COMPOUND CALLED GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA), WHICH IS APPROVED IN GREAT BRITAIN FOR TREATING ECZEMA. RESEARCH I'VE REVIEWED SUPPORTS THIS
USE AND SUGGESTS THAT THIS HERBAL OIL IS ALSO HELPFUL IN TREATING OTHER FORMS OF SKIN
IRRITATION (DERMATITIS).
ALTHOUGH EVENING PRIMROSE IS A WEED AT MY PLACE, I BUY EPO IN CAPSULES
AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE, AND I SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO TAKE THIS
393
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HERB. TAKE THE CAPSULES ORALLY, FOLLOWING THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. YOU CAN ALSO
TAKE OILS OF BORAGE, CURRANT AND HOPS, WHICH ARE ALSO WELL-ENDOWED WITH GLA.
AS WITH EVENING PRIMROSE, YOU CAN GET THESE OTHER OILS IN CAPSULE FORM; FOLLOW
THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU TAKE THEM.
^ ^ . AVOCADO (PER&EA AMERICANA). THERE'S MORE TO AVOCADO THAN GUACAMOLE. ITS OIL IS ACTUALLY PATENTED AS A TREATMENT FOR SOME FORMS OF DERMATITIS AND
ARTHRITIS. ACCORDING TO AUBREY HAMPTON, AUTHOR OF NATURAL ORGANIC HAIR AND SKIN
CARE, LONG-TERM TREATMENT WITH AVOCADO OIL HELPS RELIEVE ECZEMA. I'M NOT SURPRISED, AS AVOCADO OIL IS RICH IN VITAMINS A, D AND E, ALL OF WHICH HELP MAINTAIN
HEALTHY SKIN. I SUGGEST APPLYING IT DIRECDY TO ANY ITCHY, RED OR IRRITATED AREAS. IT
MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL TO INGEST THE OIL AND USE IT IN SALAD DRESSINGS.
VV CALENDULA {CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). SMALL WONDER THAT THIS PRETTY
FLOWER HAS A FOLK REPUTATION FOR TREATING ALL KINDS OF SKIN PROBLEMS. RESEARCH
SHOWS THAT THIS HERB IS ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTIFUNGAL, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTIVIRAL.
CALENDULA ALSO STIMULATES WHITE BLOOD CELLS TO GOBBLE UP HARMFUL MICROBES AND
HELPS SPEED WOUND HEALING. I USUALLY BUY COMMERCIAL CALENDULA FLOWER OINTMENTS AND APPLY THEM AS NEEDED. THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO USE THIS HERB AS A SKIN
TREATMENT.
VV CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). DON'T JUST DRINK YOUR CAMOMILE
TEA—BREW IT STRONG AND USE IT IN A COMPRESS FOR TREATING SKIN PROBLEMS. THIS
TASTY HERB IS APPROVED IN EUROPE FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATORY SKIN CONDITIONS,
NOTABLY YEAST INFECTIONS. COMPOUNDS IN CAMOMILE (BISABOLOL, CHAMAZULENE AND
CYCLIC ETHERS) ARE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, BACTERICIDAL AND FUNGICIDAL.
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU TRY IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION. IF
IT SEEMS TO HELP, GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE
ITCHING OR IRRITATION, DISCONTINUE USE.
^ V CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS). COOL AS A CUCUMBER? THAT'S NOT JUST A
FIGURE OF SPEECH. PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG,
PH.D., REMINDS US THAT CUCUMBER HAS A LONG FOLK HISTORY OF USE FOR SOOTHING DERMATITIS AND BURNS AND FOR TREATING WRINKLES. IF I HAD A SKIN PROBLEM, I'D PEEL AND
BLEND SOME CUCUMBERS IN MY BLENDER, WITH OR WITHOUT AVOCADO, AND APPLY THE
PUREE DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA, LEAVING IT ON FOR 15 TO 60 MINUTES.
VV GOTU KOLA (CENTEUA ASIATICA). THIS HERB, NATIVE TO INDIA, STIMULATES
THE REGENERATION OF SKIN CELLS AND UNDERLYING CONNECTIVE TISSUE. IN CLINICAL
TRIALS, GOTU KOLA HAS PROVEN USEFUL IN TREATING ECZEMA, WOUNDS AND OTHER SKIN
CONDITIONS. THE LATEST RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT ONE COMPOUND (ASIATICOSIDE) IN
GOTU KOLA IS AMONG THE MOST PROMISING TREATMENTS FOR ONE OF HISTORY'S MOST DEV394
SKIN PROBLEM S
ASTATING SKIN DISEASES, LEPROSY. IF 1 DEVELOPED A SKIN PROBLEM IN THE TROPICS, I'D
USE CRUSHED LEAVES TO MAKE A POULTICE AND APPLY IT TO THE AFFECTED AREAS. HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES, THE LEAVES ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE, SO I'D BUY A COMMERCIAL TINCTURE AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
V> WILD PANSY (VIOLA TRICOLOR)., THIS IS A TRADITIONAL HERBAL TREATMENT FOR
ACNE, ECZEMA, IMPETIGO, ITCHING AND OTHER SKIN PROBLEMS. AND MODERN RESEARCH
SUPPORTS USING THIS HERB AS A TREATMENT FOR SKIN PROBLEMS. GERMANY'S COMMISSION
E, THE EXPERT PANEL THAT JUDGES THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HERBAL MEDICINES,
APPROVES OF USING PANSY TEA AS A SKIN TREATMENT. YOU CAN MAKE A TEA WITH ABOUT
ONE TEASPOON OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER, STEEP IT FOR TEN MINUTES.
W WITCH HAZEL (HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA). WITCH HAZEL CONTAINS GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF TANNINS, POTENT ASTRINGENTS THAT ARE USEFUL IN TREATING SKIN PROBLEMS. ACCORDING TO STUDIES WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS, WITCH HAZEL ALSO INCREASES THE
TONE OF THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE SKIN, WHICH ENHANCES BLOOD SUPPLY TO DAMAGED AREAS. ONE SUNBURN STUDY COMPARED THREE PREPARATIONS: A
COMBINATION OF ASTRINGENT WITCH HAZEL AND LECITHIN,
A CAMOMILE CREAM AND A 1 PERCENT HYDROCORTISONE CREAM (A STANDARD PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY). THE HYDROCORTISONE WORKED
BEST, BUT THE WITCH HAZEL-LECITHIN COMBO RAN
A CLOSE SECOND.
COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING WITCH
HAZEL WATER EXTERNALLY FOR TREATING DERMATITIS AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT DAMAGE
THE SKIN.
V CARROL (DAUCUS CAROTA). CARROTS
ARE A RICH SOURCE OF VITAMIN A-LIKE CAROTENOIDS
THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH OF THE
SKIN AND REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE. RETIN-A, THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USED TO TREAT SEVERE ACNE, IS A
CAROTENOID PREPARATION.
SOME HERBALISTS RECOMMEND APPLYING LIQUEFIED CARROTS (AND/OR TOMATOES
AND SWEET POTATOES) TO THE SKIN TO TREAT SUNBURN AND OTHER MINOR SKIN CONDITIONS. I CAN'T SEE DOING THAT MYSELF, BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T TRY
IT IF YOU WANT. I EAT A LOT OF CARROTS AND OTHER RED AND ORANGE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BECAUSE I KNOW THAT INGESTING CAROTENOIDS NOT ONLY HELPS PREVENT SKIN
DAMAGE BUT CAN HELP WARD OFF CANCER AND HEART DISEASE AS WELL.
V ENGLISH PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO LANCEOLATA). EXTERNAL APPLICATION OF
WITCH HAZEL
WITCH HAZEL, WHICHFLOWERS BETVITCHINGLY AROUND
HALLOWEEN, IS AN INGREDIENT IN
ASTRINGENT LOTIONS.
395
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
COOLING, SOOTHING PLANTAIN LEAVES IS A TIME-HONORED HERBAL REMEDY FOR TREATING
MINOR SKIN PROBLEMS. MODERN RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT TWO COMPOUNDS (AUCUBIN
AND CATAPOL) IN PLANTAIN HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND BACTERICIDAL PROPERTIES.
V IVY (HEDERA HELIX)* COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SAPONINS, WHICH ARE FOUND
IN IVY LEAVES, ARE ACTIVE AGAINST SEVERAL BACTERIA AND FUNGI THAT CAUSE SKIN PROBLEMS. COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING IVY TO TREAT BRONCHITIS, WHICH IS AN INDICATION
OF THE HERB'S SAFETY.
IVY HAS AN EXTENSIVE FOLKLORIC REPUTATION FOR TREATING DERMATITIS. IF I HAD A
SKIN PROBLEM, I WOULD CHOP SOME LEAVES IN A BLENDER AND APPLY THE PASTE DIRECTLY TO THE AFFECTED AREA.
V MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). THIS HERB CONTAINS A SOOTHING
WATER-SOLUBLE FIBER CALLED MUCILAGE THAT HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE FOR RELIEVING SKIN
PROBLEMS. IN EUROPE, MARSH MALLOW MUCILAGE IS USED IN OINTMENTS FOR TREATING
CHAPPED SKIN. IF I HAD A SKIN PROBLEM, I'D PUT THE FRESH ROOT THROUGH MY JUICING
MACHINE, THEN APPLY THE LIQUID DIRECDY TO THE AFFECTED AREAS.
V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). ONE OF THE LATEST BUZZWORDS IN SKIN
CARE IS ALPHA-HYDROXY ACIDS (AHAS). AHAS PEEL OFF DEAD SKIN CELLS BY DISSOLVING
THE SUBSTANCES THAT HOLD THE DEAD SKIN TOGETHER.
DERMATOLOGISTS USE AHA PREPARATIONS CLINICALLY TO TREAT ACNE, CHAPPED
SKIN, FINE LINES, WRINKLES AND OTHER SKIN CONDITIONS. THEY USE STRONG CONCENTRATIONS FOR FACE PEELS, AND LOWER CONCENTRATIONS APPEAR IN DOZENS OF OVER-THECOUNTER SKIN CLEANSERS, LOTIONS AND TONERS.
WHAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW IS THAT AHAS ARE OFTEN HERBAL PRODUCTS CALLED FRUIT
ACIDS. AS THE NAME SUGGESTS, AHAS OCCUR IN MANY FRUITS, NOTABLY PINEAPPLE,
TAMARIND, GARDENIA, APPLES AND GRAPES. THEY ALSO OCCUR IN SOUR MILK. CLEOPATRA
REPORTEDLY BATHED IN SOUR MILK BECAUSE IT BROUGHT OUT THE LUSTER IN HER SKIN. I
CAN'T IMAGINE TAKING A SOUR MILK BATH, BUT I LOVE PINEAPPLE AND EAT A LOT OF IT,
AND I COULD SEE RUBBING THE INNER PEEL ON DAMAGED SKIN.
V PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). LIKE CARROTS, PURSLANE IS GENEROUSLY
ENDOWED WITH CAROTENOIDS. FM NOT THE FACIAL MASK TYPE, BUT IF I WERE, I MIGHT TRY
PUTTING A HANDFUL OF THIS USEFUL WEED INTO A BLENDER WITH A CARROT AND MAYBE EVEN
SOME PINEAPPLE. THIS WOULD CREATE AN INVIGORATING FACE MASK WITH HEALING PROPERTIES. I'D SUGGEST LEAVING IT ON FOR 20 MINUTES OR SO.
V WALNUT (JUGLANS, VARIOUS SPECIES). COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING
WALNUT LEAVES FOR TREATING MILD SUPERFICIAL SKIN INFLAMMATIONS. STEEP TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED LEAVES IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER, THEN APPLY THE TEA WHEN COOL.
SOME HERBALISTS SUGGEST ADDING A HANDFUL OF CRUSHED WALNUT LEAVES TO BATHS FOR
TREATING ECZEMA.
396
SMOKINGF
MY SON AND DAUGHTER COMPLAINED ABOUT MY SMOKING SO BITTERLY 25
YEARS AGO THAT I QUIT COLD TURKEY. ONE DAY I WAS SMOKING SOME THREE
PACKS A DAY OF UNFILTERED, KING-SIZE CIGARETTES, AND THE NEXT DAY, NONE. I OCCASIONALLY STILL HAVE DREAMS IN WHICH I GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION TO LIGHT UP AGAIN,
BUT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
QUITTING FOR GOOD. REASONS
SMOKING IS ESTIMATED TO CAUSE ONE-THIRD OF ALL CANCER DEATHS AND ONEFOURTH OF THE FATAL HEART ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT 350,000 AMERICANS DIE EVERY YEAR FROM SMOKING. (MY
OWN ESTIMATE IS 500,000.) FORTY PERCENT OF SMOKERS DIE BEFORE THEY REACH RETIREMENT AGE.
BUT ALL THE TALK ABOUT PREMATURE DEATH GOES OVER THE HEADS OF THE TEENAGERS
WHO START SMOKING AND THE YOUNG ADULTS WHO WON'T QUIT. THE HAZARDS OF
SMOKING JUST SEEM TOO FAR OFF TO THEM.
THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO REMIND YOUNG SMOKERS I KNOW THAT THE HABIT HITS MEN
IN THE PENIS AND WOMEN IN THE FACE. THAT'S RIGHT. SMOKING DAMAGES THE BLOOD
VESSELS THAT SUPPLY THE PENIS, SO MEN WHO SMOKE HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF IMPOTENCE. SMOKING ALSO DAMAGES THE CAPILLARIES IN WOMEN'S FACES, WHICH IS WHY
WOMEN SMOKERS DEVELOP WRINKLES YEARS BEFORE NONSMOKERS. (SMOKING DEVELOPS EARLY WRINKLES IN MEN'S FACES, TOO, BUT SOMEHOW THIS PARTICULAR ANTISMOKING ARGUMENT SEEMS TO SCORE MORE POINTS WITH WOMEN THAN WITH MEN.)
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SMOKING
YEARS AGO, WHEN I KICKED THE CIGARETTE HABIT, I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
HERBAL MEDICINE. IF I WERE QUITTING TODAY, I'D USE SOME HERBS TO HELP.
V V \ LICORICE (G&YCYRRHIZA GLABRA). I DON'T HAVE MUCH SCIENCE HERE, JUST A
GUT BELIEF TO BACK LICORICE AS AN ANTI-SMOKING AID. I'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT OF POSITIVE
STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE KICKING THE HABIT WITH THE HELP OF LICORICE.
HOW DOES THIS WORK? LICORICE ROOT HAPPENS TO LOOK JUST LIKE AN OLD CHEROOT CIGAR. YOU CAN KEEP A STICK OF LICORICE ROOT HANDY AND SUCK ON IT IN PLACE OF
A CIGARETTE. I BELIEVE IT WORKS BY HELPING TO SATISFY THE ORAL CRAVINGS THAT PEOPLE
WHO ARE ADDICTED TO CIGARETTES SEEM TO HAVE. IF I WERE STILL A SMOKER, I'D GIVE
THIS ONE A TRY.

TMIUNIE BENS AND HIS "YALLERROOT" CURE
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING WITH THE LATE A. L. "TOMMIE" BASS IN THE LATE FALL OF
1994, WHEN HE WAS 87, AT HIS CHEROKEE COUNTY FARMETTE JUST OUTSIDE LEESBURG, ALABAMA. BASS WAS THE ONLY HERBALIST I KNEW WHO HAD A PERMANENT OFFICIAL HIGHWAY
SIGN HONORING HIS CALLING. AS YOU APPROACHED HIS HOME, YOU ENCOUNTERED A SIGN THAT
READ: ARTHUR LEE 'TOMMIE" BASS, HERBALIST, 0.5 MILE.
ON THE DAY I VISITED, TOMMIE ALSO HAD A SIGN SET UP IN FRONT OF HIS SHACK. IT
ANNOUNCED YELLOWROOT AT $1.25 A BUNCH AND PRICKLY ASH BARK AT $5 A BUNCH.
IT WAS A GENUINE PLEASURE FOR ME TO VISIT CHEROKEE COUNTY, BECAUSE I WAS
BORN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES AWAY, IN JEFFERSON COUNTY, BACK IN 1929. BY THE TIME
I WAS BORN, TOMMIE WAS ALREADY 21 AND HAD BEEN COLLECTING AND SELLING HERBS FOR
II YEARS.
I WAS WITH SOME FRIENDS FROM SAMFORD UNIVERSITY IN BIRMINGHAM ON THIS VISIT
TO THIS GENUINE OLD-TIME ALABAMA FOLK HERBALIST. WE TRIED CALLING HIM AHEAD OF
TIME, BUT OUR PHONE CALLS WENT UNANSWERED. SO WE JUST JUMPED IN THE CAR AND
DROVE UP, ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES FROM BIRMINGHAM, HOPING HE'D BE AROUND. IT WAS
A DANK, DARK, DRIZZLY DAY, AND WE FOUND HIM IN HIS LITTLE SHACK, A DISORGANIZED COLLECTION OF UNEVEN BOARDS TACKED TOGETHER. ALTHOUGH WE ARRIVED UNANNOUNCED,
TOMMIE CAME OUT AND GREETED US WARMLY.
I WAS PLEASED TO SEE TOMMIE'S BUNDLES OF YELLOWROOT (XANTHORRHIZA SIMPLICISSIMA\ WHICH RESEMBLED YELLOWISH SWITCHES, AS WE WALKED TOWARD HIS HOUSE. HE
WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT, SAYING THAT IT WAS THE BEST TONIC HERB HE KNEW. HE PRONOUNCED IT "YALL ERROOT
-"
TOMMIE CLAIMED THAT WITH THIS HERB HE'D HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH ULCERS
ABANDON THEIR TAGAMET. HE CONSIDERED IT TOPS FOR WHAT HE CALLED UPSTAIRS HERNIA, BY
WHICH HE PROBABLY MEANT EITHER HIATAL HERNIA OR THE HEARTBURN ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
FINALLY, TOMMIE SAID, TUCKING ONE OF THE BITTER ROOTS IN HIS MOUTH, YELLOWROOT
IS A REAL HELP IN QUITTING SMOKING.
AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC BACKING WHATSOEVER FOR USING TOMMIE'S
"YALLERROOT" TO HELP KICK THE SMOKING HABIT. BUT WHEN I HEAR AN OLD-TIME HERBALIST
LIKE TOMMIE ENDORSE IT, I SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR
TOMMIE'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AFTER ALL, HE HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO GAIN BY PROMOTING YELLOWROOT. WHEN HE SAID THAT HE HELPED MANY PEOPLE QUIT SMOKING WITH
IT, I BELIEVED HIM. AND ANYWAY, IT PROBABLY CAN'T HURT TO GIVE IT A TRY. YOU CAN BREW
UP YELLOWROOT AS A TEA OR CHEW ON THE BITTER TWIG LIKE A LICORICE ROOT. IT MIGHT PREVENT CAVITIES, TOO.
398
SMOKIN G
IT'S INTERESTING THAT MOST LICORICE COMING TO THE UNITED STATES GOES INTO TOBACCO PRODUCTS—CHEWING TOBACCO AND PIPE TOBACCO.
YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WHILE LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL
USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS—UP TO ABOUT THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY—LONG-TERM USE
(MORE THAN SIX WEEKS) OR INGESTION OF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM
AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
W * RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE). A FEW YEARS BACK, I GOT A CALL FROM
AN ENTREPRENEUR LOOKING FOR A SOURCE OF 50 TONS OF RED CLOVER. HE WANTED IT AS A
MAJOR INGREDIENT IN A TOBACCO-FREE CHEWING TOBACCO PRODUCT HE WANTED TO MARKET,
ALL TINNED UP JUST LIKE THE REAL THING.
I GOT THIS CALL RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT I LEARNED
ABOUT WHY RED CLOVER HAS AN AGE-OLD REPUTATION AS A
CANCER PREVENTER. FOR TUMORS TO GROW, THEY NEED A
BLOOD SUPPLY, AND THEY SEND OUT BIOCHEMICAL SIGNALS
THAT COAX THE BODY INTO GROWING BLOOD VESSELS RIGHT
INTO THEM, A PROCESS CALLED ANGIOGENESIS.
SEVERAL LEADING CANCER RESEARCHERS HAVE
BEEN WORKING ON WAYS TO STOP THESE NEW BLOOD
VESSELS FROM FORMING, THEREBY STARVING TUMORS.
IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE COMPOUND WITH AN ANTI-ANGIOGENIC EFFECT IS GENISTEIN, A CONSTITUENT OF RED
CLOVER.
SO I WELCOMED THE CALL FROM THE MAN
SEEKING RED CLOVER. BY REPLACING CHEWING TOBACCO WITH A NONTOBACCO SUBSTITUTE, HE WAS
WORKING TO PREVENT THE MOUTH AND TONGUE CANCER
THAT CHEWING TOBACCO CAUSES. AND BY REPLACING
TOBACCO WITH RED CLOVER, HE WAS UNWITTINGLY PROVIDING ANTI-ANGIOGENIC BENEFITS AS WELL.
I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER BECAME OF THE MAN'S
TOBACCO-FREE RED CLOVER CHAW, BUT I HAVE A TIN OF
RED CLOVER—BASED SNUFF. ASPIRING EX-SMOKERS
CAN CHEW ON FRESH CLOVER FLOWERS (YOU CAN ADD
THEM TO SALADS) OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONTAINS
GENISTEIN, SUCH AS GROUNDNUTS, PEANUTS OR SOYBEANS. THESE MUNCHIES WOULD
HELP SATISFY SOME OF THE ORAL NEEDS THAT SMOKERS AND EX-SMOKERS SEEM TO HAVE.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GENISTEIN IN THESE SNACKS WOULD BE ATTACKING ANY TUMORS
THAT MIGHT BE TRYING TO GET A START.
RED CLOVER
THE FLOWERS OF RED CLOVER,
WHICH WERE WIDELY USED FOR
DECADES IN FOLK REMEDIES FOR
CANCER, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO
CONTAIN THE ANTI-CANCER
COMPOUND GENISTEIN.
399
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
IF YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME KICKING THE SMOKING HABIT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO
DEVELOP ANOTHER HABIT—DRINKING RED CLOVER TEA DAILY. IT SEEMS AS IF IT WOULD
OFFER A MEASURE OF PROTECTION.
VV CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). BACK WHEN I QUIT SMOKING, CARROTS HELPED
ME QUITE A BIT. I USED TO DRIVE TO THE OFFICE MUNCHING ON A RAW CARROT OR TWO INSTEAD OF PUFFING ON A CIGARETTE.
AT THE TIME, I CHOSE CARROTS BECAUSE I LIKE THEM, BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT
CAROTENOIDS, THE CHEMICAL RELATIVES OF VITAMIN A THAT GIVE CARROTS THEIR ORANGE
COLOR, ALSO HELP PREVENT CANCER, ESPECIALLY IF THE CAROTENOIDS COME FROM CARROTS OR OTHER WHOLE FOODS RATHER THAN FROM CAPSULES. (GENERALLY, IF YOU ISOLATE
ONE BENEFICIAL CHEMICAL—TAKE IT OUT OF CONTEXT—YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON A WHOLE
LOT OF OTHER CHEMISTRY THAT CAN ALSO HELP.)
IF CIGARETTES ARE CANCER STICKS, CARROTS ARE ANSI-CANCER STICKS. IN FACT, ALL
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE. THE RESEARCH IS CONSISTENT AND COMPELLING: THE MORE
FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PEOPLE EAT, THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO DEVELOP EVERY MAJOR
CANCER, INCLUDING LUNG CANCER. SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T QUIT SMOKING, YOU SHOULD
STILL BE MUNCHING ON CARROTS.
SORES
I
WANT TO OPEN THIS CHAPTER WITH A COUPLE OF REMARKABLE STORIES OF JUST
WHAT HERBS CAN DO WHEN IT COMES TO HEALING SORES.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHOSE FATHER HAS DIABETES. LIKE MANY PEOPLE WITH DIABETES,
HE DEVELOPED FOOT PROBLEMS TO THE POINT WHERE HIS DOCTOR ADVISED AMPUTATING
ONE OF HIS TOES, WHICH HAD BECOME SERIOUSLY ULCERATED. MY FRIEND CAME TO ME
AND ASKED IF I KNEW OF ANY HERBAL ALTERNATIVES TO HELP HER FATHER AVOID SUCH A
DRASTIC MEASURE.
IN MY USUAL CAUTIOUS WAY, I TOLD HER THAT AS A BOTANIST I DO NOT PRESCRIBE.
BUT I ADDED THAT BEFORE I HAD A TOE AMPUTATED, I'D TRY COMFREY, EITHER AS A POULTICE OR A STRONG WASH, TO TREAT THE DIABETIC ULCER. AFTER MY FRIEND'S FATHER USED
THE COMFREY WASH FOR JUST A WEEK, SHE REPORTED, HIS TOE IMPROVED REMARKABLY.
HIS DOCTOR CANCELED PLANS FOR THE AMPUTATION.
HERE'S ANOTHER TRUE STORY: A TELEVISION CREW OUT OF BALTIMORE WAS DOING A
FEATURE ON MEDICINAL HERBS IN MY HERB GARDEN ONE FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE INTERVIEWER SPOTTED SOME COMFREY AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS GOOD FOR. I ANSWERED,
400
SORES
"SORES AND OTHER WOUNDS, ESPECIALLY INDOLENT ULCERS—THAT IS, SLOW-HEALING
SORES."
I STARTED TO MOVE ON, BUT THEN I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD AN INDOLENT ULCER
ON MY RIGHT SHIN. IT WAS A SORE, SCABBED OVER, WITH RAISED EDGES, THAT WASN'T
GETTING ANY WORSE BUT CERTAINLY WASN'T SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF HEALING, EITHER. IT
HAD REMAINED BASICALLY THE SAME FOR WEEKS.
WITH THE CAMERAS WHIRRING, I RAISED THE LEG OF MY BLUE JEANS AND REVEALED
THE SORE. THEN I RUBBED IT WITH SOME FRESH COMFREY LEAVES THAT I HAD CRUSHED
AND BALLED UP IN MY HAND. THE ABRADED SORE STARTED BLEEDING. WITH THE CAMERAS STILL WHIRRING, I GRABBED SOME ASTRINGENT GERANIUM AND RUBBED IT ON TO STOP
THE BLEEDING. IT WORKED. WE MOVED ON TO OTHER HERBS, BUT JUST THREE DAYS LATER,
THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, THE SORE HAD HEALED OVER.
I WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED THAT STORY IF IT HAD NOT HAPPENED TO ME. AS A SCIENTIST, I CAN'T BE CERTAIN WHETHER THE HEALING CAME FROM THE COMFREY, ITS ABRASIVE APPLICATION, THE SUNSHINE, THE GERANIUM, THE COMFREY-GERANIUM COMBINATION OR JUST GOOD LUCK. BUT YOU CAN BET YOUR BOTTOM DOLLAR THAT THE NEXT
TIME I AM FACED WITH A STUBBORN SORE OF ANY KIND, I'LL VENTURE BACK TO MY HERB
GARDEN FOR COMFREY AND GERANIUM.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SORES
OKAY. I'VE SAID MY PIECE AND I'VE MADE MY POINT. I NEED ADD ONLY THAT
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS IN ADDITION TO COMFREY THAT CAN BE USED TO TREAT
SORES.
V \ \ CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). COMMISSION E, THE GROUP OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, ENDORSES CALENDULA AS EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING INFLAMMATION AND SPEEDING THE HEALING OF SORES. THE FLOWERS
ARE USED EXTERNALLY IN INFUSIONS, OINTMENTS AND TINCTURES. CALENDULA ALSO HELPS
PREVENT STAPHYLOCOCCUS INFECTION.
A WHILE BACK, WEST VIRGINIA HERBALIST JIM FOLTZ GAVE ME SOME CALENDULA
SALVE. LIKE COMMISSION E, FOLTZ FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THIS HERB IS GOOD FOR
TREATING SORES. I FOUND OUT HOW GOOD WHILE ON A TRIP TO THE AMAZON. TO SHOW
SOME WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS HOW THE PERUVIAN BUM-TREE GOT ITS NAME, I TIED A
PIECE OF THE TREE'S INNER BARK AROUND MY RIGHT ANKLE. SOON I HAD A CIRCULAR BURN
WHERE THE BARK HAD CONTACTED MY SKIN. LATER ON, THE BURN BLISTERED AND BECAME SOMEWHAT INFECTED. THAT WAS WHEN I APPLIED SOME CALENDULA SALVE AND
DISCOVERED HOW WELL IT WORKED. THE BURNED AREA HEALED QUITE NICELY.
YOU CAN BUY A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL CREAMS AND OINTMENTS CONTAINING
CALENDULA. FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.

A COMPOUND THAT PROMOTES NEW CELL GROWTH. IN ADDITION, ALLANTOIN IS AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAT STIMULATES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. THE ASTRINGENT TANNINS IN THE
PLANT MAY ALSO HELP.
PM NOT SURE IF COMFREY IS A SCOUNDREL OR A SUPERSTAR. IT HAS BEEN VILIFIED
BY EXPERTS WHO POINT OUT THAT IT CONTAINS CARCINOGENIC COMPOUNDS CALLED
PYRROLIZIDINE ALKALOIDS THAT CAN CAUSE SEVERE LIVER DAMAGE IF THE HERB IS INGESTED. BUT OTHER EXPERTS PRAISE ITS POWERS, WHEN IT'S USED EXTERNALLY, FOR
SPEEDING THE HEALING OF SORES AND CUTS, INCLUDING SURGICAL INCISIONS.
I THINK THAT THERE IS GOOD REASON TO USE COMFREY EXTERNALLY, AND LITTLE HAZARD
IN DOING SO. I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE RISK OF HAZARD IF YOU INGEST IT.
BUT WARNINGS ABOUT INTERNAL CONSUMPTION SHOULDN'T STOP US FROM GETTING IT. WE
WOULD LOSE A FINE MEDICINAL HERB IF WE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE BULLIED OUT OF
USING COMFREY EXTERNALLY SIMPLY BECAUSE INGESTING IT MAY BE HAZARDOUS.
YOU CAN USE FRESH COMFREY AS A POULTICE OR MAKE A STRONG TEA TO USE AS A
WASH. FOR TREATING MORE SERIOUS LEG ULCERS, RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D., THE DEAN
OF GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE, RECOMMENDS
USING A LEAF OR ROOT POULTICE FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS. AFTER THAT, YOU CAN SWITCH TO
COMFREY OINTMENT OR MAKE A COMFREY PASTE AND COVER IT WITH A FIRM COMPRESSION BANDAGE.
V"*^ DRAGON'S BLOOD (CROTON LECHLERI). THIS IS ONE OF THE RISING HERBAL
SUPERSTARS FROM AMAZONIA. WIDELY AVAILABLE IN LATIN AMERICA, IT'S STILL PRETTY HARD
TO FIND IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL BECOME MORE AVAILABLE
HERE SOON.
DRAGON'S BLOOD IS THE SOURCE OF TWO DRUGS NOW IN CLINICAL TRIALS SPONSORED
BY SHAMAN PHARMACEUTICALS, THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM THAT
HAS BEEN WORKING WITH NATIVE HEALERS IN THE THIRD WORLD. UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE
MOST DRUG COMPANIES, SHAMAN PHARMACEUTICALS IS GOING FOR ISOLATED CHEMICAL
EXTRACTS—THE "MAGIC BULLET" APPROACH—RATHER THAN USING THE WHOLE HERBAL
PRODUCT.
MY PERUVIAN SHAMAN FRIEND ANTONIO MONTERO PISCO RECOMMENDS USING
WHOLE DRAGON'S BLOOD RATHER THAN ANY OF ITS ISOLATED COMPOUNDS. I AGREE. WHEN
I'M IN TROPICAL PERU, I USE THE WHOLE HERB IMMEDIATELY WHENEVER I GET A CUT OR
ABRASION.
W CAMOMILE {MATRICARIA RECUTITA). MOST AMERICANS THINK OF THIS HERB
AS A PLEASANT BEVERAGE TEA, WHICH IT CAN BE. BUT CAMOMILE IS ALSO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, IMMUNE-STIMULATING AND ANTISEPTIC. IT'S WIDELY USED IN EUROPE TO TREAT LEG
ULCERS.
THE PREFERRED PREPARATION IS A CAMOMILE EXTRACT, BUT USING COMPRESSES
4.07
SORES
SOAKED IN A STRONG TEA WOULD BE A CLOSE APPROXIMATION. TO MAKE THE TEA, PUT A
LARGE HANDFUL OF FRESH CAMOMILE FLOWERS OR SEVERAL TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB IN A
CUP AND COVER WITH BOILING WATER. LET THE TEA COOL, THEN STRAIN IT AND APPLY WITH
A STERILE CLOTH (A CLOTH BANDAGE WORKS NICELY).
IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD USE CAMOMILE PRODUCTS CAUTIOUSLY. CAMOMILE IS A MEMBER OF THE RAGWEED FAMILY, AND IN SOME PEOPLE, IT
MIGHT TRIGGER ALLERGIC REACTIONS. THE FIRST TIME YOU USE IT, WATCH YOUR REACTION.
IF IT SEEMS TO HELP, GO AHEAD AND USE IT. BUT IF IT SEEMS TO CAUSE OR AGGRAVATE
ITCHING OR IRRITATION, SIMPLY DISCONTINUE USE.
W COUNTRY MALLOW (SIDA CORDIFOUA), THE LEAVES OF THIS WIRY PERENNIAL
WEED CONTAIN A WATER-SOLUBLE FIBER CALLED MUCILAGE, WHICH HELPS SOOTHE SORES
WHEN APPLIED IN A POULTICE. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO UNPUBLISHED RESEARCH THAT
I'M FAMILIAR WITH, THE PLANT ALSO SEEMS TO POSSESS BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTISEPTIC
POWERS, WHICH WOULD BE HELPFUL IN TREATING SORES.
'W GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). THE GERMANS USE LARGE ORAL DOSES OF
GINKGO TO TREAT LEG ULCERS, REPORTEDLY WITH GOOD RESULTS AND NO TOXICITY. I WOULD
TRY IT. TO USE THIS HERB, YOU'LL NEED TO BUY A 50:1 EXTRACT AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE.
(ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT PRESENT IN HIGH ENOUGH CONCENTRATIONS IN THE FRESH
LEAVES TO WARRANT USING THEM.) YOU CAN TRY 60 TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T
GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS, GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
W TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). I'M JUST ONE OF A GROWING
NUMBER OF HERBALISTS WHO NOW CARRY TEATREE OIL IN MY FIRST-AID KIT, READY FOR USE AS
A HANDY ANTISEPTIC. I'M CONVINCED THAT IT'S A GOOD ONE. TEATREE OIL HAS BEEN SHOWN
EFFECTIVE AGAINST A BROAD RANGE OF BACTERIA.
SINCE SOME PEOPLE FIND TEATREE OIL IRRITATING TO THE SKIN, I SUGGEST DILUTING IT BY
ADDING SEVERAL DROPS TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF ANY VEGETABLE OIL. IF THIS IRRITATES YOUR SKIN, DISCONTINUE USE. JUST DON'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL OILS,
INTERNALLY. THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF MANY
OF THEM CAN BE POISONOUS.
V GOTU KOLA (CENTELLA ASTATIC A). IN CLINICAL TRIALS IN BRAZIL AND ELSEWHERE, GOTU KOLA HAS PROVEN USEFUL IN TREATING SKIN ULCERS, SURGICAL WOUNDS, GANGRENE, SKIN GRAFTS AND TRAUMATIC SKIN INJURIES. THE HERB WORKS BY STIMULATING
REGROWTH OF NORMAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE THAT UNDERLIES THE SKIN. THE ACTIVE
CONSTITUENT APPEARS TO BE ASIATIC ACID. I'D SUGGEST USING ONE OF THE STANDARDIZED
EXTRACTS OF GOTU KOLA THAT ARE SOLD HERE.
TO USE THE EXTRACT EXTERNALLY, SOAK A COTTON BALL IN THE LIQUID AND WIPE IT
OVER THE AFFECTED AREA. YOU CAN ALSO DRINK GOTU KOLA: MAKE A TEA FOLLOWING THE
INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE OR BOTTLE.
403
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
V TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). TEA CONTAINS MANY OF THE SAME COMPOUNDS
THAT ARE FOUND IN DRAGON'S BLOOD. IT'S ANTISEPTIC AND ASTRINGENT AND HELPS PROMOTE
SKIN HEALING. YOU CAN HAVE A CUP OF TEA AND THEN LAY THE MOIST, SPENT TEA BAG ON
YOUR SORE.
SORE THROAT
I
'M NOT NECESSARILY FOND OF LAWYERS, BUT I HOLD MY LAWYER SON-IN-LAW IN
HIGH REGARD. ON ONE VISIT, HE ARRIVED WITH A RAGING SORE THROAT. THE OVERTHE-COUNTER THROAT LOZENGES THAT HE WAS USING WERE NOT HELPING, SO I GAVE HIM
SOME SLIPPERY ELM CAPSULES. THEY DID THE TRICK. (IF THEY HADN'T, I WOULD HAVE
URGED HIM TO TAKE SOME LICORICE AS WELL, BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I ADD TO MY OWN TEA
WHENEVER FM TREATING MYSELF FOR SORE THROAT.)
ALTHOUGH SLIPPERY ELM GROWS NEARBY, I RARELY COLLECT THE BARK. IT'S EASIER
TO BUY THE PREPARED MATERIAL.
SORE THROAT IS A TYPICAL FIRST SYMPTOM OF COLDS. (MANY OF THE HERBAL SUGGESTIONS IN THE CHAPTER ON COLDS AND FLU ON PAGE 133 APPLY HERE AS WELL.) BUT SORE
THROAT MAY ALSO BE CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL IRRITANTS OR BY STREPTOCOCCUS BACTERIA (STREP THROAT). IF YOU DEVELOP A SORE THROAT WITH A FEVER AND NO
OTHER SYMPTOMS, IT MIGHT BE STREP, AND A VISIT TO THE DOCTOR IS STRONGLY ADVISED.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SORE THROAT
MOST COMMERCIAL SORE THROAT TREATMENTS INVOLVE SUCKING ON ANESTHETIC
LOZENGES THAT DEADEN THE NERVE CELLS IN THE THROAT SO THAT YOU DON'T FEEL THE
PAIN. I PREFER THE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES, WHICH ACTUALLY SOOTHE INFLAMED TISSUE.
HERE ARE THE HERBS THAT CAN HELP.
VW EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS). COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS, APPROVES USING EUCALYPTUS TO TREAT SORE THROAT.
EUCALYPTUS HELPS IN TWO WAYS. THE AROMATIC OIL HAS A COOLING EFFECT ON INFLAMED TISSUE, AND THE TANNINS IN EUCALYPTUS EXERT SOOTHING ASTRINGENT ACTION
AS WELL. I SUGGEST USING A FEW TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED LEAF PER CUP OF BOILING WATER
TO MAKE A SOOTHING TEA.
V*V HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA JAPONICA). THE CHINESE USE HONEYSUCKLE
FLOWERS EXTENSIVELY TO TREAT SORE THROAT, COLDS, FLU, TONSILLITIS, BRONCHITIS AND PNEU404
SORE THROAT
HONEYSUCKLE
THE FLOWERS OF THIS PLANT CONTAIN
SOME TWO DOZEN ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS AND ARE WIDELY USED FOR
RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS.
MONIA. IN ONE STUDY OF 425 CHINESE STUDENTS WITH
STREP THROATS, POSITIVE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED WITH A
TREATMENT THAT INVOLVED BLOWING POWDERED DRIED
HONEYSUCKLE FLOWERS, BLACKBERRY LILY ROOTS AND A
SMALL AMOUNT OF BORNEOL INTO THE BACKS OF THEIR
THROATS. (BORNEOL IS JUST ONE OF MORE THAN 20 ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS FOUND IN HONEYSUCKLE FLOWERS.)
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU NEED TO USE POWDERED
HONEYSUCKLE TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THIS HERB. HONEYSUCKLE FLOWER EXTRACTS ARE STRONGLY ACTIVE
AGAINST MANY MICROORGANISMS THAT CAUSE SORE
THROAT AND RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS.
I PERSONALLY LIKE USING HONEYSUCKLE IN COMBINATION WITH FORSYTHIA FLOWERS FOR MY OWN SORE
THROATS, AND I OFTEN TAKE THEM IN HOT LEMONADE
SWEETENED WITH LICORICE, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER.
W%, LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). LICORICE HAS BEEN REVERED AS A SORE
THROAT TREATMENT FOR CENTURIES IN BOTH EUROPE AND CHINA.
COMMISSION E APPROVES LICORICE FOR TREATING SORE THROAT, AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D.
DR. LEUNG RECOMMENDS STARTING WITH THREE CUPS OF WATER AND FIVE TO SEVEN
TEASPOONS OF ROOT PIECES. PUT THE HERB IN THE WATER AND BRING IT TO A BOIL, THEN
SIMMER UNTIL ABOUT HALF OF THE WATER HAS BOILED AWAY.
LICORICE NOT ONLY SOOTHES A SORE THROAT, IT ALSO HAS AN EXPECTORANT EFFECT
THAT CAN HELP TREAT COLDS AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS. (LIKE MOST NON-NUTRITIVE SWEETENERS, LICORICE HAS AN "OFF TASTE THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND LESS THAN
APPEALING.)
V W SLIPPERY ELM (ULMTIS RUBRA). THIS IS AN ALL-AROUND SOOTHER, HELPING
THE THROAT, THE RESPIRATORY TRACT AND THE DIGESTIVE TRACT. AND LIKE MOST IF NOT ALL
WOODY PLANTS, SLIPPERY ELM CONTAINS COMPOUNDS CALLED OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS,
WHICH HAVE ANTISEPTIC AND ANTI-ALLERGIC ACTION.
W BALLOONFLOWER (PLATYCODON GRANDIFIORUM). THE CHINESE HAVE GREAT
RESPECT FOR THIS PLANT'S ROOT AS A REMEDY FOR SORE THROAT AND COUGH. THERE'S EVEN A
CHINESE STAMP COMMEMORATING IT. SEVERAL JAPANESE PATENT MEDICINES FOR TREATING
BRONCHITIS EMPLOY THE ROOT EXTRACT, AND PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDIES CONFIRM ITS ANTICOUGH AND EXPECTORANT ACTIVITIES. (BALLOONFLOWER IS ALSO AN ATTRACTIVE ORNAMENTAL.
I HAVE ONE FROM CHINA THAT HAS FARED WELL IN MY GARDEN AT THE HERBAL VINEYARD.)
YOU CAN TAKE IT AS EITHER A TEA OR A TINCTURE.
405
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
W BURNET-SAXIFRAGE (PIMPINELLA MAJOR). COMMISSION E ENDORSES
BURNET-SAXIFRAGE ROOT FOR TREATING SORE THROAT AND UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS. TRY
SIMMERING THREE TO SIX TEASPOONS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES,
THEN LET IT COOL BEFORE DRINKING. FD SUGGEST ADDING A LITTLE LICORICE.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC IS A FAVORITE NATUROPATHIC REMEDY FOR
UPPER RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT'S BOTH ANTIVIRAL (FOR COLDS) AND ANTIBACTERIAL (FOR STREP THROAT). TRY IT IN TEA AS A GARGLE.
W GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). HERE'S ANOTHER HERB TO GARGLE FOR A SORE
THROAT. TRY ADDING GINGER TO LEMON JUICE, VINEGAR AND HONEY.
VV MARSH MALLOW (ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS). THIS HERB HAS BEEN USED FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR TREATING SORE THROAT AND MANY OTHER AILMENTS. IT
CONTAINS A SOOTHING WATER-SOLUBLE FIBER (MUCILAGE) THAT IS QUITE EFFECTIVE AT EASING
THROAT PAIN. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE PLANT ALSO HAS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
ACTION.
COMMISSION E APPROVES USING MARSH MALLOW ROOT TO SOOTHE IRRITATION OF THE
MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT AND TO HELP TREAT ASSOCIATED DRY
COUGH. FD SUGGEST A TEA MADE FROM THREE TEASPOONS OF CRUMBLED ROOT PER CUP OF
BOILING WATER.
VV WINTERGREEN (GAIDTHERIA PROCUMBENS). WINTERGREEN HAS A COOLING,
SOOTHING FLAVOR, AND IT CONTAINS METHYL SALICYLATE, AN HERBAL FORM OF ASPIRIN THAT
CAN HELP TREAT SORE THROAT PAIN. TRY IT AS A GARGLE FOR FAST COOLING OF INFLAMED THROAT
TISSUE AND AS A TEA FOR PAIN RELIEF. FD SUGGEST PUTTING 15 TO 25 LEAVES IN A CUP OF
BOILING WATER FOR BOTH A GARGLE AND A TEA.
DON'T GIVE EITHER ASPIRIN OR ITS NATURAL HERBAL ALTERNATIVES TO CHILDREN WITH
SORE THROATS. WHEN CHILDREN TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE DRUGS FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS (ESPECIALLY COLDS, FLU AND CHICKEN POX), THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT GET REYE'S
SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY FATAL CONDITION THAT DAMAGES THE LIVER AND BRAIN. ALSO, IF
YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.
V AGRIMONY (AGRIMONIA EUPATORIA). COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING AGRIMONY TO SOOTHE INFLAMED MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. TRY A TEA
MADE WITH TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V ANISE (PIMPINELLA ANISUM). ANISE TASTES LIKE LICORICE AND IS USED AS
THE FLAVORING AGENT IN MANY "LICORICE" ITEMS. IT'S NOT AS THROAT-SOOTHING AS REAL
LICORICE, BUT COMMISSION E SUGGESTS USING IT FOR RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY
IF YOU HAVE A PRODUCTIVE COUGH THAT PRODUCES PHLEGM. ANISE HELPS BREAK UP
BRONCHIAL CONGESTION. YOU COULD MAKE A TEA BY POURING A CUP OF BOILING WATER OVER
ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF CRUSHED ANISEED AND STEEPING FOR 10 TO 15 MINUTES. STRAIN
THE TEA BEFORE DRINKING. THE SUGGESTED DOSE IS UP TO TWO CUPS A DAY.
406
STIES
V KNOTGRASS (POLYGONUM AVICULARE). COMMISSION £
APPROVES USING A TEA MADE WITH TWO TO THREE TEASPOONS OF DRIED
HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER FOR TREATING SORE THROAT AND MILD
RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS. KNOTGRASS IS ASTRINGENT.
V MYRRH (COMMIPHORA, VARIOUS SPECIES).
HERE'S ANOTHER HERB APPROVED BY COMMISSION E AS A
TREATMENT FOR SORE THROAT. IN EUROPE THE TINCTURE IS ADDED
TO WATER AND USED AS A MOUTHWASH AND GARGLE.
V PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES).
PLANTAIN IS WIDELY USED AS AN EXTERNAL SOOTHER FOR SKIN
PROBLEMS. COMMISSION E ALSO ENDORSES IT FOR SORE THROAT
AND INFLAMMATION OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF THE
MOUTH AND THROAT. THE PLANT HAS BACTERICIDAL ACTIVITY,
MUCH OF WHICH MAY BE LOST IF IT'S HEATED, SO YOU COULD TRY
THREE TO FOUR TEASPOONS OF PLANTAIN IN JUICE OR COLD WATER.
PLANTAIN ALSO CONTAINS ALLANTOIN, A CHEMICAL THAT PROMOTES THE HEALING OF INJURED SKIN CELLS AND, I BELIEVE, THE
CELLS OF THE THROAT.
MYRRH
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS

STI ES
WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW COMMON STIES ARE, IT'S AMAZING HOW THOROUGHLY THE HERB WORLD HAS IGNORED THEM. I CHECKED MY TOP 20
HERBALS, AND NOT ONE OF THEM INDEXED STIES. SO I GUESS I'LL BE BREAKING SOME
NEW GROUND HERE. IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEBODY DID, AS THERE ARE SEVERAL GOOD HERBS
FOR STIES.
A STY IS A BACTERIAL INFECTION (TYPICALLY STAPHYLOCOCCAL) OF AN EYELASH FOLLICLE. THE INFECTION CAUSES A PUS-FILLED BUMP TO FORM ON EITHER THE INSIDE OR
OUTSIDE OF THE EYELID. THE BUMP GROWS FOR A WEEK OR SO AND THEN USUALLY SUBSIDES, POSSIBLY RUPTURING SPONTANEOUSLY AS IT HEALS.
STIES SHOULD NOT BE SQUEEZED LIKE PIMPLES, AS SQUEEZING CAN SPREAD THE
INFECTION. SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET STIES. AMONG THOSE WHO DO, THEY TEND TO RECUR.
DOCTORS OFTEN RECOMMEND HOLDING A WARM, MOIST CLOTH AGAINST THE AFFECTED
EYE TO HASTEN DRAINAGE. THEY ALSO FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS THAT ATTACK
THE BACTERIA.
407
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
GREEN PHARMACY FOR STIES
HERBALISTS ALSO HAVE TWO APPROACHES TO TREATMENT—ANTIBIOTIC HERBS PLUS
HERBS THAT BOOST THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THAT THE BODY CAN FIGHT THE INFECTION
MORE EFFECTIVELY.
V \ V ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
IMMUNE STIMULANTS. IT WAS WIDELY USED TO TREAT INFECTIONS BACK IN THE DAYS BEFORE
ANTIBIOTICS, AND NO WONDER: RESEARCH CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES ITS IMMUNOSTIMULANT
PROPERTIES.
BUT IN ADDITION, THIS HERB OF OUR GREAT PLAINS, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS
CONEFLOWER, HAS ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES. JUST SIX MILLIGRAMS OF THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS (ECHINACOSIDES) IN ECHINACEA IS THE ANTIBIOTIC EQUIVALENT OF ONE UNIT OF
PENICILLIN, ACCORDING TO HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY, PH.D., AUTHOR
OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONIC THERAPIES. (A
STANDARD DOSE OF PENICILLIN IS AROUND 180 UNITS.)
YOU TAKE THIS HERB ORALLY, EITHER IN A TEA OR IN CAPSULES, RATHER THAN USING IT
IN A COMPRESS. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO
NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
^ ^ ^ GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). LIKE ECHINACEA, GOLDENSEAL IS
BOTH AN IMMUNE BOOSTER AND AN ANTIBIOTIC. IN ONE STUDY, BERBERINE, AN ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IN THIS HERB, WAS SHOWN TO BE MORE ACTIVE AGAINST STAPH INFECTIONS, THE
KIND THAT CAUSE STIES, THAN CHLORAMPHENICOL (CHLOROMYCETIN), A POWERFUL PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIBIOTIC.
AND BERBERINE IS ONLY ONE OF THE MEDICINAL COMPOUNDS IN GOLDENSEAL AND
ITS HERB-MEDICINAL RELATIVES, BARBERRY, GOLDTHREAD, OREGON GRAPE AND YELLOWROOT. YOU CAN TAKE GOLDENSEAL ORALLY, IN EITHER TEA OR CAPSULES, BUT IT ALSO CAN BE
HELPFUL WHEN USED IN A COMPRESS.
V W POTATO (SOLARIUM TUBEROSUM). I ALWAYS LIKE TO QUOTE HERB CONSERVATIVE VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL
PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA: 'TO TREAT A
STY, TAKE FRESH SCRAPINGS FROM THE INSIDE OF A POTATO, PUT THEM ON A PIECE OF CLEAN
CLOTH AND PLACE ON THE STY. REPLACE ONCE OR TWICE WITH FRESH SCRAPINGS IT WAS
AMAZINGLY EFFECTIVE. WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THE SWELLING WAS DOWN, AND THE STY
WAS SIGNIFICANDY IMPROVED. BY THAT EVENING IT WAS ALMOST GONE."
IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR DR. TYLER, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
W V THYME (THYMUS VULGARIS). IF I HAD A STY, IN ADDITION TO TAKING ECHINACEA AND GOLDENSEAL, I THINK FD APPLY CONCENTRATED THYME TEA DIRECTLY TO THE STY
WITH A COTTON SWAB OR IN A COMPRESS.
THYME IS RICH IN THYMOL, A POTENT ANTISEPTIC, AND CONTAINS MORE THAN A
DOZEN OTHER ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
408
STROK E
^ CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA RECUTITA). CAMOMILE HAS EYELIKE FLOWERS RESEMBLING MINIATURE OXEYE DAISIES, SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT TRADITIONAL HERBALISTS
SUGGESTED EYE BATHS WITH CAMOMILE FOR STIES. ANCIENT HERBALISTS USED TO BASE MANY
OF THEIR TREATMENTS ON THE PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCE THAT PLANTS BORE TO PARTS OF THE
BODY.
BUT—SURPRISE—MODERN SCIENTIFIC HERBALISTS HAVE FOUND THAT CAMOMILE
REALLY HELPS HEAL STIES. RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D., THE DEAN OF GERMAN MEDICAL
HERBALISTS AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE, SUGGESTS USING HOT COMPRESSES MADE
WITH CAMOMILE TEA.
V GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). NATUROPATHS SEEM TO RECOMMEND GARLIC FOR
ALMOST ANY INFECTION, AND I HAVE TO AGREE, BECAUSE GARLIC IS A POTENT ANTIBIOTIC. I
SUGGEST TAKING A DOZEN CHOPPED CLOVES. EVEN IF YOU JUST CAN'T GET THIS MUCH DOWN,
USE MORE GARLIC WHEN YOU HAVE A STY.
V FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. NATUROPATHS SUGGEST EATING MORE FRUITS AND
VEGETABLES TO COMBAT INFECTIONS. THEY ARE RICH IN VITAMINS, PARTICULARLY BETACAROTENE (THE VITAMIN A PRECURSOR) AND VITAMINS C AND E. YOU MIGHT ALSO TAKE A
MULTIVITAMIN SUPPLEMENT, IF YOU DON'T ALREADY. ONE STUDY OF ELDERLY PEOPLE SHOWED
THAT A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN SIGNIFICANDY IMPROVED THEIR IMMUNE FUNCTION.
STROKE
H
ERE'S A QUOTE FROM ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF LETTERS I HAVE RECEIVED OVER
THE YEARS, WRITTEN BY PEOPLE DISILLUSIONED ENOUGH WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS TO SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE: "MY HUSBAND, AGE 57, SUFFERED A STROKE A YEAR AGO.
THE DOCTORS BELIEVE HE STILL HAS A BLOOD CLOT SOMEWHERE IN HIS BRAIN, THOUGH
THEY CAN'T SEEM TO DISSOLVE IT. HE IS CURRENTLY TAKING MANY, MANY DRUGS, BUT
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING MUCH TO HELP HIM. CAN YOU SUGGEST ANYTHING
HERBAL HE MIGHT TAKE?"
THAT'S THE USUAL LOADED QUESTION, THE ONE THAT ALWAYS PROMPTS ME TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT I'M A BOTANIST, NOT A DOCTOR. STROKES ARE VERY SERIOUS—THE
NATION'S THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH—AND ANYONE WHO HAS HAD ONE SHOULD
CERTAINLY BE UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE AND FOLLOW THEIR DOCTOR'S ADVICE.
WITH THAT SAID, HOWEVER, THERE ARE, INDEED, QUITE A FEW HERBAL APPROACHES
TO PREVENTING STROKE AND STROKE RECURRENCE, AT LEAST THE TYPE CAUSED BY BLOOD
CLOTS IN THE BRAIN (ISCHEMIC STROKES).
409
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
BRAIN "ATTACK"
APPROXIMATELY 500,000 AMERICANS HAVE STROKES ANNUALLY. EIGHTY PERCENT
OF THOSE STROKES ARE ISCHEMIC: A BLOOD CLOT LODGES IN A BRAIN ARTERY, CUTTING OFF
THE SUPPLY OF OXYGEN AND NOURISHMENT TO PART OF THAT ESSENTIAL ORGAN. WHEREVER THE BLOOD CLOT FORMS, THE AREA AROUND IT DIES OR BECOMES DAMAGED, AND THE
BODY FUNCTION CONTROLLED BY THAT AREA BECOMES IMPAIRED. WHILE SUCH A STROKE
OFTEN CAUSES DEATH, IT MIGHT LEAD INSTEAD TO SEVERE DISABILITY, SUCH AS LOSS OF
THE ABILITY TO SPEAK OR PARALYSIS OF PART OF THE BODY.
ISCHEMIC STROKES ARE OFTEN PRECEDED BY MINI-STROKES KNOWN AS TRANSIENT
ISCHEMIC ATTACKS (TIAS). TIAS LAST ANYWHERE FROM A FEW SECONDS TO SEVERAL
HOURS AND CAUSE STROKE SYMPTOMS THAT EVENTUALLY RESOLVE ON THEIR OWN. THOSE
WHO SUFFER TIAS TYPICALLY MAKE FULL OR ALMOST FULL RECOVERIES. BUT TIAS INDICATE A REAL RISK OF FUTURE CATASTROPHIC STROKE AND OFTEN SIGNAL THE START OF AGGRESSIVE PREVENTIVE TREATMENT.
THE OTHER 20 PERCENT OF STROKES ARE HEMORRHAGIC. IN THIS KIND OF STROKE, A
CEREBRAL BLOOD VESSEL BURSTS, AND THE RESULT IS THE SAME AS IN ISCHEMIC STROKE—
IMPAIRMENT OF THE PART OF THE BODY THAT THE DAMAGED AREA CONTROLS.
WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAINSTREAM OR HERBAL MEDICINE, STROKE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ARE TRICKY, BECAUSE MANY OF THE APPROACHES THAT HELP
PREVENT ISCHEMIC STROKE MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE THE RISK OF THE LESS COMMON BUT
EQUALLY DISABLING OR DEADLY HEMORRHAGIC STROKE.
TO PREVENT THE MORE COMMON ISCHEMIC STROKE, PHYSICIANS TRY TO PREVENT
ARTERIAL BLOOD CLOTS BY PRESCRIBING ANTICOAGULANT (BLOOD-THINNING) MEDICATION.
BUT WHEN THAT IS DONE, THE RISK INCREASES THAT ANY BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN WON'T
STOP, THUS INCREASING THE RISK OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE. SO STROKE PREVENTION INVOLVES A COMPLICATED BALANCING ACT.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR STROKE
BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF STROKES ARE ISCHEMIC, MOST OF THE SUGGESTIONS
IN THIS CHAPTER RELATE TO PREVENTING CEREBRAL BLOOD CLOTTING. BUT I REITERATE THAT
HEMORRHAGIC STROKES ARE ALSO A POSSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH A PERSONAL
OR FAMILY HISTORY OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE OR ANEURYSM (A DANGEROUSLY DILATED
BLOOD VESSEL).
IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH IS THE MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR STROKE,
SEE A DOCTOR AND HAVE IT TREATED. (YOU CAN ALSO ENLIST THE HELP OF THE HERBAL ALTERNATIVES SUGGESTED IN THE CHAPTER ON HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ON PAGE 254.)
PLEASE REMEMBER: IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW ANY STROKE-PREVENTIVE MEDICAL
ADVICE THAT COMES FROM YOUR DOCTOR. IN FACT, IF YOU'VE HAD A STROKE OR KNOW THAT
410
STROK E
YOU ARE AT RISK, IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO DISCUSS ANY STROKE-PREVENTING
HERBS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TRY WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
THAT SAID, HERE ARE A NUMBER OF GOOD HERBAL APPROACHES TO STROKE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF.
^ W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC IS THE BEST ANTI-CLOTTING HERB. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, IT CONTAINS MORE ANTICOAGULANT COMPOUNDS THAN ANY OTHER
HERB—NINE, TO BE EXACT. IT IS A MAJOR HERB FOR HEART ATTACK PREVENTION BECAUSE OF
ITS BLOOD-THINNING EFFECT AND ITS ABILITY TO HELP CONTROL HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THESE
SAME EFFECTS ALSO HELP PREVENT ISCHEMIC STROKE.
IF I WERE AT RISK FOR STROKE, I'D INCREASE MY USE OF GARLIC IN
COOKING AND ALSO TAKE GARLIC CAPSULES, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AT
HEALTH FOOD STORES AND MANY DRUGSTORES. GARLIC'S CLOSE RELATIVES,
ONIONS, SCALLIONS, LEEKS, CHIVES AND SHALLOTS, HAVE SIMILAR BENEFITS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF I HAD REASON TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, I'D STEER CLEAR OF
GARLIC AND ITS OTHER ANTI-CLOTTING HERBAL RELATIVES. (IF
YOU'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE WHICH CATEGORY YOU FALL
INTO, ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO HELP YOU MAKE THIS DECISION.)
W V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS
WIDELY USED IN EUROPE TO TREAT COMPLICATIONS OF
STROKE, INCLUDING MEMORY AND BALANCE PROBLEMS, VERTIGO AND DISTURBED THOUGHT PROCESSES. MANY STUDIES
SHOW THAT THIS HERB INCREASES BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN.
VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF
PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT
PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, ENDORSES THIS HERB AS A STROKE TREATMENT IN HIS EXCELLENT
BOOK, HERBS OF CHOICE.
GINKGO ALSO HELPS REDUCE FRAGILITY OF THE CAPILLARIES, THE TINY BLOOD VESSELS THAT FAN THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY, WHICH CAN HELP
PREVENT HEMORRHAGIC STROKE. IN EUROPE, MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE TAKE GINKGO REGULARLY. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS HERB DOESN'T SOON BECOME INCREASINGLY
POPULAR WITH ELDERLY FOLKS IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL.
TO TAKE THIS HERB, YOU'LL NEED TO BUY A STANDARDIZED EXTRACT. GINKGO EXTRACTS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN HEALTH FOOD STORES AND DRUGSTORES. YOU CAN TRY 60
TO 240 MILLIGRAMS A DAY, BUT DON'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THAT. IN LARGE AMOUNTS,
GINKGO MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.

*^. PIGWEED (AMARANTHUS, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING CALCIUM. A SIX-YEAR HARVARD
STUDY OF MORE THAN 40,000 HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH THOSE
WHO CONSUMED THE LEAST CALCIUM, THOSE
WHO GOT THE MOST HAD JUST ONE-THIRD THE
RISK OF SUCCUMBING TO HEART ATTACK. PERSONALLY, I BELIEVE THESE RESULTS ALSO APPLY
TO ISCHEMIC STROKES, BECAUSE THEY ARE BIOLOGICALLY SO SIMILAR TO HEART ATTACK.
PIGWEED IS AN EXCELLENT PLANT
SOURCE OF CALCIUM, WITH 5.3 PERCENT ON
A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS. ACCORDING TO MY
CALCULATIONS, ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF AN
OUNCE OF FRESH PIGWEED LEAVES WOULD
PROVIDE 500 MILLIGRAMS OF CALCIUM.
(THE DAILY VALUE IS 1,000 MILLIGRAMS.)
YOU CAN USE THE YOUNG LEAVES IN
SALADS OR STEAM THE MORE MATURE LEAVES
LIKE SPINACH. YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY PIGWEED PESTO. TO MAKE THE SAUCE, PREPARE YOUR FAVORITE PESTO RECIPE, BUT USE
PIGWEED INSTEAD OF BASIL.
PIGWEED IS NOT THE ONLY GOOD HERBAL
SOURCE OF CALCIUM. HERE ARE SOME OTHERS, IN DESCENDING ORDER OF POTENCY (ON
A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS) LAMB'S-QUARTERS, STINGING NETTLE, BROADBEANS, WATERCRESS,
LICORICE, MARJORAM, SAVORY, RED CLOVER SHOOTS, THYME, CHINESE CABBAGE (BOK
CHOY), BASIL, CELERY SEED, DANDELION AND PURSLANE.
V W WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). WILLOW BARK IS HERBAL ASPIRIN, AND
LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN—HALF OF A STANDARD TABLET TO A WHOLE TABLET A DAY—HAS BEEN
SHOWN IN SEVERAL STUDIES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ISCHEMIC STROKE BY ABOUT 18 PERCENT. (LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN ALSO CUTS HEART ATTACK RISK BY ABOUT 40 PERCENT IN MEN
AND 25 PERCENT IN WOMEN.)
YOU CAN TAKE THE LITTLE WHITE ASPIRIN PILLS, IF YOU LIKE. I PERSONALLY PREFER THE
HERBAL ROUTE: TEAS MADE FROM WILLOW BARK, MEADOWSWEET OR WINTERGREEN. I ADD A TEASPOON OR TWO OF ANY OF THESE DRIED HERBS TO EITHER HOT HERBAL TEAS OR COLD LEMONADE
AND DRINK TWO TO THREE CUPS A DAY. (I MUST CONFESS, THOUGH, THAT I TEND TO BE LAZY AND
OFTEN TAKE MY OWN LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN IN PILLS.)
THE GREEN INSURANCE PLAN
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN A SURE-FIRE METHOD
FOR PREVENTING STROKE? A REPORT PUBLISHED
IN THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS THAT STROKE RISK MIGHT BE
REDUCED 22 PERCENT SIMPLY BY EATING MORE
THAN THREE SERVINGS OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A DAY.
YOU SHOULD BE EATING AT LEAST THAT
MUCH ANYWAY, SINCE THE NATIONAL CANCER
INSTITUTE RECOMMENDS AT LEAST FIVE SERVINGS A DAY TO HELP PREVENT CANCER. AND IF
YOU FOLLOW THOSE GUIDELINES, YOU'RE
HELPING TO WARD OFF TWO MAJOR THREATS,
SINCE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES CONTAIN MANY
VITAMINS AND MINERALS THAT ARE HELPFUL IN
PREVENTING STROKE. ONE BRITISH STUDY, FOR
EXAMPLE, SUGGESTED THAT EATING THE
AMOUNT OF VITAMIN C IN JUST HALF AN ORANGE, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 100 AND 300
MILLIGRAMS, EVERY DAY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE INCIDENCE OF STROKE.
412
STROK E
AGAIN, WILLOW BARK AND THE OTHER ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS SHOULD ONLY BE USED
TO PREVENT AND TREAT ISCHEMIC STROKE. THEY ARE POWERFULLY ANTICOAGULANT AND
MAY INCREASE RISK OF HEMORRHAGE, INCLUDING HEMORRHAGIC STROKE. IN FACT, THE
PHYSICIANS HEALTH STUDY, THE LARGE SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT SHOWED ASPIRIN'S ABILITY
TO PREVENT HEART ATTACK, SHOWED A SLIGHT INCREASE IN RISK OF HEMORRHAGIC STROKE
FROM TAKING ASPIRIN DAILY. THE INCREASE WAS SMALL AND NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, BUT IF YOU*RE AT RISK FOR THIS TYPE OF STROKE, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE
TAKING ASPIRIN OR ANY ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS. (YOU PROBABLY ALSO SHOULD AVOID THEM
IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN.)
. VV CARROT (DAUCIIS CAROTA). IN A HARVARD STUDY OF 87,245 FEMALE NURSES,
CONSUMPTION OF CARROTS (AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SPINACH) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED
STROKE RISK. WOMEN WHO ATE FIVE SERVINGS OF CARROTS A WEEK SUFFERED 68 PERCENT
FEWER STROKES THAN THOSE WHO ATE CARROTS LESS THAN TWICE A MONTH.
CARROTS ARE RICH IN BETA-CAROTENE AND OTHER CAROTENOIDS, ALL MEMBERS OF
THE VITAMIN A FAMILY. OTHER STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE CAN REDUCE THEIR RISK OF
STROKE BY AS MUCH AS 54 PERCENT IF THEY EAT LOTS OF FRUITS AND VEGGIES THAT ARE
RICH IN BETA-CAROTENE AND VITAMINS C AND E.
THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR: EAT MORE CARROTS. I MUNCH THEM AS SNACKS, INCLUDE
THEM IN MY VEGETABLE SOUPS AND JUICE THEM, TOO, SOMETIMES WITH GARLIC.
W ENGLISH PEA (PISUM SATIVUM). IT TURNS OUT THAT NEARLY ALL LEGUMES CONTAIN GENISTEIN, WHICH APPEARS TO BE A CANCER-PREVENTIVE NUTRIENT. SCIENTISTS NOW
BELIEVE THAT A DIET HIGH IN GENISTEIN-RICH TOFU, A SOY PRODUCT, IS AN IMPORTANT
REASON THAT ASIAN WOMEN HAVE SUCH A LOW RATE OF BREAST CANCER.
IN ADDITION TO GUARDING AGAINST CANCER, GENISTEIN ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE A
SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CLOTTING EFFECT, MEANING THAT IT MAY ALSO HELP PREVENT ISCHEMIC
STROKE AND HEART ATTACK. I LIKE ENGLISH PEAS MORE THAN I LIKE SOYBEANS, SO THIS
RELATIVELY NEW INFORMATION WAS WELCOME NEWS TO ME. I ALSO EAT LOTS OF OTHER
BEANS AND LEGUMES. I SUGGEST THAT YOU DO, TOO.
W PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). PINEAPPLE CONTAINS A COMPOUND
KNOWN AS BROMELAIN THAT IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO BREAK DOWN PROTEINS. IT'S A
KEY INGREDIENT IN MEAT TENDERIZERS. BUT BROMELAIN ALSO HAS AN ANTI-CLOTTING ACTION
THAT MIGHT HELP PREVENT ISCHEMIC STROKE AND HEART ATTACK. THE BOTTOM LINE: EAT
MORE FRESH PINEAPPLE.
W SCURFY PEA (PSORALEA CORYLIFOLIA). THESE PEAS ALSO CONTAIN GENISTEIN.
AFTER FOUR LONG YEARS OF SEARCHING AND RESEARCHING, I FINALLY HAVE DATA TO SHOW THAT
SCURFY PEAS, CONSUMED AS A FOOD (AND REPUTED TO BE AN APHRODISIAC) IN ASIA, CONTAIN
MUCH MORE GENISTEIN THAN SOYBEANS. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE, PETER KAUFMAN, PH.D.,
1
 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN IN ANN ARBOR, FOR HELPING ME TO DETERMINE THE GENIS1
 TEIN CONTENT OF SCURFY PEAS.
413
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
V BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTULUS). BILBERRIES AND THEIR CLOSE RELATIVES,
BLUEBERRIES AND HUCKLEBERRIES, CONTAIN COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS ANTHOCYANIDINS.
GOOD EUROPEAN STUDIES SHOW THAT THESE
COMPOUNDS HELP PREVENT BLOOD CLOTS
AND ALSO BREAK DOWN PLAQUE DEPOSITS
LINING THE ARTERIES. IN ADDITION, SOME
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT BILBERRIES
HELP TO MAINTAIN CAPILLARIES.
FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, BILBERRIES AND THEIR RELATIVES MIGHT HELP
PREVENT ISCHEMIC STROKE WITHOUT INCREASING THE RISK OF HEMORRHAGIC
STROKE. MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN
HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, SAYS THAT ONE GLASS OF
HUCKLEBERRY JUICE TAKEN TWICE A WEEK
CAN HELP PREVENT STROKE. I'M NOT AS CONVINCED AS HE SEEMS TO BE, BUT THESE
BERRIES ARE DELICIOUS, AND IF THEY DO
HELP PREVENT STROKE, SO MUCH THE BETTER.
V EVENING PRIMROSE (OENOTHERA BIENNIS). THE OIL OF THIS HERB
IS RICH IN GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID (GLA),
WHICH HAS POTENT ANTI-CLOTTING AND
BLOOD PRESSURE-LOWERING ACTIONS. I
THINK IT'S PROBABLY QUITE USEFUL IN THE
PREVENTION OF STROKE AND HEART DISEASE.
BORAGE OIL IS ALSO RICH IN GLA. YOU CAN PURCHASE BOTH OF THESE OILS AT HEALTH FOOD
STORES. TO USE THEM, FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS.
^ GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). THIS IS ANOTHER HERB WITH PROVEN ANTICLOTTING ABILITY. IN ONE INDIAN STUDY, TAKING ABOUT TWO TEASPOONS OF GINGER A DAY
FOR A WEEK NEUTRALIZED THE BLOOD-CLOTTING EFFECT OF 100 GRAMS OF BUTTER. (BUT
PLEASE DON'T THINK YOU CAN CONTINUE TO EAT BUTTER IF YOU UP YOUR GINGER INTAKE.
BUTTER IS VERY HIGH IN CHOLESTEROL, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO STROKES.)
YOU MIGHT TRY USING MORE GINGER IN COOKING, OR YOU COULD BREW GINGER TEA
USING ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF FRESH GRATED ROOT PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. STEEP
UNTIL COOL.
SCURFY PEA
SCURFY PEAS HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF
A COMPOUND THAT MAY HELP PROTECT A
WOMAN'S BODY FROM HARMFUL ESTROGENS.
414
SUNBURN
V SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING FOLATE.
A GOOD DEAL OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES CAN HELP PREVENT
STROKE. STUDIES AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN
BIRMINGHAM, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT FOLATE CAN HELP PREVENT BOTH
HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. COMPARED WITH PEOPLE WHO CONSUMED LITTLE FOLATE, THOSE
WHO INGESTED THE MOST WERE ONLY HALF AS LIKELY TO SHOW NARROWING OF THE CAROTID
ARTERY, THE ARTERY THAT LEADS TO THE BRAIN.
FOLATE IS NOT PLENTIFUL IN PLANTS, BUT ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, SPINACH,
CABBAGE, ENDIVE, ASPARAGUS, PARSLEY, OKRA AND PIGWEED ALL HAVE THIS IMPORTANT
NUTRIENT, SO THE MORE OF THESE VEGGIES YOU GET IN YOUR DIET, THE BETTER.
V TURMERIC (CUCURMA LONGA). MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT THE COMPOUND CURCUMIN, WHICH IS FOUND IN THIS HERB, HELPS PREVENT THE FORMATION OF BLOOD CLOTS.
TURMERIC IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN MOST CURRY SPICE BLENDS. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER EATING MORE CURRY DISHES OR EVEN MAKING YOUR OWN TURMERIC CAPSULES.
MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES SELL EMPTY GELATIN CAPSULES.
SUNWN
F
ROM GRADE SCHOOL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, I LOUNGED AROUND BY THE SWIMMING POOL ALL SUMMER, SOAKING UP THE SUN. IN COLLEGE, I PLAYED THE
BASS FIDDLE AND GUITAR AT SEVERAL BEACHES DURING THE SUMMERS. THAT MEANT
MORE DAYS LYING AROUND IN THE SUN AT PRIME SPOTS SUCH AS GRAND HAVEN,
MICHIGAN, AND ATLANTIC BEACH, OCEAN DRIVE AND MYRTLE BEACH IN THE CAROLINAS.
ALL THAT SUN EXPOSURE PLACED ME AT CONSIDERABLE RISK FOR SKIN CANCER,
AND I'VE LIVED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. I HAVE ALREADY HAD A PATCH OF CANCER REMOVED, AND OTHER BLEMISHES HAVE APPEARED THAT WILL SOON NEED ATTENTION.
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON. NOW, WHENEVER I'M ON A BOAT IN THE TROPICS, I USE
SUNSCREEN AND WEAR LONG-SLEEVED SHIRTS, AND SOMETIMES EVEN LIGHTWEIGHT
GLOVES AND A BROAD-BRIMMED HAT. ALL THIS SUN PROTECTION GOES AGAINST MY UPBRINGING, BUT GIVEN THE PLACES I TRAVEL, IT'S ESSENTIAL. AND ALTHOUGH I DO WHAT I
CAN TO KEEP THE SUN OFF, IN AMAZONIA I SEEM TO GET SUNBURNED EVEN WHEN I'M
ALL COVERED.
415
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SUNBURN
AS BURNS GO, MOST SUNBURNS ARE COMPARATIVELY MILD. BUT SUNBURNS COVER A LOT MORE OF THE BODY THAN MOST OTHER EVERYDAY BURNS. AND IN ADDITION TO INCREASING
CANCER RISK, THEY CAN BE QUITE PAINFUL. FORTUNATELY, NATURE HAS PROVIDED US WITH
SEVERAL GOOD REMEDIES.
W * TEA {CAMELLIA SINENSIS). THE CHINESE RECOMMEND APPLYING COOLED
BLACK TEA TO THE SKIN TO SOOTHE SUNBURN. THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME BECAUSE OF SEVERAL BENEFICIAL CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT TEA CONTAINS.
ONE RESEARCHER I KNOW SAYS THAT THE TANNIC ACID AND THEOBROMINE IN TEA
HELP REMOVE HEAT FROM SUNBURN. OTHER COMPOUNDS IN TEA CALLED CATECHINS HELP
PREVENT AND REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE AND MAY EVEN HELP PREVENT CHEMICAL- AND RADIATION-INDUCED SKIN CANCERS. THE LATEST STUDIES SHOW THAT GREEN TEA IS ALSO
HIGH IN CHEMICALS CALLED POLYPHENOLS. WHEN INGESTED, THESE CHEMICALS HELP
PROTECT THE SKIN AGAINST DAMAGE FROM THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION THAT CAUSES SUNBURN.
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT'S BETTER TO AVOID SUNBURN THAN ENDURE THE AFTEREFFECTS. BUT IF YOU DO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN THE SUN WITH NOT ENOUGH SUNSCREEN, SOOTHE THE BURN BY SIPPING ICED GREEN TEA. THEN APPLY COOL COMPRESSES
OF THE TEA TO ANY AREAS OF SKIN THAT HAVE BEEN OVEREXPOSED.
VV ALOE (ALOE VERA). THE INNER GEL OF THE ALOE VERA LEAF HAS BEEN SHOWN TO
SPEED THE HEALING OF RADIATION-INDUCED BUMS. YOU CAN SCOOP THE GEL DIRECDY FROMSPLIT LEAVES OR BUY COMMERCIALLY PREPARED GEL AT A HEALTH FOOD STORE OR HERB SHOP.
APPLY ALOE GEL AFTER SHOWERING, THEN REAPPLY IT A FEW MORE TIMES EACH DAY
UNTIL THE PAIN HAS SUBSIDED, SUGGESTS CARDIAC SURGEON AND SPORTS MEDICINE SPECIALIST ROBERT D. WILLIX, M.D., OF BOCA RATON, FLORIDA. USUALLY, HE SAYS, THE
REDNESS DISAPPEARS IN A DAY OR TWO, AND THE SKIN DOES NOT PEEL.
W BLACK NIGHTSHADE (SOLANUM NIGRUM). SOME INDIANA FOLK HERBALISTS
CRUSH NIGHTSHADE LEAVES, STIR THEM INTO HEAVY CREAM AND PAT THE MIXTURE ON SUNBUM, NOTES VARRO TYLER, PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY
(NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA.
I'VE WITNESSED A SIMILAR PRACTICE IN THE AMAZON. A PERUVIAN SHAMANISTIC
HEALER I KNOW USES AN AMAZONIAN SPECIES OF NIGHTSHADE TO TREAT ALL MANNER OF
BUMS, NOT JUST SUNBURN. HE CHOPS THE LEAVES TO EXPRESS A GREENISH JUICE, WHICH
HE APPLIES TO A BUM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SWEARING THAT IT PREVENTS SCARRING.
IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A BLACK NIGHTSHADE PLANT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THIS
ONE A TRY. COMPOUNDS IN OTHER SPECIES OF SOLANUM HAVE PROVED USEFUL IN HELPING
TO PREVENT SKIN CANCER.
416
SUNBURN
W CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CALENDULA
FLOWERS SPEED THE HEALING OF BURNS BY CLOSING WOUNDS, REDUCING INFLAMMATION
AND STIMULATING THE GROWTH OF NEW SKIN CELLS. YOU CAN BUY COMMERCIAL SKIN
CREAMS CONTAINING CALENDULA AT MANY HEALTH FOOD STORES.
VV CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS). THE COOL CUCUMBER IS OFTEN USED FOR
SOOTHING BURNS, NOTES PHARMACOGNOSIST ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. SIMPLY SLICE OPEN
A CUCUMBER AND WIPE IT DIRECDY ON YOUR SKIN.
W EGGPLANT (SOLANUM MELONGENA). LIKE BLACK NIGHTSHADE AND ITS AMAZONIAN COUSIN, WHICH ARE ALSO IN THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILY, EGGPLANT HAS A FOLK REPUTATION AS A SUNBURN TREATMENT. IT ACTUALLY CONTAINS COMPOUNDS USED IN SUNNY
AUSTRALIA FOR THE TREATMENT OF SKIN CANCERS.
OF COURSE, YOU'RE BETTER OFF USING SUNSCREEN TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE SUN.
BUT IF YOU DO GET A SUNBURN, THERE'S PROBABLY NO REASON WHY YOU SHOULDN'T TRY APPLYING SOME MASHED EGGPLANT TO YOUR SKIN TO SEE IF IT WILL HELP SOOTHE THE BURN.
W PLANTAIN (PLANTAGO, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE LATE ALABAMA FOLK
HERBALIST TOMMIE BASS USED PLANTAIN FOR SUNBURN, STINGS, POISON IVY AND POISON
OAK. AND HE WAS RIGHT, SINCE PLANTAIN CONTAINS ALLANTOIN, A PROVEN HEALER OF INJURED SKIN CELLS.
W WITCH HAZEL (HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA). IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS
COMPARED THREE SUNBURN TREATMENTS: WITCH HAZEL, 1 PERCENT HYDROCORTISONE,
AND CAMOMILE CREAM. THE HYDROCORTISONE BEAT THE WITCH HAZEL, WHICH IN TURN
BEAT THE CAMOMILE. STILL, THE WITCH HAZEL WORKED PRETTY WELL, AND IT'S FREE WHERE
I COME FROM.
YOU CAN BUY A COMMERCIAL SOLUTION AND APPLY IT STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE IN
A COMPRESS. OR TRY ONE TEASPOON OF WITCH HAZEL COMBINED WITH ONE TEASPOON OF
HONEY AND A BEATEN EGG WHITE. YOU CAN ALSO MIX ONE TABLESPOON EACH OF WITCH
HAZEL, OLIVE OIL AND GLYCERIN AND GIVE THAT A TRY.
V VITAMINS AND MINERALS. IN MY DATABASE, VITAMIN E (TOCOPHEROL) IS THE
NUTRIENT MOST CITED FOR ANTI-SUNBURN ACTIVITY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY A CREAM CONTAINING VITAMIN E TO SOOTHE SUNBURNED SKIN.
IN ADDITION, ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT 1-SELENOMETHIONINE, A NATURAL AMINO
ACID, REDUCES THE SKIN DAMAGE CAUSED BY SUNBURN. THE STUDY WAS DONE BY
KAREN E. BURKE, M.D., OF CABRINI MEDICAL CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY. SELENOMETHIONINE IS EFFECTIVE BOTH APPLIED TO THE SKIN AND TAKEN ORALLY. DR. BURKE
RECOMMENDS TAKING 100 MICROGRAMS A DAY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, AND SHE
SUGGESTS 200 MICROGRAMS A DAY FOR ANYONE WITH A FAMILY HISTORY OF ANY KIND OF
CANCER. (BRAZIL NUTS ARE PARTICULARLY RICH IN THIS NUTRIENT.)
417
SWELLING
A
N EDITOR CALLED ME WITH A PLEA FOR HELP. SHE SOUNDED LIKE AN UPWARDLY
MOBILE YOUNG WOMAN WORKING FOR ONE OF THOSE UPWARDLY MOBILE
WOMEN'S HEALTH MAGAZINES. BUT SHE WAS STUMPED AND IN A HURRY. WITH A DEADLINE LOOMING, HER BOSS HAD CHALLENGED A STATEMENT THAT CUCUMBER IS GOOD FOR
SWOLLEN AREAS, ESPECIALLY SWOLLEN EYELIDS. SHE WANTED ME TO FIND OUT IF IT WAS
REALLY TRUE—IN AN HOUR. WHERE'S THE PROOF? HER BOSS WANTED TO KNOW.
SWELLING IS AN ENLARGEMENT OF A LOCALIZED AREA CAUSED BY ABNORMAL FLUID
ACCUMULATION BETWEEN CELLS. IT IS USUALLY THE RESULT OF INFECTION, INJURY OR RETENTION OR SHIFTING OF BODY FLUIDS. IN MEDICAL JARGON, THE WORD FOR SWELLING IS
EDEMA, WHICH IS THE GREEK WORD FOR IT. AND ANY MEDICINE OR POULTICE THAT REDUCES SWELLING IS CALLED AN ANTI-EDEMIC.
NOW I KNEW THAT CUCUMBER HAD ENJOYED A LONG FOLK REPUTATION AS AN ANTIEDEMIC, BUT THAT INFORMATION WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS EDITOR. SHE NEEDED
SCIENTIFIC PROOF. SO I LABORIOUSLY PLOWED THROUGH MY DATABASE AND DISCOVERED
THAT YES, INDEED, CUCUMBER CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO ANTI-EDEMIC COMPOUNDS:
ASCORBIC ACID AND CAFFEIC ACID. IT ALSO CONTAINS A CHEMICAL RELATIVE OF VITAMIN
A, WHICH MAY HELP AS WELL.
OF COURSE, ONCE I GOT GOING, I BECAME FASCINATED BY ALL THE ANTI-EDEMICS I
TURNED UP, AND I OFFERED HER THE LIST—NOTABLY GINGER, PINEAPPLE AND TURMERIC.
BUT ALL SHE WANTED WAS VERIFICATION OF CUCUMBER, WHICH I GAVE HER, ALTHOUGH AS
ANTI-EDEMICS GO, IT'S ON THE WEAK SIDE.
STILL, AS A RESULT OF THAT DATABASE SEARCH, I CAN NOW OFFER THIS TIP: IF YOU EVER
DEVELOP SWOLLEN EYELIDS, CUT TWO CIRCULAR SECTIONS OF COOL CUCUMBER, LIE DOWN
AND PLACE THE SLICES ON YOUR CLOSED EYELIDS. IT JUST MIGHT HELP.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR SWELLING
BESIDES CUCUMBER SLICES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HERBS THAT CAN ALSO
HELP REDUCE SWELLING.
VVV GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). FOR CENTURIES, INDIA'S TRADITIONAL
AYURVEDIC PHYSICIANS HAVE RECOMMENDED GINGER, ESPECIALLY FOR SWELLING CAUSED
BY ARTHRITIS. MORE RECENTLY, SEVERAL RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT ENZYMES THAT
HELP DIGEST PROTEIN, KNOWN AS PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES, ALSO HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
ACTION.
ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT, THE COMPOUND ZINGIBAIN, WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST
ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN GINGER, IS ALSO ONE OF NATURE'S MOST POTENT PROTEOLYTIC EN418
SWELLIN G
ZYMES. JUST ONE GRAM OF ZINGIBAIN CAN TENDERIZE AS MUCH AS 20 POUNDS OF MEAT.
A DANISH RESEARCHER REPORTED ONE CASE OF A WOMAN WITH RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS WHO FOUND NO RELIEF FROM TAKING CORTICOSTEROIDS, WHICH ARE COMMONLY
PRESCRIBED TO TREAT THE PAIN AND SWELLING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION. SHE
BEGAN TAKING 50 GRAMS OF GINGER A DAY (THAT'S ALMOST TWO OUNCES, OR 25 TEASPOONS) AND WITHIN 30 DAYS REPORTED CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION OF SWELLING, AS WELL
AS SOME PAIN RELIEF. "GINGER,** THE RESEARCHER WROTE, "PRODUCED BETTER RELIEF OF
SWELLING, PAIN AND STIFFNESS THAN NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS."
OF COURSE, 50 GRAMS OF GINGER A DAY IS A TALL ORDER (AND YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
NOT TAKE THIS MUCH IF YOU ARE PREGNANT). BUT GIVEN GINGER*S TRADITIONAL USE FOR
TREATING ARTHRITIC SWELLING AND THE HERB'S PROTEOLYTIC ACTION, I'M INCLINED TO BELIEVE THIS REPORT.
I HAVE, ON OCCASION, ENJOYED 50 GRAMS OF CANDIED GINGER. IT'S A HOT, SPICY
CANDY THAT'S AVAILABLE IN MANY SHOPS THAT SELL GOURMET ITEMS. IT WOULD BE A FAIRLY
EASY WAY TO GET THIS MUCH GINGER IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THIS TREATMENT A TRY, BUT
GINGER IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN CAPSULES.
W PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). THIS FRUIT CONTAINS THE PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME BROMELAIN. NATUROPATH MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., CO-AUTHOR OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF NATURAL MEDICINE AND SEVERAL OTHER SCHOLARLY BOOKS ON NUTRITIONAL AND
NATUROPATHIC HEALING, RECOMMENDS TAKING THE PURE COMPOUND, WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN HEALTH FOOD STORES, TO REDUCE SWELLING, PARTICULARLY THE KIND CAUSED BY
SURGICAL INCISIONS AND TRAUMATIC INJURIES. BROMELAIN BLOCKS THE PRODUCTION OF
KININS, THE COMPOUNDS PRODUCED DURING INFLAMMATION THAT INCREASE SWELLING
AND INDUCE PAIN.
DR. MURRAY'S SUGGESTED DOSE IS 400 TO 500 MILLIGRAMS TAKEN THREE TIMES A
DAY ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. PERSONALLY, I LOVE PINEAPPLE, AND MY OWN RECOMMENDATION IS TO SIMPLY EAT MORE OF THIS DELICIOUS FRUIT.
VV TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). INDIA'S TRADITIONAL AYURVEDIC PHYSICIANS
APPLY TWO PARTS TURMERIC AND ONE PART SALT TO SWOLLEN AREAS. SOME ALSO INCLUDE
GINGER IN THIS MIXTURE. SCIENCE CONFIRMS THIS ANCIENT WISDOM. WHEN RESEARCHERS
GAVE TURMERIC OIL TO EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, THEY FOUND THAT IT HAD ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-EDEMIC AND ANTI-ARTHRITIC ACTIVITY.
DR. MURRAY HAILS CURCUMIN, THE MOST ACTIVE CONSTITUENT IN TURMERIC, AS ONE
OF NATURE'S MOST POTENT ANTI-EDEMIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS. HE RECOMMENDS TAKING 400 MILLIGRAMS OF THE PURE COMPOUND CURCUMIN THREE TIMES A DAY.
AGAIN, I PREFER THE WHOLE-HERB APPROACH. I SUGGEST SIMPLY EATING MORE CURRIES,
HEAVY ON THE TURMERIC.
V ALOE (ALOE VERA). PEOPLE IN THE WEST INDIES APPLY THE GEL OF ALOE TO
TREAT THE SWELLING THAT COMES FROM WATER RETENTION. BAHAMIANS EVEN DRINK ALOE
419
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
JUICE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WEST INDIANS ALSO HEAT THE SPLIT LEAVES AND APPLY THE
WARM INTERIOR OF THE LEAF TO BRUISES AND SWOLLEN AREAS.
ALOE CONTAINS AN ENZYME (BRADYKININASE) THAT HELPS DECREASE SWELLING AND
RELIEVE PAIN. IT ALSO CONTAINS MAGNESIUM LACTATE, WHICH IS AN ANTIHISTAMINE, SO
THE HERB MAY ALSO HELP RELIEVE THE ITCHING ASSOCIATED WITH SOME SWELLING.
V ARNICA (ARNICA MONTANA). ARNICA, ALSO KNOWN AS MOUNTAIN DAISY, IS
A FAVORITE AMONG HOMEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS FOR TREATING THE SWELLING CAUSED BY
SPORTS INJURIES.
XV^ ) N.\ ^N
 L A RS
E R
 DOSES—MORE THAN HOMEOPATHIC DOCTORS
WOULD RECOMMEND—THIS HERB GETS A THUMBS-UP
FROM COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S
GROUP OF HERBAL MEDICINE EXPERTS. THIS GROUP
ENDORSES EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS OF ARNICA FLOWERS
AS A QUICK FIX FOR WATER RETENTION, BRUISES,
DISLOCATIONS, SPRAINS AND RHEUMATIC MUSCLE
AND JOINT COMPLAINTS. THE COMMISSION SUGGESTS USING TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER
CUP OF BOILING WATER TO MAKE A TEA TO USE AS A
WASH. YOU CAN ALSO DILUTE A TINCTURE (ONE
PART TINCTURE AND THREE TO TEN PARTS WATER) TO
USE IN A COMPRESS.
V CAT'S CLAW (UNCARIA, VARIOUS
SPECIES)* ALSO KNOWN AS UNA DE GOTO, CAT'S
CLAW IS AN AMAZONIAN HERB THAT'S BECOMING
QUITE POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WITH
GOOD REASON. TWO RESEARCHERS SENT ME A REPORT
IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS SEVERAL COMPOUNDS
(QUINOVIC ACID GLYCOSIDES) THAT SHOW SYSTEMIC
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY. THEY SUGGESTED
THAT CAT'S CLAW EXTRACT WAS BETTER AT RELIEVING SWELLING THAN INDOMETHACIN (INDOCIN), A STANDARD NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG THAT IS OFTEN PRESCRIBED
FOR THAT PURPOSE.
MY OWN EXPERIMENTS WITH CAT'S CLAW HAVEN'T BEEN THAT POSITIVE, BUT YOU
CAN TRY IT AND SEE IF IT WORKS FOR YOU.
V CORN (ZEA MAYS). THE CHINESE HAVE USED CORNSILK SUCCESSFULLY TO TREAT
SWELLING CAUSED BY KIDNEY DISEASE, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT
PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. IN ONE SMALL THREE-MONTH STUDY OF 12 PEOPLE
WITH KIDNEY DISEASE, WATER RETENTION DISAPPEARED IN 9 PEOPLE AND MOSTLY DISAP-
*---^A*Y
COT'S CLAW
A NEWCOMER FROM THE AMAZON,
CAT S CLAW CONTAINS SUBSTANCES
THAT CAN HELP RELIEVE SWELLING
AND INFLAMMATION.
420
TINNITUS
PEARED IN 2 OTHERS. THE PEOPLE WERE GIVEN ABOUT TWO OUNCES OF DRY CORNSILK TWICE
A DAY. CORNSILK IS AN EFFECTIVE DIURETIC AND IS THUS USEFUL FOR GETTING RID OF EXCESS
WATER.
V DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). ALSO A POTENT DIURETIC, DANDELION CAN REMOVE SOME OF THE EXCESS FLUID THAT CAUSES SWELLING. YOU CAN EAT THE
FRESH ROOTS, FLOWERS AND LEAVES OR USE THEM TO MAKE TEA. YOU CAN ALSO BUY CAPSULES.
V MULTIFLORA ROSE (ROSA MULTIFLORA). NOW A SERIOUS WEED IN THE EASTERN
PART OF THE UNITED STATES, MULTIFLORA ROSE IS LISTED IN CHINESE PHARMACY REFERENCE
BOOKS AS A GOOD TREATMENT FOR SWELLING. YOU CAN TRY A TEA MADE WITH TWO TO THREE
TEASPOONS OF DRIED HERB PER CUP OF BOILING WATER.
V SPANISH NEEDLES (BHDENS PILOSA). THIS IS A PLANT THAT BELONGS TO THE
SAME BOTANICAL FAMILY AS FEVERFEW. IT IS A POPULAR FOLK MEDICINE IN TAIWAN FOR ALL
SORTS OF ILLNESSES, FROM INFLUENZA TO HEPATITIS. IN ONE STUDY WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS,
TAIWANESE SCIENTISTS SHOWED THAT THIS HERB HAS SIGNIFICANT ANTI-EDEMIC AND ANTIINFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED HERE, BUT FM INTRIGUED, AND FM
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FURTHER REPORTS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
TINIIITUS
MY SISTER-IN-LAW, BARB, WHO LIVES IN HAWAII, HAS TINNITUS, OR RINGING IN
THE EARS. SHE ASKED ME IF THERE ARE ANY HERBS THAT CAN BE USED TO
TREAT IT. YES, INDEED, I REPLIED—GINKGO. SHE TRIED THIS MARVELOUS HERB, AND THE
RINGING WENT AWAY.
BUT BARB NO LONGER TAKES GINKGO. WHEN I LAST SPOKE WITH HER, SHE WAS BACK
ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO TREAT THIS CONDITION. WHY? IT SEEMS THAT BARB GETS HER
SYNTHETIC DRUGS FREE FROM HER HMO AND MEDICARE, BUT SHE CAN'T GET GINKGO
FREE. AND GINKGO TENDS TO BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE.
OF COURSE, BARB'S DRUGS ARE NOT REALLY FREE. SHE PAYS FOR THEM THROUGH HER
HMO MEMBERSHIP AND HER TAXES THAT SUPPORT MEDICARE.
BARB'S DRUG WAS APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)
WITHOUT HAVING BEEN TESTED AGAINST GINKGO. THE FDA REALLY SHOULD HAVE TESTED
GINKGO, TOO. IT'S CHEAPER THAN THE DRUG—IF YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DRUG OUT OF
YOUR OWN POCKET, THAT IS. IT'S ALSO MORE NATURAL, AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE AND PERHAPS SAFER.
421
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
GREEN PHARMACY FOR TINNITUS
TINNITUS IS CHRONIC RINGING IN THE EARS, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THE SOUND IS
MORE LIKE A ROARING OR WHOOSHING. DOCTORS DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT CAUSES TINNITUS AND OFTEN HAVE VERY LITTLE SUCCESS IN ALLEVIATING IT. FORTUNATELY, NATURAL
APPROACHES CAN HELP.
W V GINKGO {GINKGO BILOBA). HUNDREDS OF EUROPEAN STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USE OF STANDARDIZED GINKGO EXTRACT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING, INCLUDING TINNITUS, VERTIGO, MEMORY LOSS AND POOR CIRCULATION.
GINKGO DOES NOT WORK IN EVERY CASE OF TINNITUS, BUT IT IS THE HERB FD TRY FIRST.
THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN GINKGO LEAF, GINKGOLIDES, OCCUR IN CONCENTRATIONS TOO DILUTE TO ALLOW THE USE OF TEAS OR TINCTURES. THE WAY TO TAKE GINKGO IS
AS A 50:1 STANDARDIZED EXTRACT, MEANING THAT 50 POUNDS OF GINKGO LEAVES ARE
PROCESSED INTO 1 POUND OF EXTRACT. YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY THIS EXTRACT IN A PHARMACY
OR HEALTH FOOD STORE; LOOK FOR 50:1 ON THE LABEL. MOST EXPERTS RECOMMEND TAKING
40 MILLIGRAMS OF GINKGO EXTRACT THREE TIMES A DAY TO TREAT TINNITUS.
W SESAME (SESAMUM INDICIIM). CHINESE HERBALISTS RECOMMEND SESAME
SEEDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TINNITUS, BLURRED VISION AND DIZZINESS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO
GIVE SESAME SEEDS A TRY, THERE'S PROBABLY NO HARM IN ADDING IT TO FOODS. OR TRY
TAHINI, THE PEANUT-BUTTER-LIKE SPREAD MADE FROM SESAME SEEDS, OR HALVAH, WHICH IS
SESAME CANDY.
V BLACK COHOSH (CIMICIFITGA RACEMOSA). IN HER INTERESTING FEMINIST
HERBAL, THE ROOTS OF HEALING, DEB SOULE, DISTINGUISHED MAINE HERBALIST AND
FOUNDER OF AVENA BOTANICALS, SPINS THE TALE OF A PROFESSIONAL FLUTIST NEIGHBOR OF
HERS WHO HAD BEEN TROUBLED FOR YEARS BY TINNITUS. THIS NEIGHBOR TOOK BLACK COHOSH TINCTURE FOR A FEW WEEKS, AND HIS TINNITUS ALMOST DISAPPEARED. HE BECAME
A DISCIPLE OF HERBALISM. DEB ADDS THAT BLACK COHOSH AND GINKGO ARE A GOOD
COMBINATION.
V GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE HERBAL HANDBOOK AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE PRACTITIONERS,
SUGGESTS THAT GOLDENSEAL MAY HELP SOME CASES OF TINNITUS. IT SEEMS AS IF IT
MIGHT BE WORTH A TRY.
V LESSER PERIWINKLE (VINCA MINOR). THIS EVERGREEN GROUNDCOVER ADORNS
SOME OF MY SUNNY AND SANDY SLOPES, BUT FD NEVER HEARD OF USING IT MEDICINALLY
UNTIL I CHECKED A REFERENCE FROM RUDOLPH FRITZ WEISS, M.D., GERMANY'S LEADING
HERBAL DOCTOR AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE. DR. WEISS REPORTS THAT LESSER PERIWINKLE CONTAINS VINCAMINE, A CHEMICAL COMPOUND THAT REPORTEDLY GIVES GOOD RESULTS WITH TINNITUS AND MENIERE'S SYNDROME. HE SUGGESTS TAKING 20 MILLIGRAMS OF
DRIED HERB THREE TIMES A DAY. SINCE THERE ARE SOME SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS HERB,
HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW A PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT.
422
TONSILLITI S
V SPINACH (SPINACIA OLERACEA) AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING ZINC.
NOTING THAT ZINC DEFICIENCY SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH TINNITUS AND CERTAIN KINDS
OF HEARING LOSS (SENSORINEURAL), MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR
OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND
AUTHOR OF THE NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS, SUGGESTS TAKING 60 TO 120 MILLIGRAMS OF ZINC A DAY. THIS IS A LOT OF ZINC (THE DAILY VALUE IS 15 MILLIGRAMS), SO
YOU SHOULD NOT TRY THIS THERAPY WITHOUT DISCUSSING IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO SIMPLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ZINC YOU GET
FROM FOOD. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, GOOD SOURCES OF ZINC INCLUDE SPINACH (THE
BEST), PARSLEY, COLLARDS, BRUSSELS SPROUTS, CUCUMBERS, STRING BEANS, ENDIVE,
COWPEAS, PRUNES AND ASPARAGUS.I DOUBT THAT ANYONE COULD GET 60 MILLIGRAMS
OF ZINC A DAY FROM DIET ALONE, BUT YOU COULD CERTAINLY MAKE A POINT OF TAKING
IN MORE ZINC FROM YOUR FOOD WHILE TRYING OTHER HERBAL TREATMENTS FOR TINNITUS. I
CAN ALSO RECOMMEND WHIPPING UP A TASTY ZINCOPHILE SOUP. TOSS ANY OR ALL OF
THE VEGETABLES LISTED (EXCEPT THE PRUNES) INTO A GOOD VEGETABLE SOUP.
HERBS TO AVOID. IF TINNITUS BOTHERS YOU, DON'T TAKE ASPIRIN OR ASPIRIN-LIKE
HERBS—WILLOW BARK, MEADOWSWEET AND WINTERGREEN. HIGH DOSES OF ASPIRIN MAY
CAUSE RINGING IN THE EARS. I'VE ALSO SEEN REPORTS THAT A FEW OTHER HERBS MAY AGGRAVATE TINNITUS, AMONG THEM CINCHONA, BLACK HAW AND UVA URSI.
TONSILLITIS
A
LTHOUGH I FREQUENDY HAD TROUBLE WITH MY TONSILS WHEN I WAS A KID, MY
MOTHER NEVER HAD THEM TAKEN OUT, IN SPITE OF PRESSURE FROM THE M.D.'S
SHE CONSULTED. BUT WHEN MY YOUNGER BROTHER CAME ALONG, SHE FOLLOWED THE DOCTORS' ADVICE.
BROTHER DAN'S TONSILS CAME OUT. HE THEN FACED A CONSTANT ROUND OF ALLERGIES AND INFECTIONS. WERE THESE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HIS GENES? I DOUBT IT.
COULD IT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO WITH HIS TONSILLECTOMY? I'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE,
BUT I SUSPECT THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEEN A FACTOR. DOCTORS NOW KNOW THAT TONSILS DO
HELP FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS. AND MEDICAL OPINION NOW HOLDS THAT FAR TOO MANY TONSILS WERE REMOVED BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN MY BROTHER HAD HIS TAKEN OUT.
I STILL GET INFECTIONS IN MY TONSILS. WOULD I BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THEM? I
CAN'T SAY FOR SURE, BUT I DO THANK MY MOM FOR LEAVING THEM WHERE THEY BELONG.
TONSILLITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE TONSILS, THE SMALL ROUND LYMPH GLANDS
423
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SITTING ON THE SIDES OF THE THROAT. IT OCCURS MOST FREQUENTLY IN CHILDREN UNDER
NINE. USUALLY THE TONSILS BECOME INFLAMED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO
INFECTION-CAUSING MICROORGANISMS, FREQUENTLY STREPTOCOCCAL BACTERIA OR A VIRUS.
IF YOU HAVE TONSILLITIS, YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR FOR TREATMENT. IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO TREAT A STREP INFECTION WITH ANTIBIOTICS BECAUSE THIS KIND OF INFECTION
CAN LEAD TO A HEART-DAMAGING BOUT OF RHEUMATIC FEVER.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR TONSILLITIS
TONSILLITIS—AND INFLAMMATION OF THE RELATED GLANDS, THE ADENOIDS—SHOWS
THAT THE BODY IS DEFENDING ITSELF FROM INFECTION. HERE ARE THE HERBS THAT CAN
HELP FIGHT OFF THE INFECTION AND SOOTHE THE INFLAMMATION.
V"%^ ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). HERBS THAT ENHANCE IMMUNITY ARE USEFUL IN ALMOST ALL INFECTIONS. ECHINACEA, ALSO KNOWN AS CONEFLOWER, IS
A FINE ONE, ACCORDING TO MANY EUROPEAN STUDIES. ECHINACEA STIMULATES PHAGOCYTOSIS, THE DEVOURING OF BACTERIA AND VIRUSES BY CERTAIN TYPES OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS.
AS WITH SO MANY MOUTH AND THROAT INFECTIONS, I'D RECOMMEND GOING WITH A DOUBLE
WHAMMY BY TAKING ECHINACEA ALONG WITH GOLDENSEAL, ANOTHER POTENT ANTISEPTIC,
ANTIBIOTIC AND IMMUNE STIMULANT.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC IS USEFUL IN TREATING ANY KIND OF THROAT
INFECTION, INCLUDING TONSILLITIS. JAMES BALCH, M.D., A UROLOGIST, AND HIS WIFE,
PHYLLIS, A CERTIFIED NUTRITIONAL CONSULTANT, RECOMMEND TAKING TWO GARLIC CAPSULES A
DAY FOR EITHER SORE THROAT OR TONSILLITIS. (THEY ALSO SUGGEST EATING MORE OF GARLIC'S
CLOSE RELATIVE, ONIONS.)
CAPSULES ARE A CONVENIENT WAY TO TAKE GARLIC, BUT NOT ALL EXPERTS GIVE THEM
TOP BILLING. JANE GUILTINAN, N.D., CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN
SEATTLE, FOR EXAMPLE, PREFERS WHOLE GARLIC CLOVES TO CAPSULES OR EXTRACTS. I
AGREE.
MAY I SUGGEST THAT MY TONSIL SOUP IS ALSO GOOD FOR TREATING TONSILLITIS? TO
MAKE IT, USE ANY FAVORITE RECIPE FOR AN ONION/GARLIC SOUP. THEN BE VERY GENEROUS WITH ANY OR ALL OF THE HOT SPICES THAT CONTAIN VITAMIN C AND OTHER GOOD
SORE-THROAT FIGHTERS, INCLUDING CHILI PEPPER, GINGER, HORSERADISH, MUSTARD SEED
AND PEPPER.
VV HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA JAPONICA). HONEYSUCKLE FLOWERS ARE USED IN
CHINA TO TREAT TONSILLITIS, BRONCHITIS, COLDS, FLU AND PNEUMONIA. EXTRACTS MADE FROM
THESE FLOWERS ACT STRONGLY AGAINST A BROAD SPECTRUM OF BACTERIA. IT'S SMALL WONDER,
SINCE THE FLOWERS CONTAIN MORE THAN A DOZEN ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS.
IN ONE STUDY, RESEARCHERS LOOKED AT 425 CHINESE STUDENTS WITH STREP THROAT.
THIS IS NOT TONSILLITIS, ADMITTEDLY, BUT IT IS A RELATED THROAT INFECTION. IN THIS
STUDY, RESEARCHERS SPURRED RAPID HEALING BY INTRODUCING AN HERBAL PREPARATION
424
TONSILLITI S
THAT INCLUDED POWDERED DRIED HONEYSUCKLE FLOWERS INTO THE BACKS OF THE STUDENTS' THROATS.
I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE HONEYSUCKLE, BY ITSELF OR COMBINED WITH FORSYTHIA, TO TREAT TONSILLITIS. IN FACT, I DO USE THE LEAVES OF BOTH PLANTS TO TREAT
MANY MIDWINTER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS.
W SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). IN GERMANY, WHERE HERBAL MEDICINE IS MORE
MAINSTREAM THAN IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES, PHYSICIANS RECOMMEND A HOT SAGE
GARGLE FOR TONSILLITIS. THE REASON APPEARS TO BE THAT SAGE HAS FAIRLY HIGH LEVELS OF
TANNINS, SUBSTANCES THAT HAVE A SOOTHING, ASTRINGENT ACTION AND AN ANTIMICROBIAL
EFFECT. SAGE IS LOADED WITH OTHER ANTISEPTICS, TOO.
VV CITRUS FRUITS AND OTHER FOODS CONTAINING VITAMIN C. THERE IS
SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE VITAMIN C IN CITRUS FRUIT IS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING THE STREP
BACTERIA THAT OFTEN CAUSE TONSILLITIS. VITAMIN C ALSO STIMULATES THE IMMUNE
SYSTEM TO PRODUCE MORE MACROPHAGES, SCAVENGER CELLS THAT LITERALLY GOBBLE UP
STREP BACTERIA.
BESIDES CITRUS FRUITS, GOOD PLANT SOURCES OF VITAMIN C INCLUDE BITTER MELON,
ROSEHIPS, BELL PEPPERS, RED PEPPER, POKEWEED SHOOTS, GUAVAS AND WATERCRESS.
V BLACKBERRY (RUBUS, VARIOUS SPECIES) AND PERSIMMON (DIOSPYROS
VIRGINIANA). BLACKBERRY ROOT AND PERSIMMON, EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION,
WERE EARLY AMERICAN FOLK REMEDIES FOR TONSILLITIS. SINCE BOTH ARE RICH IN TANNINS, THIS IS A RATIONAL FORMULA.
V DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). THE CHINESE SUGGEST SIMMERING
ABOUT AN OUNCE OF DANDELION ROOT IN TWO TO THREE CUPS OF BOILING WATER UNTIL ONLY
HALF OF THE LIQUID REMAINS. THE RESULTING SYRUP IS RECOMMENDED FOR TONSILLITIS.
^ ELDERBERRY (SAMBUCUS NIGRA). MANY CULTURES USE ELDERBERRY JUICE
TO TREAT TONSILLITIS, ACCORDING TO MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D.,
AUTHOR OF HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS. THIS MAKES
SENSE TO ME IN VIEW OF MEDICAL RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THIS HERB HAS ANTIVIRAL ACTION
AND HELPS TREAT INFLUENZA.
"> REDROOT (CEANOTHUS AMERICANUS). THE LATE ALABAMA HERBALIST
TOMMIE BASS, WHOM I RESPECTED, USED REDROOT, ALSO KNOWN AS NEW JERSEY TEA, FOR
TONSILLITIS, SORE THROAT, COUGH AND THRUSH, A TYPE OF THROAT INFECTION. THE ACTIVE CONSTITUENT SEEMS TO BE THE TANNINS. REDROOT CAN BE AS MUCH AS 10 PERCENT TANNINS.
V ASSORTED FRUITS. ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD, BLACKBERRY'S CLOSE RELATIVE, RASPBERRY, IS USED TO TREAT INFLAMED TONSILS. ONE RECIPE INVOLVES ADDING SUGAR
TO BOILED RASPBERRY JUICE, AND AFTER IT HAS COOLED, GARGLING AND SWALLOWING IT. NOW
THAT'S ONE MEDICINE I COULD ENJOY.
HEALING CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR SUGARY SYRUPS OF BLACKBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES, PAPAYA, RED GRAPES AND STRAWBERRIES. IN FACT, THIS APPROACH COULD BE
425
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
EASILY WORKED INTO WHAT I CALL TONSILADE: START WITH ONE CUP OF THE JUICE OF ANY
OR ALL OF THE ABOVE FRUITS. THEN ADD A LITTLE JUICE FROM ONE OF THE CITRUS FRUITS—
LEMON, LIME OR ORANGE—PLUS A BIT OF SAGE TEA AND SUGAR TO TASTE.
V HERBAL FORMULAS. BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF THE
HERBAL HANDBOOK, SUGGESTS A TREATMENT FOR TONSILLITIS THAT I MIGHT TRY MYSELF: A
TEA BREWED FROM TWO PARTS ECHINACEA, TWO PARTS GARDEN OR RED SAGE AND ONE PART
BALM OF GILEAD. IF YOU LIKE SWEET TEAS, YOU MAY ADD LICORICE, WHICH IS SOOTHING.
TOOTHACHE
T
HE CHOCO INDIANS HAVE LIVED FOR PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN EASTERN
PANAMA AND ADJACENT COLOMBIA. TODAY, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE DISAPPEARING, VICTIMS OF "DEVELOPMENT." I'VE WORKED MORE CLOSELY WITH THEM THAN WITH
ANY OTHER INDIAN GROUP.
AS EARLY AS 1960, MY CHOCO CONFIDANTS TOLD ME ABOUT A PLANT OF THE GENUS
PIPER, A CLOSE RELATIVE OF BLACK PEPPER, WHICH THEY USED AS A REMEDY FOR
TOOTHACHE. THEY HANDED ME A TWIG, AND WHEN I BIT INTO IT, MY MOUTH WENT NUMB.
YOU CERTAINLY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE CHOCOS' PLANT. BUT ANOTHER TROPICAL
TOOTHACHE HERB IS PROBABLY SITTING IN YOUR SPICE RACK RIGHT NOW. IT'S CLOVE, THE
FLOWER BUDS OF A TROPICAL TREE. OIL OF CLOVE CONTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF THE ANESTHETIC,
ANTISEPTIC CHEMICAL EUGENOL. CLOVES ARE 5 TO 20 TIMES RICHER IN EUGENOL THAN
OTHER EUGENOL SOURCES LISTED IN MY DATABASE. IN FACT, MANY DENTISTS USE IT AS A
DENTAL ANESTHETIC AND PAIN RELIEVER, ESPECIALLY WHEN DOING ROOT CANALS.
THERE'S NO NEED TO DEFINE TOOTHACHE. I'VE SUFFERED QUITE A FEW OVER THE YEARS,
AND TO THIS DAY, I STUPIDLY PROCRASTINATE ABOUT GOING TO THE DENTIST. IT TURNS OUT
THAT I'M NOT ALONE. AN ESTIMATED 98 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE DENTAL CAVITIES,
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL RESEARCH.
ALL THIS ADDS UP TO MILLIONS OF TOOTHACHES A YEAR. ANY PERSISTENT TOOTHACHE
SHOULD BE CHECKED BY A DENTIST, BUT FORTUNATELY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER ON YOUR
WAY THERE, THANKS TO SOME GOOD HERBS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR TOOTNACNE
THE USE OF HERBAL OILS FOR TOOTHACHE IS NOT NEW TO SCIENTIFIC DENTISTRY. AS
EARLY AS 1946, M. A. LESSER PUBLISHED A REVIEW IN THE JOURNAL DRUG AND COSMETIC INDUSTRY ENTITLED "PREPARATIONS FOR TOOTHACHE." HE NOTED THAT ESSENTIAL
426
TOOTHACHE
R H
JVIIIJI U WMIMI I
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER, I MENTIONED A PEPPER PLANT THAT THE CHOCO INDIANS
USE TO NUMB THE PAIN OF TOOTHACHE.
I ENCOUNTERED THIS PLANT AGAIN YEARS LATER, ON MY FIRST ECOTOUR TO IQUITOS, PERU.
MY INDIAN GUIDE POINTED TO THE PLANT AND REITERATED THAT IT RELIEVES TOOTHACHE. HE
PULLED IT UP BY THE ROOT, SCRAPED OFF THE DIRT AND INVITED ME TO BITE INTO IT. AS BEFORE, IT IMMEDIATELY ANESTHETIZED MY MOUTH.
FRUITS AND ROOTS OF SOME SPECIES OF PEPPER PLANTS ARE KNOWN TO CONTAIN ANESTHETIC COMPOUNDS. EVEN BLACK PEPPER CONTAINS SOME.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN THE WORLD'S JUNGLES HAVE
TOOTHACHE REMEDIES THAT REALLY WORK. AND THAT'S THE MAIN REASON I WROTE THIS
BOOK—TO SHOW THAT TRADITIONAL MEDICINE HAS LEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC VALUE.
SCIENTIFIC CRITICS COUNTER THAT "OLD FOLK TALES" ARE NO MATCH FOR WESTERN-STYLE
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION. BUT THE BASIS OF SCIENCE IS CAREFUL OBSERVATION, AND
THAT'S WHAT TRADITIONAL PEOPLES HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL—OBSERVING AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THE WORLD AROUND THEM.
IN GENERAL, TRADITIONAL PEOPLE HAVE MANAGED TO SELECT THE GOOD MEDICINES
AND HAVE REJECTED THE BAD, LEADING TO WHAT WE TODAY CALL FOLK MEDICINE. MOST OF
THESE FOLK MEDICINES HAVE THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF EXPERIMENTAL SELECTION BEHIND
THEM, AND FEW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE REACTIONS.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T SAY ABOUT OUR MODERN PHARMACEUTICALS, ONLY A FEW OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ON THIS EARTH FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS.
ALL TOO OFTEN, SYNTHETIC DRUGS TURN OUT TO BE HAZARDOUS. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE
NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICALS THAT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION ORDERS WITHDRAWN BECAUSE OF ADVERSE REACTIONS.
L 1
HERBAL OILS "ARE THE CHIEF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF TOOTHACHE PREPARATIONS. OF
THESE, OIL OF CLOVE AND EUGENOL ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MOST IMPORTANT..."
V \ \ CLOVE (SYZYGIUM AROMATIEUM). GERMANY'S COMMISSION E, THE BODY
OF NATURAL MEDICINE EXPERTS THAT MAKES HERBAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THAT COUNTRY'S
COUNTERPART OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA), ENDORSES OIL OF CLOVE AS
A LOCAL ANESTHETIC AND ANTISEPTIC FOR TOOTHACHE. EVEN A SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE REPORTING TO OUR FDA COMMENTED THAT OIL OF CLOVE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF 12 INGREDIENTS COMMONLY FOUND IN TOOTHACHE PREPARATIONS THAT WAS "SAFE AND EFIFECTIVE FOR
TEMPORARY USE ON A TOOTH WITH THROBBING PAIN."
YOU CAN BUY OVER-THE-COUNTER PREPARATIONS OF CLOVE OIL TO USE YOURSELF TO
NUMB TOOTHACHE. THE OIL IS PLACED DIRECTLY ON THE TOOTH, NOT INGESTED.
427
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
VV GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). A COMPRESS MADE WITH THIS HOT SPICE
SEEMS TO HELP ALLEVIATE TOOTHACHE PAIN. I'D ADD MORE HEAT TO SUCH A COMPRESS MYSELF, IN THE FORM OF RED PEPPER. BOTH GINGER AND RED PEPPER SEEM TO WORK LIKE THE
OLD MUSTARD PLASTERS. THEY ACT AS COUNTERIRRITANTS, MEANING THAT THE SURFACE IRRITATION OF THE GINGER OR RED PEPPER HELPS TO DIMINISH THE DEEPER TOOTHACHE PAIN.
TO MAKE A COMPRESS FOR YOUR TOOTH, MIX THE POWDERED SPICE OR SPICES IN
ENOUGH WATER TO FORM A GOOEY PASTE. THEN DIP IN A SMALL COTTON BALL AND WRING
IT OUT. APPLY THE COTTON DIRECTLY TO THE TOOTH WITHOUT LETTING IT TOUCH YOUR GUM.
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT, RINSE YOUR MOUTH AND TRY SOME OTHER REMEDY.
VV RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). IN 1992, WHILE THE WORLD
CELEBRATED COLUMBUS'S VOYAGE, I CELEBRATED THE INTRODUCTION OF RED PEPPER OUTSIDE AMERICA. COLUMBUS WAS INTRODUCED TO THE SPICE BY THE CARIBBEAN INDIANS.
WHEN APPLIED TO THE SKIN, CAPSAICIN, THE HOT INGREDIENT IN RED PEPPER,
BURNS FOR A WHILE, BUT IT DEPLETES THE ACTION OF SUBSTANCE P, THE CHEMICAL IN THE
BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSMITTING PAIN. IN ADDITION, RED PEPPER IS FAIRLY WELL
ENDOWED WITH SALICYLATES, ASPIRIN-LIKE CHEMICALS THAT CAN RELIEVE PAIN. IT'S NO
WONDER THAT THIS HERB IS AN OLD FOLK REMEDY FOR TOOTHACHE. TO USE RED PEPPER
ON A TOOTHACHE, USE THE COTTON COMPRESS TECHNIQUE DESCRIBED FOR GINGER.
VV TOOTHACHE TREE (ZANTHOXYLUM AMERICANUM). THIS TREE GOT ITS
NAME BECAUSE IT'S AN OLD FOLK REMEDY FOR TOOTHACHE. THE LATE ALABAMA FOLK
HERBALIST TOMMIE BASS RECOMMENDED IT RIGHT UP UNTIL HE DIED IN 1996. HE SUGGESTED CHEWING THE BARK OR MAKING A TEA OUT OF THE BARK OR BERRIES. I KNOW FROM
CHEWING ON THE TWIGS THAT IT HAS ANESTHETIC PROPERTIES. THIS ONE MAY BE A LITTLE
HARD TO LOCATE, BUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FIND THE DRIED HERB IN A SHOP THAT SPECIALIZES IN HERBS.
VV WILLOW (SALVE, VARIOUS SPECIES). FOR MY TOOTHACHES, I HAVE ON OCCASION RESORTED TO CHEWING A WAD OF WILLOW BARK AND THEN TAMPING IT INTO THE
PAINFUL TOOTH TO TEMPORARILY ALLEVIATE THE PAIN. WILLOW BARK CONTAINS SALICIN, A
CHEMICAL RELATIVE OF ASPIRIN THAT HAS CONSIDERABLE PAIN-RELIEVING POWER. YOU
CAN ALSO DRINK A TEA MADE FROM THE HERB OR TAKE A TINCTURE TO HELP BANISH THE
PAIN. (IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN, HOWEVER, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T USE ASPIRIN-LIKE HERBS, EITHER.)
V RHUBARB (RHEUM OFFICINALE). RHUBARB ROOT IS USED FOR TOOTHACHE IN
CHINA, WHERE THEY CALL IT DA-HUANG. THEY PREPARE A TOOTHACHE REMEDY BY FRYING
THE ROOT, THEN STEEPING IT IN ALCOHOL TO CREATE A TINCTURE. THEN, USING A COTTON
BALL, THEY APPLY THE TINCTURE DIRECTLY TO THE PAINFUL TOOTH FOR FIVE MINUTES.
I'D TRY THIS IF I COULDN'T FIND THE BETTER HERBS MENTIONED EARLIER. RHUBARB
CONTAINS AT LEAST SIX PAIN-RELIEVING CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS.
428
TOOTH DECAY
V SESAME (SESAMUM INDICUM), PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT
PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D., SHARES THIS FOURTH-CENTURY CHINESE FOLK
REMEDY FOR TOOTHACHE: BOIL ONE PART SESAME SEED WITH TWO PARTS WATER UNTIL HALF
THE LIQUID REMAINS. THE RESULTING DECOCTION, WHEN APPLIED DIRECDY TO THE TOOTH,
WAS SAID TO WORK WONDERS FOR TOOTHACHE AND GUM DISEASE. THERE'S GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT THIS TREATMENT MIGHT WORK, AS SESAME CONTAINS AT LEAST SEVEN
PAIN-RELIEVING COMPOUNDS.
TOOTH DECAY
A
N ESTIMATED 98 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE CAVITIES; MOST DEVELOP BETWEEN THE AGES OF 5 AND 15. RESEARCHERS BELIEVE THAT CAVITY FORMATION
DROPS OFF BY THE MIDTEENS BECAUSE THE BODY DEVELOPS IMMUNITY TO DECAYCAUSING BACTERIA, PRIMARILY SEVERAL TYPES OF STREPTOCOCCUS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR TOOTH DECAY
TOOTH DECAY WAS AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM BEFORE THE FLUORIDATION OF WATER
IN THIS CENTURY. FROM ANCIENT TIMES UNTIL THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, HERBALISTS PUT
A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT INTO STUDYING PLANTS THAT HELPED PRESERVE TEETH. THEY DISCOVERED QUITE A FEW THAT WERE VERY EFFECTIVE.
W%. TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS). IN ADDITION TO A GENEROUS ENDOWMENT OF SEVERAL COMPOUNDS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO PREVENT TOOTH DECAY, TEA ALSO CONTAINS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TOOTH-PRESERVING FLUORIDE.^
GREEN TEA MAY CONTAIN MORE FLUORIDE THAN BLACK TEA. TO GET POTENT
DECAY-PREVENTIVE ACTION FROM JUST THE
FLUORIDE IN TEA, YOU'D HAVE TO DRINK
THREE TO TEN CUPS A DAY. BUT YOU ACTUALLY NEED LESS BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHER
ANTI-CAVITY COMPOUNDS IN TEA. (THERE'S
ALSO A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE WATER YOU
USE FOR YOUR TEA ALREADY CONTAINS FLUORIDE.) IF YOU SWEETEN YOUR TEA, TRY USING
LICORICE INSTEAD OF DECAY-PROMOTING
SUGAR. TO DO THIS, SIMPLY BREW YOUR REGULAR TEA WITH A LITTLE DRIED LICORICE ROOT.
TEA
TEA, WHICH IS NATIVE TO CHINA, WAS
ORIGINALLY USED TO FLAVOR WATER THAT
HAD BEEN BOILED FOR PURIFICATION.
429
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
W BAY (LAURUS NOB HIS). BAY'S AROMATIC OIL CONTAINS A POWERFUL BACTERIA KILLING CHEMICAL (1,8-CINEOLE) THAT IS USED IN SOME DENTIFRICES. CHECK
THE TOOTHPASTE LABEL FOR BAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS HERB'S DECAYPREVENTING POTENTIAL. IF YOU DON'T FIND A TOOTHPASTE CONTAINING THIS INGREDIENT
IN YOUR PHARMACY, YOU MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK AT YOUR LOCAL HEALTH FOOD STORE.
W BLOODROOT (SANGUINARIA OFFICINALIS). MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT
DENTAL-CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING BLOODROOT HELP REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DENTAL
PLAQUE DEPOSITED ON THE TEETH IN AS LITTLE AS EIGHT DAYS. BLOODROOT CONTAINS A COMPOUND KNOWN AS SANGUINARINE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLAQUE-REDUCING EFFECT.
SANGUINARINE CHEMICALLY BINDS TO DENTAL PLAQUE AND HELPS PREVENT IT FROM
ADHERING TO THE TEETH. AND SINCE DENTAL PLAQUE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GUM DISEASE
AS WELL AS TOOTH DECAY, BLOODROOT IS ALSO A GOOD CHOICE FOR ADULTS WHO ARE
FIGHTING GUM DISEASE.
YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BLOODROOT'S PLAQUE-FIGHTING POTENTIAL BY LOOKING
FOR TOOTHPASTES AND MOUTHWASHES THAT CONTAIN THIS HERB. ONE POPULAR BRAND IS
VIADENT.
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). IN ADDITION TO CONTAINING THE BACTERIAKILLING, NONSUGAR SWEETENER GLYCYRRHIZIN, LICORICE ALSO CONTAINS INDOLE, A POWERFUL
DECAY-PREVENTIVE COMPOUND.
^V PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). BEFORE I RETIRED AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF AGRICULTURE'S EXPERT ON MEDICINAL PLANTS, PEOPLE ALWAYS RIBBED ME ABOUT
KEEPING PEANUTS AS MUNCHIES IN MY OFFICE. I DID IT BECAUSE I LIKE PEANUTS. BUT I
HAVE LEARNED THAT RESEARCHERS AT THE EASTMAN DENTAL CENTER IN ROCHESTER, NEW
YORK, HAVE SHOWN THAT PEANUTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO CAUSE CAVITIES THAN PRETZELS. PRETZELS, IN TURN, ARE LESS LIKELY TO CAUSE CAVITIES THAN DRIED FRUIT, POTATO CHIPS,
SALTINES, GRAHAM CRACKERS, FRUIT, CHOCOLATE AND ANYTHING CONTAINING SUGAR.
I OFTEN MIXED MY DECAY-PREVENTIVE PEANUTS WITH SUGARY, DECAY-PROMOTING
RAISINS. IF I WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CAVITIES, I GUESS I'D GO WITH JUST THE
PEANUTS.
VV STEVIA (STEVIA REBAUDIANA). THIS SWEET HERB FROM PARAGUAY IS ANOTHER
TASTY, NONSUGAR SWEETENER. SIMPLY BUY A BOX OF TEA AND USE A PINCH WHENEVER YOU
WANT TO SWEETEN A BEVERAGE. YOU'LL FIND THAT IT'S EXTREMELY SWEET. (COME TO THINK OF
IT, THIS IS GOOD ADVICE FOR ANYONE WHO'S TRYING TO CUT CALORIES, TOO.)
VV TOOTHACHE TREE (ZANTHOXYHAN AMERICANUM). THIS HERB IS BEST KNOWN
FOR MINIMIZING THE HORRIBLE PAIN OF TOOTHACHE. IT ALSO CONTAINS A BACTERIA-KILLING
CHEMICAL THAT CAN HELP PREVENT TOOTH DECAY. THE LATE ALABAMA HERBALIST TOMMIE
BASS RECOMMENDED CHEWING TWIGS. YOU COULD MAKE A CONCENTRATED TEA TO SWISH IN
YOUR MOUTH. YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND THE HERB ONLY IN SOME SPECIALTY HERB SHOPS.
430
TUBERCULOSI S
^*> WILD BERGAMOT (MONARDA FISTULOSA). THIS HERB CAN CONTAIN UP TO
30,000 PARTS PER MILLION OF THE DECAY-PREVENTIVE COMPOUND GERANIOL. BERGAMOT
HAS ABOUT 20 TIMES MORE GERANIOL THAN JJ»»
TEA HAS.
WILD BERGAMOT ALSO CONTAINS A
GREAT DEAL OF THYMOL, ANOTHER POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC THAT IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN LISTERINE, THE POPULAR
MOUTHWASH. BUT WHY STOP AT JUST
THYMOL? MY OWN RECIPE FOR A POTENT
MOUTHWASH CONTAINS SEVERAL ORAL ANTISEPTICS THAT CAN HELP PREVENT TOOTH
DECAY.
V CHAPARRAL (LARREA DIVARICATA). ONE SCIENTIFIC STUDY, INITIATED
BY RESEARCHERS WHO KNEW THAT CHAPARRAL HAS BEEN USED AS A FOLK REMEDY
FOR TOOTHACHE, SHOWED THAT CHAPARRAL
MOUTHWASH REDUCED CAVITIES BY 75
PERCENT. AND SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED
THAT ONE COMPOUND IN THE PLANT,
NORDIHYDROGUARIETIC ACID, IS A POTENT
ANTISEPTIC. JUST BREW A TEA WITH CHAPARRAL TO USE AS A MOUTHWASH, BUT BE
CAREFUL TO SPIT IT ALL OUT WITHOUT SWAL- ™"
LOWING ANY.
V MYRRH (COMMIPHORA, VARIOUS SPECIES). MYRRH'S ANTISEPTIC USES GO
BACK TO BIBLICAL TIMES. TINCTURE OF MYRRH HAS BOTH DEODORANT AND DISINFECTING
PROPERTIES, AND IT CAN BE USED AS A DENTAL RINSE, GARGLE AND MOUTHWASH.
HERBAL ANTISEPTIC
MOUTHWASH
USE THIS MOUTHWASH AFTER DINNER BY
SIMPLY SWIZZLING SOME AROUND IN YOUR
MOUTH. THEN, IF YOU ENJOY HERBAL LIQUEURS, GO AHEAD AND SWALLOW IT; YOU'LL
FIND THAT IT'S DELICIOUS. THIS MIXTURE CONTAINS MORE THAN 20 ANTISEPTIC COMPOUNDS
AND COULD HELP PREVENT TOOTH DECAY.

I
N LATE 1995,1 ADDRESSED A GROUP OF MORE THAN 100 PHYSICIANS AT FLOWER
HOSPITAL IN TOLEDO, OHIO. AFTER MY TALK ON HERBAL MEDICINE, ONE OLDER
DOCTOR DREW ME ASIDE AND TOLD ME THIS STORY: DECADES EARLIER, WHEN HE WAS
431
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
MUCH YOUNGER, HE MET A MAN WHO HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO A SANATORIUM FOR
TUBERCULOSIS (TB). THAT WAS DURING THE TIME WHEN SANATORIUMS WERE IN VOGUE
AND PEOPLE WITH TB WERE USUALLY SENT AWAY TO THEM FOR THEIR REMAINING DAYS.
ONCE CONSIGNED TO A SANATORIUM, FEW PEOPLE EVER WENT HOME AGAIN.
THE MAN THE DOCTOR DESCRIBED, HOWEVER, HAD SOMEHOW BEEN GIVEN A
REPRIEVE. AND THIS WAS THE CURIOUS THING. ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, THE PATIENT
WITH TUBERCULOSIS HAPPENED TO FIND A DISCARDED LOAD OF ONIONS ON THE GROUNDS
OF THE SANATORIUM. TIRED AND DEPLETED FROM TB, HE BEGAN EATING THE ONIONS,
ENJOYING SEVERAL A DAY. WITHIN A MONTH HE WAS WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE
INSTITUTION.
NOW THERE'S A STORY TO DELIGHT AND INTRIGUE A PLANT MEDICINE ENTHUSIAST. IT
TURNS OUT THAT ONIONS REALLY DO HAVE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES, SO IT'S JUST POSSIBLE
THAT THIS MAN'S MULTI-ONION DIET REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS CURE.
AN SCOURGE MAKES A COMELACK
TUBERCULOSIS IS A CHRONIC, USUALLY CONTAGIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTION THAT CAN
SPREAD THROUGH THE BODY IN THE BLOODSTREAM AND LYMPH NODES, BUT IT USUALLY
FOCUSES ON THE LUNGS. TO BECOME INFECTED, MOST PEOPLE NEED TO BE REPEATEDLY
EXPOSED—BY LIVING OR WORKING AT CLOSE QUARTERS WITH A CARRIER OF THE DISEASE,
FOR EXAMPLE.
IF YOU SPEND 8 HOURS A DAY FOR SIX MONTHS OR 24 HOURS A DAY FOR TWO MONTHS
WITH ANYONE WITH ACTIVE TB, THERE'S A 50 PERCENT CHANCE THAT YOU WILL GET IT.
IT'S NO WONDER THAT THE DISEASE CENTERS IN POVERTY-STRICKEN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE
LIVE CROWDED TOGETHER WITHOUT ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE.
FORTUNATELY, MY OWN FAMILY HAD LOTS OF LIVING SPACE IN PANAMA 30 YEARS
AGO WHEN WE LEARNED THAT OUR HVE-IN MAID HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR TB. MY WHOLE
FAMILY IMMEDIATELY WAS CHECKED FOR THE DISEASE. LUCKILY, THE TEST RESULTS
SHOWED THAT WE WERE ALL TB-NEGATIVE.
TB IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEATH FROM INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, CAUSING 26 PERCENT OF AVOIDABLE ADULT DEATHS AND 6.7 PERCENT OF ALL
DEATHS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THOSE AT HIGHEST RISK INCLUDE HEALTH-CARE WORKERS,
LONG-TERM HOSPITAL PATIENTS, PRISON INMATES AND GUARDS AND PEOPLE WITH HIV,
THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS.
THE BACTERIA GENERALLY REMAIN DORMANT AFTER ENTERING THE BODY, AND ONLY
ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY COME DOWN WITH OVERT TB.
THE REMAINING 90 PERCENT PRODUCE TB ANTIBODIES, SIGNIFYING EXPOSURE, BUT
THEY SHOW NO SIGNS OF INFECTION AND CANNOT SPREAD THE DISEASE.
IN MOST CASES, ANTIBIOTICS ERADICATE TB. BUT IN RECENT YEARS, AS AIDS HAS
432
TUBERCULOSIS
TRIGGERED AN UPSURGE IN CASES, THE BACTERIA HAVE BECOME RESISTANT TO ONE OR
MORE OF THE STANDARD ANTIBIOTICS. CURRENTLY, ABOUT 1 PERCENT OF NEW TB CASES
IN NEW YORK CITY ARE CAUSED BY BACTERIA RESISTANT TO ONE ANTIBIOTIC, WHILE UP TO
7 PERCENT OF RECURRENT CASES ARE RESISTANT TO TWO OR MORE ANTIBIOTICS. PEOPLE
WHO HAVE TB THAT IS RESISTANT TO MULTIPLE DRUGS HAVE ONLY ABOUT A 50 PERCENT
CHANCE OF SURVIVAL, ABOUT THE SAME CHANCE AS PEOPLE HAD BEFORE ANTIBIOTICS
WERE DEVELOPED.
TB IS VERY SERIOUS. IF YOU TEST POSITIVE, BY ALL MEANS GET EVALUATED BY A
PHYSICIAN. IF YOUR DOCTOR RECOMMENDS MEDICATION, TAKE IT, AND TAKE ALL OF IT.

IN ADDITION TO YOUR MEDICAL TREATMENT, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT
MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL.
V*^, ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). CONFRONTED WITH ANY BACTERIA, INCLUDING THE TYPE THAT CAUSES TB, I'D TAKE ECHINACEA TO BOOST MY IMMUNE
SYSTEM EVEN AFTER I STARTED ON ANTIBIOTICS. THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I DID IN 1996 WHEN
I MAY HAVE CONTRACTED LYME DISEASE. I TOOK TWO 450-MILLIGRAM CAPSULES OF ECHINACEA THREE TIMES A DAY, HOPING TO SPUR MY IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RESIST THE BACTERIA.
ALTERNATIVELY, YOU MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER TRYING UP TO 40 DROPS OF TINCTURE THREE TIMES
A DAY. (ALTHOUGH ECHINACEA CAN CAUSE YOUR TONGUE TO TINGLE OR GO NUMB TEMPORARILY, THIS EFFECT IS HARMLESS.)
V W FORSYTHIA (FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA). THE CHINESE USE FORSYTHIA AS AN ANTIBACTERIAL ANTISEPTIC. STRONG TEAS ARE VERY ACTIVE AGAINST SEVERAL BACTERIA. THE
PLANT HAS BEEN USED CLINICALLY AGAINST TB, OFTEN COMBINED WITH HONEYSUCKLE. TO
FIGHT A VARIETY OF INFECTIONS, I USE FORSYTHIA TWIGS IN A 1:2 RATIO WITH HONEYSUCKLE IN
A TEA OR HOT LEMONADE. I THINK THIS APPROACH WOULD BE GOOD FOR TREATING TB.
V*^ GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). IF I SUSPECTED THAT I HAD TB, I'D TAKE GARLIC
UNTIL I COULD GET TO A PHYSICIAN, AND MAYBE EVEN AFTERWARD. THE CHINESE USE GARLIC
TO TREAT TB, WITH DECENT RESULTS, I HEAR. IF I FEARED THAT I'D BEEN EXPOSED TO TB, I
WOULD TAKE AT LEAST ONE GARLIC CAPSULE A DAY, AND I'D MAKE SURE THE LABEL SAID THAT
EACH CAPSULE WAS STANDARDIZED TO THE EQUIVALENT OF AT LEAST ONE GRAM OF FRESH
GARLIC.
IN THEIR EXCELLENT NEW BOOK, GARLIC: THE SCIENCE AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND RELATED SPECIES, HEINRICH P. KOCH, PH.D., PROFESSOR
OF PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, AND LARRY D. LAWSON, PH.D., A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT NATURE'S WAY, AN
HERB COMPANY IN SPRINGVILLE, UTAH, SUGGEST THAT GARLIC MAY HELP ANTIBIOTICS DO
THEIR JOB IN FIGHTING TB. STUDIES SHOW THAT ALLICIN, THE ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUND
IN GARLIC, ENHANCES THE ACTION OF SUCH ANTIBIOTICS AS CHLORAMPHENICOL
433
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
(CHLOROMYCETIN) AND STREPTOMYCIN AGAINST TB BACTERIA.
V"*^ HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA JAPONICA). HONEYSUCKLE HAS BEEN USED FOR
CENTURIES IN CHINA TO TREAT A VARIETY OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING TB, BRONCHITIS, COLDS, FLU AND PNEUMONIA. HONEYSUCKLE FLOWER EXTRACTS ARE STRONGLY ACTIVE
AGAINST SEVERAL BACTERIA, INCLUDING THOSE THAT CAUSE TB.
I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO USE THIS HERB IF I HAD TB. IN SUMMER I'D MAKE A TEA
WITH A HANDFUL OF FLOWERS PER CUP OF BOILING WATER AND DRINK UP TO THREE CUPS A
DAY. IN WINTER I'D BOIL TWIGS AND DRIED LEAVES TO MAKE A BITTER TEA, WHICH I
WOULD MASK WITH LEMON AND HONEY, TURNING IT INTO HOT HONEYSUCKLE LEMONADE.
W V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). SINCE, ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE,
LICORICE HAS UP TO 33 PERCENT ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS ON A DRY-WEIGHT BASIS, IT'S
SMALL WONDER THAT THE CHINESE USE LICORICE TO TREAT TB. I OFTEN USE LICORICE ROOTS,
WHICH ARE ALSO ANTIVIRAL, TO SWEETEN MY HERBAL TEAS WHEN I HAVE COLDS, AND I DRANK
LICORICE TEA WHEN I WAS FLIRTING WITH LYME DISEASE. FD PROBABLY ADD HCORICE TO ANY
HERBAL PREPARATION I TOOK FOR TB IF I WERE BATDING THIS DISEASE.
W EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS). THIS IS ANOTHER HERB USED IN ASIA
TO TREAT TB. UNLESS YOU LIVE IN TROPICAL AMERICA OR IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA,
YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE FINDING FRESH EUCALYPTUS LEAVES, BUT THE ESSENTIAL OIL IS
READILY AVAILABLE AT SHOPS THAT SELL AROMATHERAPY SUPPLIES.
TRY A DROP OR TWO ADDED TO WATER OR TEA. THAT'S A ROUGH EQUIVALENT OF THE
CHINESE DOSE. YOU CANNOT INGEST MANY ESSENTIAL OILS, BUT EUCALYPTUS IS AN EXCEPTION, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET OVERLY ENTHUSIASTIC. DON'T USE MORE THAN A
DROP OR TWO: THIS IS POWERFUL STUFF.
W ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONIONS HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION AS THEIR CLOSE RELATIVE, GARLIC, SO I WASN'T SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT STORY ABOUT THE
TB SANATORIUM RESIDENT WHO CURED HIMSELF BY EATING ONIONS. IF I HAD TB, FD EAT
LOTS OF GARLIC AND ONIONS.
ULCERS
B
ACK IN 1991,1 HAD AN INJURY THAT CAUSED THE MOST EXCRUCIATING PAIN
I'VE EVER HAD. MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED LARGE DOSES OF NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS), WHICH ARE POWERFUL PAIN RELIEVERS.
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME AND FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER TAKEN NSAIDS, THESE
DRUGS ARE ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR CAUSING ULCERS. LUCKILY FOR ME, HOWEVER, I KNEW
434
ULCERS
ABOUT LICORICE, AND I STILL REGULARLY SWEETEN SOME HERB TEAS WITH IT. NOW I'D SAY
THAT I MAY OWE MY FREEDOM FROM ULCERS TO THIS HABIT.
I NEVER GOT AN ULCER FROM TAKING ALL THOSE NSAIDS. AND EVEN MORE
AMAZING, I NEVER DEVELOPED ONE DURING THE 30 YEARS THAT I WAS EMPLOYED BY
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
I DON'T THINK THIS PROVES THAT I HAVE A STOMACH OF STEEL. RATHER, I THINK I
OWE MY FREEDOM FROM ULCERS TO THE FACT THAT SWEET LICORICE ROOT CONTAINS COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE REMARKABLE ANTI-ULCER EFFECTS. AND PERHAPS I ALSO BENEFITED
FROM EATING MANY OF THE ULCER-PREVENTING HERBS AND FOODS DISCUSSED IN THIS
CHAPTER.
OORE TKA T WON'T HEAL
TECHNICALLY, AN ULCER IS ANY SORE. BUT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE AN
ULCER, THEY ALMOST ALWAYS MEAN AN INTERNAL SORE IN THE LINING OF THE STOMACH OR
DUODENUM, THE GATEWAY TO THE SMALL INTESTINE JUST DOWNSTREAM FROM THE
STOMACH. THESE KINDS OF ULCERS ARE ALSO CALLED PEPTIC ULCERS BECAUSE THEY
OCCUR IN AREAS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO THE DIGESTIVE ENZYME PEPSIN.
AN ESTIMATED 10 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HAVE AN ULCER AT SOME POINT IN LIFE,
WITH ABOUT ONE MILLION NEW DIAGNOSES A YEAR. MEN ARE FOUR TIMES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN WOMEN, AND RISK RISES WITH AGE. ALLERGIES SOMEHOW MAKE PEOPLE MORE
ULCER-PRONE: IN ONE STUDY, 98 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH PEPTIC ULCERS ALSO HAD RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES.
NOT LONG AGO, SCIENTISTS THOUGHT THAT STRESS CAUSED ULCERS. IT MAY WELL PLAY
A ROLE, BUT NOW WE KNOW THAT THE REAL CULPRIT IS OFTEN AN INFECTION CAUSED BY THE
BACTERIA HELICOBACTER PYLORI, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS CAMPYLOBACTER PYLORI. SIMPLY
HAVING H. PYLORI BACTERIA IN YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU WILL GET AN ULCER.
HOWEVER, MORE THAN 75 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH ULCERS SHOW EVIDENCE OFH. PYLORI
INFECTION, AND THAT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE PAGES OF THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR ULCERS
THESE DAYS, DOCTORS GENERALLY TREAT ULCERS CAUSED BY H. PYLORI WITH A COMBINATION OF ANTIBIOTICS PLUS BISMUTH (PEPTO-BISMOL) OR SIMILAR DRUGS. IN ADDITION, YOU MIGHT TRY A NUMBER OF HERBAL ANTI-ULCER APPROACHES.
W V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). HOW ABOUT CANDIED GINGER AS AN HERBAL
ALTERNATIVE TO CIMETIDINE (TAGAMET), RANITIDINE (ZANTAC) AND FAMOTIDINE (PEPCID)?
IT WOULD SURE TASTE A LOT BETTER!
GINGER IS WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY, BUT IT'S CONSIDER435
CHOOSIN G TH E HERBS THA T HEA L
ABLY LESS KNOWN AS AN HERBAL TREATMENT
FOR ULCERS. IN FACT, GINGER CONTAINS
11 COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED
ANTI-ULCER EFFECTS. THESE CHEMICAL
COMPOUNDS ARE A REAL MOUTHFUL, BUT I
THINK THAT YOU MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING
TO KNOW JUST HOW MUCH ANTI-ULCER
CHEMISTRY CAN BE CONCENTRATED IN A
SINGLE, HUMBLE SPICE. HERE THEY ARE IN
ORDER, FROM MOST TO LEAST ABUNDANT: 6-
SHOGAOL, 6-GINGEROL, 8-SHOGAOL, 8-GINGEROL, 10-GINGEROL, AR-CURCUMENE,
BETA-BISALENE, 6-GINGEDIOL, BETASESQUIPHELLANDRENE, 6-GINGERDIONE AND 6-
PARADOL.
EATING HONEY-CANDIED GINGER IS A
PLEASANT-TASTING TREATMENT FOR ULCERS,
ACCORDING TO PAUL SCHULICK, NEW ENGLAND HERBALIST AND AUTHOR OF GINGER:
COMMON SPICE AND WONDER DRUG. THE
COMBINATION OF HONEY AND GINGER IS
PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE, HE NOTES. IN ADDITION TO THE ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS
THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM GINGER, HONEY
HAS ANTIBACTERIAL ACTION, AND THE TWO TOGETHER SEEM TO PRODUCE SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS. GINGER IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN MY
ANTI-ULCER FRUIT COCKTAIL.
W V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA), GERMAN PHYSICIANS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN MORE OPEN TO HERBAL MEDICINE THAN
DOCTORS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY HAVE
RESEARCHED HERBAL ALTERNATIVES EXTENSIVELY. COMMISSION E, THE BODY OF SCIENTISTS
THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN COUNTERPART OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, APPROVES LICORICE AS AN ULCER TREATMENT. THIS RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON THE MEDICAL TRADITIONS OF ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE, PLUS LITERALLY DOZENS OF
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES.
LICORICE CONTAINS SEVERAL ANTI-ULCER COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING GLYCYRRHIZIC ACID.
LICORICE AND ITS EXTRACTS ARE SAFE FOR NORMAL USE IN MODERATE AMOUNTS, UP TO ABOUT
ANTI-ULCER FRUIT COCKTAIL
EVERY ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS IN THIS TASTY,
NO-FAT DESSERT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS
OF STOMACH-SOOTHING, ANTI-ULCER COMPOUNDS. YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A HARD TIME
THINKING OF THIS SCRUMPTIOUS TREAT AS POTENT
MEDICINE, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
BANANAS
PINEAPPLE
BLUEBERRIES
GROUND CINNAMON
GROUND CLOVES
GROUND GINGER
HONEY (OPTIONAL)
CUT UP THE BANANAS AND PINEAPPLE; THE
AMOUNT AND PROPORTIONS WILL VARY DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'RE
SERVING AND WHICH FRUITS YOU LIKE BEST.
PLACE THEM IN A SERVING BOWL AND ADD THE
BLUEBERRIES. SEASON TO TASTE WITH THE CINNAMON, CLOVES AND GINGER (TRY TO BE GENEROUS) AND SWEETEN WITH THE HONEY (IF
USING).
IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN ALSO MAKE A BETWEENMEAL ANTI-ULCER DRINK BY BLENDING BLUEBERRY JUICE, PINEAPPLE JUICE, A BANANA AND
THE SPICES LISTED ABOVE. GARNISH EACH
SERVING WITH A PEPPERMINT SPRIG.
436
ULCERS
THREE CUPS OF TEA A DAY. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM USE—DAILY USE FOR LONGER THAN SIX
WEEKS—OR INGESTION OF EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS CAN PRODUCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS
HEADACHE, LETHARGY, SODIUM AND WATER RETENTION, EXCESSIVE LOSS OF POTASSIUM AND
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
THESE SIDE EFFECTS, HOWEVER, CAN BE LARGELY ELIMINATED BY USING A SLIGHTLY
PROCESSED FORM OF THE HERB CALLED DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED LICORICE (DGL). IN ONE
GOOD STUDY, DGL WAS AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE IN SPEEDING ULCER HEALING AS THE
NEWEST CLASS OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS, CALLED HISTAMINE-BLOCKING AGENTS, THAT
WERE DESIGNED TO DO THIS. DGL ALSO SEEMS TO PROTECT THE DIGESTIVE LINING FROM
ASPIRIN'S ULCER-PROMOTING EFFECTS.
COMMERCIAL LICORICE PREPARATIONS CONTAINING DGL ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN
NATURAL FOOD STORES THAT SELL HERBS. IF YOU HAVE AN ULCER, THIS IS THE PREFERRED
FORM OF LICORICE TO TAKE, BUT CLEARLY SOME OF THE POWER OF THE HERB IS LOST WITH
THE LOST GLYCYRRHIZIN.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE LICORICE FROM TIME TO TIME AS AN ULCER PREVENTIVE, YOU
CAN DO WHAT I DO. WHEN YOU'RE BREWING SOME OTHER HERBAL TEA, ADD A LITTLE
LICORICE. LICORICE BY ITSELF MAKES A SWEET, PLEASANT-TASTING TEA, AND WHEN ADDED
TO OTHER TEAS, IT SERVES AS A SWEETENER.
VV*. YELLOWROOT (XANTHORRHIZA SIMPLICISSIMA). IF THE LATE ALABAMA
HERBALIST TOMMIE BASS'S EXPERIENCE WITH YELLOWROOT CAN BE BELIEVED—AND I'M INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT—THIS HERB IS WORTH A TRY. (FOR DETAILS, SEE "FOLK WISDOM VINDICATED AGAIN" ON PAGE 438.) YELLOWROOT IS AN ANTIBIOTIC THAT SHOULD WORK BY
HELPING TO CONTROL H. PYLORI BACTERIA.
I PERSONALLY WOULD TRY A TEASPOON OF YELLOWROOT TINCTURE IN JUICE OR TEA ONCE OR
TWICE A DAY BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE ANTIBIOTICS MY DOCTOR MIGHT PRESCRIBE FOR ULCER.
IF YOU'RE ALREADY TAKING ANTIBIOTICS, HOWEVER, DO NOT MAKE THIS SWITCH WITHOUT FIRST
DISCUSSING IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. BE WARNED: UNTREATED H. PYLORI VIRUS IS LINKED TO
STOMACH CANCER, SO YOU MUST TAKE THIS CONDITION SERIOUSLY.
W BANANA (MUSA PARADISIAC A). BANANAS ARE AN OLD FOLK REMEDY FOR
MANY GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY SOOTHE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT. AND
STUDIES WITH EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS SUGGEST THAT BANANAS DO, IN FACT, HAVE AN ANTIULCER EFFECT.
ONE RESEARCHER NOTED THAT "BANANAS MAY BE ANOTHER USEFUL ADDITION TO
SUCH WELL-ESTABLISHED ANTI-ULCER FOODS AS RAW CABBAGE, GREEN TEA, GARLIC AND
LEGUMES."
VV CABBAGE (BRASSICA OLERACEA). RAW CABBAGE JUICE IS A HALLOWED FOLK
REMEDY FOR ULCERS. IT TURNS OUT THAT CABBAGE AND ITS JUICE CONTAIN CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNTS OF TWO COMPOUNDS WITH ANTI-ULCER ACTIVITY, GLUTAMINE AND S-METHYL-METHIONINE.
437
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
I 1
FOLK WISDOM VINDICATED AGAIN
HERE'S A STORY I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT HERBAL FOLK WISDOM AND MODERN SCIENCE. AN OLD HERBALIST WHOM I RESPECTED, THE LATE A. L. "TOMMIE" BASS, WHO HAD A
LITTLE HERB FARMETTE OUTSIDE LEESBURG, ALABAMA, BECAME THE SUBJECT OF A BOOK, HERBAL
MEDICINE: PAST AND PRESENT BY JOHN K. CRELLIN AND JANE PHILPOTT, PUBLISHED BY DUKE
UNIVERSITY PRESS IN 1989.
IN THIS BOOK CRELLIN AND PHILPOTT DISCUSSED SOME 300 HERBS THAT TOMMIE RECOMMENDED OVER THE YEARS. FOR EACH HERB, THE AUTHORS RECOUNTED WHAT TOMMIE HAD
TO SAY ABOUT THE HERB AND THEN INTERPRETED HIS ACCOUNT IN THE LIGHT OF PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH.
ONE HERB THAT TOMMIE RECOMMENDED FOR ULCERS WAS YELLOWROOT, WHICH CONTAINS SOME OF THE SAME CHEMICALS AS GOLDENSEAL. HERE'S WHAT TOMMIE SAID ABOUT
IT: "MORE PEOPLE ARE TAKING IT NOW FOR ULCERS THAN ANYTHING WE KNOW OF. I'VE USED
YELLOWROOT TO HELP SO MANY PEOPLE WITH THEIR ULCERS. THEY COME BACK TO THANK ME
AND OFFER ME MONEY. BUT I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS FOR THE MONEY. I'M. IN IT TO HELP
PEOPLE. AND YELLOWROOT CAN HELP AN ULCER, MORE THAN THAT TAGAMET. THEY THROW
AWAY THEIR TAGAMET ONCE THEY TRY THE YELLOWROOT."
BUT CRELLIN AND PHILPOTT NOTED THAT "LITTLE PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS TO
SUGGEST ANY SPECIFIC ACTIVITY ON ULCERS" FROM YELLOWROOT'S KNOWN ACTIVE COMPOUNDS, MOST NOTABLY BERBERINE.
PERHAPS THEY WERE UNDERSTATING THE CASE. WHEN I CHECKED MY DATABASE, I
SAW THAT BERBERINE HAD, IN FACT, BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE ANTI-ULCER EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, CRELLIN AND PHILPOTT'S COMMENTARY WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE DISCOVERY THAT MOST
ULCERS ARE CAUSED BY BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. YELLOWROOT IS A POTENT ANTIBIOTIC, AND
BERBERINE IS A COMPOUND THAT HAS ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTS EVEN AT VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS, MEANING THAT A FEW SPOONFULS OF TINCTURE A DAY MIGHT WELL CURE AN ULCER,
JUST AS TOMMIE CLAIMED.
I'M INCLUDING THIS STORY AS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW OFTEN FOLK WISDOM
ABOUT PLANTS TURNS OUT TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY VALID. IT ALSO SERVES AS A REMINDER THAT
SOMETIMES SCIENTISTS NEED TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE INITIALLY
REJECTED AS UNSCIENTIFIC, ESPECIALLY WHEN NEW DATA ACCUMULATE. THE WISDOM
GAINED BY LONG EXPERIENCE MAY PREVAIL.
I • J
MELVYN WERBACH, M.D., ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND AUTHOR OF THE
EXCELLENT NUTRITIONAL INFLUENCES ON ILLNESS, CITES A STUDY OF PEOPLE WITH ULCERS
WHO WERE GIVEN RAW CABBAGE JUICE AS A TREATMENT. NINETY-TWO PERCENT SHOWED
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THREE WEEKS COMPARED WITH 32 PERCENT OF THOSE
438
ULCERS
TAKING A LOOKALIKE TREATMENT (A PLACEBO) WITHOUT CABBAGE JUICE.
IN STUDIES OF JUST THE ACTIVE COMPOUND GLUTAMINE, DAILY DOSES OF 1,600 MILLIGRAMS PROVED AS EFFECTIVE AS CONVENTIONAL ANTACIDS IN TREATING ULCERS.
THE FOLK RECOMMENDATION FOR TREATING ULCERS IS TO DRINK ONE QUART OF RAW
CABBAGE JUICE A DAY. THAT MAY BE HARD TO SWALLOW, SO I OFFER A RECIPE THAT MIGHT
HELP: ANTI-ULCER CABBAGE SOUP.
VV CALENDULA (CALENDULA OFFICINALIS). CALENDULA, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS
POT MARIGOLD, HAS ANTIBACTERIAL, ANTIVIRAL AND IMMUNE-STIMULATING PROPERTIES.
CALENDULA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC STOMACH INFLAMMATION, WHAT DOCTORS CALL HYPERSECRETORY GASTRITIS, A CONDITION THAT
HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ULCERS.
CLINICAL TRIALS IN EUROPE SUGGEST
THAT THIS HERB MAY ALSO BE USEFUL FOR
TREATING ULCERS.
YOU CAN MAKE A TEA WITH THE
DRIED HERB OR TAKE A TINCTURE. I PERSONALLY ENJOY A CUP OR TWO OF TEA
MADE WITH ABOUT FIVE TEASPOONS OF
FRESH CALENDULA FLOWERS. IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD WITH LEMON BALM AND
LEMON.
I'VE ALSO ENJOYED CALENDULA
LIQUEUR (THE PETALS IMPART THEIR
GOLDEN COLOR TO THE BEVERAGE) BUT I
CAN'T RECOMMEND THAT FOR TREATING
ULCERS. IN FACT, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GO
EASY ON ALCOHOL IF YOU HAVE AN ULCER.
FINNISH RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT ALCOHOL ABUSE INCREASES
THE RISK OF H. PYLORI INFECTION BY 500
PERCENT. IF YOU HAVE HAY FEVER, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID TAKING
THIS HERB, BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ALLERGIC TO RAGWEED MIGHT REACT TO
CALENDULA AS WELL. IF YOU TAKE IT AND
HAVE A REACTION—ITCHING OR ANY
OTHER DISCOMFORT—DISCONTINUE USE.
W CAMOMILE (MATRICARIA
ANFI-UKER CABBCMFE SOUP
HERE'S A BASIC CABBAGE SOUP THAFS CHOCKFULL OF ANTI-ULCER COMPOUNDS. YOU'LL HAVE
TO DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENTING TO ARRIVE AT A

THEY ARE DELICIOUS IN CABBAGE SOUP, THE
FLAVOR IS RATHER EXOTIC.

CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
RECUTITA). SEVERAL HERBALISTS I ADMIRE RECOMMEND CAMOMILE TEA FOR ULCERS, NOTABLY RUDOLF FRITZ WEISS, M.D., THE DEAN OF GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS AND AUTHOR OF HERBAL MEDICINE. HE WRITES THAT FOR STOMACH ULCERS, "THE REMEDY OF CHOICE
IS CAMOMILE THERE CAN BE NO OTHER REMEDY MORE TAILOR-MADE, INCLUDING ALL
SYNTHETIC PRODUCTS." WIDELY USED AS A DIGESTIVE AID IN EUROPE, CAMOMILE IS
UNIQUELY SUITED TO TREATING DIGESTIVE AILMENTS, INCLUDING ULCERS. THIS IS BECAUSE IT
COMBINES ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTISEPTIC, ANTISPASMODIC AND STOMACH-SOOTHING
PROPERTIES. IF I HAD AN ULCER, FD TAKE MY CAMOMILE TEA WITH LICORICE.
"W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC IS A POTENT, BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTIC.
PAUL BERGNER, EDITOR OF MEDICAL HERBALISM, SUGGESTS THAT THOSE WHO ARE WARY OF
PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIBIOTICS FOR ULCER TREATMENT MIGHT WANT TO TRY A COURSE OF GARLIC
THERAPY. THIS WOULD INVOLVE EATING NINE RAW CLOVES A DAY. YOU CAN CHOP THE GARLIC
AND MIX IT WITH ANY FOOD THAT MAKES IT PALATABLE, SUCH AS CARROT JUICE. TRY BLENDING
TWO RAW CLOVES OF GARLIC WITH ONE CARROT, FOR INSTANCE. I TRIED IT, AND THE COMBINATION TASTED BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD. IT'S A PAINLESS WAY TO TAKE A COUPLE OF
CLOVES OF GARLIC. YOU CAN ALSO TRY WHIPPING UP AN ANTI-ULCER GAZPACHO, HEAVY ON
THE GARLIC AND RED PEPPER.
VV GENTIAN (GENTIANA OFFICINALIS). THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL BITTER HERBS TRADITIONALLY USED TO AID DIGESTION. COMMISSION E REPORTS THAT THE BITTER COMPOUNDS
IN GENTIAN STIMULATE THE FLOW OF SALIVA AND STOMACH SECRETIONS.
STUDIES WITH EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS SUGGEST THAT GENTIAN MIGHT ALSO BE
USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF ULCERS. HERBAL PHARMACOLOGIST DANIEL MOWREY,
PH.D., AUTHOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE AND HERBAL TONTHERAPIES, WHOSE OPINIONS I RESPECT, RECOMMENDS USING GENTIAN ALONG WITH
GINGER, GOLDENSEAL AND LICORICE ROOT TO TREAT ULCERS.
VV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). LIKE CABBAGE, PINEAPPLE IS FAIRLY
WELL ENDOWED WITH GLUTAMINE, A COMPOUND WITH EXPERIMENTALLY VERIFIED ANTIULCER EFFECTS. PINEAPPLE ALSO CONTAINS BROMELAIN, A GENERAL DIGESTIVE AID.
V*. RED PEPPER (CAPSICUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). MANY AMERICANS BELIEVE
THAT HOT SPICES CAUSE ULCERS. THE TRUTH IS, THEY DON'T. IN FACT, THEY MAY EVEN PROTECT
THE STOMACH AND DUODENAL LINING AGAINST THEM. CAPSAICIN, THE COMPOUND THAT
GIVES RED PEPPER ITS HEAT, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PREVENT ULCERS IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS THAT WERE GIVEN HIGH, ULCER-CAUSING DOSES OF ASPIRIN.
V BILBERRY AND BLUEBERRY (VACCINIUM, VARIOUS SPECIES). BOTH OF
THESE FRUITS CONTAIN COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS ANTHOCYANOSIDES. IN STUDIES WITH EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS, THESE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO OFFER SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION AGAINST ULCERS. THEY HELP STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF MUCUS THAT PROTECTS
THE STOMACH LINING FROM DIGESTIVE ACIDS.
V MEADOWSWEET (FILIPENDULA ULMARIA). LIKE WILLOW BARK, MEAD440
VAGINITIS
OWSWEET IS A TYPE OF HERBAL ASPIRIN. ASPIRIN IN HIGH DOSES CAUSES ULCERS, SO IT
MIGHT SEEM STRANGE TO RECOMMEND IT AS AN ULCER TREATMENT. MANY PROMINENT
HERBALISTS DO, HOWEVER, AMONG THEM BRITISH HERBALIST DAVID HOFFMANN, AUTHOR OF
SEVERAL GOOD HERBALS, INCLUDING THE HERBAL HANDBOOK. THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN
MEADOWSWEET ARE SALICYLATES. ASPIRIN, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS NOTHING BUT SALICYLATES. HOFFMANN SAYS THAT WHILE PURE SALICYLATES DO INDEED CAUSE ULCERS, WHOLE
MEADOWSWEET HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT THEM DESPITE ITS SALICYLATE CONTENT.
OTHER CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN WHOLE MEADOWSWEET, AMONG THEM TANNINS,
PHENOLIC GLYCOSIDES AND THE HERB'S ESSENTIAL OIL, GIVE IT AN ANTI-ULCER EFFECT.
HOFFMANN UNFLINCHINGLY MAINTAINS THAT MEADOWSWEET IS ONE OF THE BEST DIGESTIVE HERBS AND RECOMMENDS IT FOR ULCERS AND HEARTBURN. THIS MAKES SENSE TO
ME. SEVERAL PLANTS WITH PROVEN ANTI-ULCER EFFECTS, INCLUDING CAMOMILE, ALSO
CONTAIN SALICYLATES.
V RHUBARB (RHEUM OFFICINALE). IN A CHINESE STUDY OF 312 PEOPLE WITH
BLEEDING ULCERS, RHUBARB HELPED IMPROVE SOME 90 PERCENT WITHIN A FEW DAYS. I'D
BE CAREFUL WHEN USING THIS HERB, AS IT'S ALSO A POWERFUL LAXATIVE. IF YOU EXPERIENCE
DIARRHEA, CUT BACK THE AMOUNT YOU'RE TAKING OR DISCONTINUE USE ALTOGETHER.
V TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). THIS CULINARY HERB, USED IN INDIAN AND
ASIAN CURRY DISHES, MIGHT BE CALLED THE POOR PERSON'S ULCER TREATMENT. IN A GOOD
STUDY BY PHYSICIANS IN THAILAND, TURMERIC (250-MILLIGRAM CAPSULES TAKEN THREE
TIMES A DAY) RELIEVED ULCER PAIN ONLY ABOUT HALF AS WELL AS PHARMACEUTICAL
ANTACIDS AFTER SIX WEEKS. HOWEVER, THE ANTACID WAS EIGHT TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE
THAN THE TURMERIC. IF YOU'RE LOW ON DOUGH, THIS HERB MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO GO.
U
P IN THE BACKWOODS OF MAINE LIVES AN HERBALIST WHOM I RESPECT AND
ADMIRE. DEB SOULE IS THE FOUNDER OF AVENA BOTANICALS AND AUTHOR OF
THE FEMINIST HERBAL THE ROOTS OF HEALING,
OVER THE YEARS, MANY WOMEN HAVE ASKED HER TO TREAT THEIR VAGINAL YEAST
INFECTIONS. SHE OFTEN RECOMMENDS CAREFULLY PEELING A CLOVE OF GARLIC SO THAT IT
DOES NOT SUFFER ANY NICKS AND THEN WRAPPING IT IN CLEAN GAUZE WITH A CLEAN, UNBLEACHED STRING ATTACHED, THUS CREATING A SMALL, TAMPONLIKE PACKET. SHE SAYS TO
INSERT A FRESHLY PREPARED PACKET INTO THE VAGINA EACH NIGHT FOR UP TO SIX CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS. IN MANY CASES, SHE SAYS, THIS TREATMENT CURES THE INFECTION.
I'M NOT SURPRISED, AS GARLIC HAS POTENT ANTIFUNGAL PROPERTIES.
441
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
BY SOME ESTIMATES, VAGINITIS, WHICH IS ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE MUCOSAL
LINING OF THE VAGINA, ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HALF OF ALL GYNECOLOGICAL VISITS. THERE
ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CAUSES OF VAGINITIS, BUT YEAST INFECTIONS ARE THE MOST
COMMON. (FOR MORE INFORMATION ON YEAST INFECTIONS, SEE PAGE 461.)
UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO, THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR VAGINITIS WAS A
PRESCRIPTION ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION. WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS, MANY OF THOSE
MEDICATIONS HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER, ALLOWING WOMEN TO TREAT
THEMSELVES IF THEY KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH A YEAST INFECTION.
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO POINT OUT THAT DOCTORS DO NOT RECOMMEND SELF-TREATMENT FOR VAGINITIS UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. IF YOU'VE
BEEN DIAGNOSED IN THE PAST AND HAVE A PRETTY GOOD SUSPICION AS TO THE CAUSE,
YOU CAN GIVE SELF-TREATMENT A TRY. BUT IF THE SYMPTOMS DON'T CLEAR UP WITHIN A
FEW DAYS, OR IF YOU EXPERIENCE RECURRING BOUTS OF VAGINITIS, YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR
DOCTOR.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR VAGINITIS
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS THAT CAN HELP TREAT VAGINITIS.
V \ V GARLIC {ALLIUM SATIVUM). IF INSERTING A GAUZE-WRAPPED GARLIC CLOVE
DOES NOT APPEAL TO YOU AS A VAGINITIS TREATMENT, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IT
MIGHT NOT, TRY ADDING A TEASPOON OF FRESH GARLIC JUICE TO A FEW TABLESPOONS OF YOGURT, THEN EITHER SOAK A TAMPON IN IT OR USE IT AS A DOUCHE TWICE A DAY WHILE SYMPTOMS PERSIST. THIS TREATMENT MAY NOT WIN ANY AWARDS IN THE ODOR DEPARTMENT, BUT
IT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.
THERE'S A GREAT BOOK OUT CALLED GARLIC: THE SCIENCE AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND RELATED SPECIES BY HEINRICH P. KOCH, PH.D., PROFESSOR OF PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY AND BIOPHAIMACEUTICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIENNA, AND LARRY D. LAWSON, PH.D., A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT AN HERB COMPANY IN
UTAH. DR. KOCH AND DR. LAWSON PRAISE THE "EXTRAORDINARY FUNGICIDAL ACTIVITY OF
FRESH-PRESSED GARLIC JUICE AND DRIED GARLIC."AND THEY IDENTIFY ALLICIN AS THE MAJOR
COMPOUND IN GARLIC THAT KILLS CANDIDA ALBICANS, THE FUNGUS THAT CAUSES VAGINAL
YEAST INFECTIONS.
V W TEATREE (MELALEUCA, VARIOUS SPECIES). AUSTRALIAN TEATREE OIL HAS BECOME PROMINENT ONLY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AS AN ANTISEPTIC, BUT AS WORD OF ITS
CONSIDERABLE HEALING POWER HAS SPREAD, ANNUAL PRODUCTION IN AUSTRALIA HAS INCREASED FROM 20 TONS OF OIL TO MORE THAN 140.
AUSTRALIAN CHEMISTS HAVE SHOWN THAT TEATREE OIL IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
AGAINST CANDIDA. ONE COMPOUND IN THE OIL, TERPINEN-4-OL, APPEARS TO BE THE KEY TO
442
VAGINITIS
THIS HERB'S ANTI-CANDIDA ACTION. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CREAMS AND DOUCHES
CONTAINING HIGH AMOUNTS OF THIS COMPOUND HAVE BEEN AS EFFECTIVE AGAINST YEAST
INFECTIONS AS THE PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIFUNGALS NYSTATIN (MYCOSTATIN) AND CLOTRIMAZOLE (GYNE-LOTRIMIN).
FOR RECURRENT YEAST INFECTIONS, SOULE SUGGESTS MIXING TWO TO THREE DROPS OF
TEATREE OIL IN A TABLESPOON OF YOGURT AND THEN SOAKING A TAMPON IN IT. INSERT THE
TAMPON AT NIGHT FOR UP TO SIX NIGHTS. JUST DON'T TAKE TEATREE OIL, OR ANY ESSENTIAL
OIL, INTERNALLY. THEY ARE EXTREMELY CONCENTRATED, AND EVEN SMALL QUANTITIES OF
MANY OF THEM CAN BE POISONOUS.
V*, CARDAMOM (ELETTARIA CARDAMOMUM). CARDAMOM MAY HAVE TWICE
AS MUCH TERPINEN-4-OL AS TEATREE. YOU CAN FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN FOR TEATREE
OIL, BUT INSTEAD USE TWO TO THREE DROPS OF CARDAMOM OIL.
VV GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS). GOLDENSEAL IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM
HERBAL ANTIBIOTIC, THANKS TO TWO CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, BERBERINE AND HYDRASTINE,
THAT IT CONTAINS. SEVERAL STUDIES SHOW THAT THESE COMPOUNDS HELP TREAT TRICHOMONAL VAGINITIS, A TYPE THAT IS CAUSED BY AN AMOEBA.
GOLDENSEAL ALSO HAS SOME IMMUNE-STIMULATING ACTIVITY. I OFTEN COMBINE IT
WITH ECHINACEA, WHICH IS IMMUNE-STIMULATING AND ANTIBIOTIC. BOTH OF THESE HERBS
ARE TAKEN ORALLY IN THE FORM OF TEAS, TINCTURES OR CAPSULES.
V COMFREY (SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE). MOST CASES OF VAGINITIS ARE CAUSED
BY INFECTION, BUT SOMETIMES, PARTICULARLY IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, VAGINAL DRYNESS CAN LEAD TO IRRITATION AND INFLAMMATION DURING OR AFTER INTERCOURSE. MY FRIEND
JEANNE ROSE, CALIFORNIA HERBALIST AND AUTHOR OF SEVERAL GOOD HERB BOOKS, RECOMMENDS APPLYING A MOISTURIZING LOTION OR EGG WHITE MIXED WITH THE CONTENTS OF A
VITAMIN E CAPSULE AND A COUPLE OF DROPS OF COMFREY TINCTURE JUST PRIOR TO INTERCOURSE.
V LAVENDER (LAVANDULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). ROSE SUGGESTS ESSENTIAL
OILS, NOTABLY LAVENDER, FOR TREATMENT OF TRICHOMONAS AND GARDNERELLA VAGINITIS.
SHE RECOMMENDS ADDING A FEW DROPS TO DOUCHES, SITZ BATHS, CREAMS, LOTIONS AND
TAMPONS. (REMEMBER THAT ESSENTIAL OILS ARE FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY.) IN ADDITION TO
LAVENDER, SHE IS PARTIAL TO TEATREE OIL AND OCCASIONALLY CLARY SAGE AND GERMAN
CAMOMILE.
SHE WISELY CAUTIONS AGAINST ROUTINE DOUCHING; YOU SHOULD DOUCHE ONLY FOR
TREATMENT OF VAGINITIS. REGULAR DOUCHING CAN KILL OFF BENEFICIAL MICROORGANISMS
AND LEAVE YOU OPEN FOR INVASION BY THE INFECTION-CAUSING VARIETY. IN FACT, STUDIES
SHOW THAT WOMEN WHO DOUCHE REGULARLY ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE.
443
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
V YELLOWDOCK (RUMEX CRISPUS). ROSE OFTEN RECOMMENDS USING A COMBINATION OF YELLOWDOCK AND OTHER HERBS FOR MOST TYPES OF
VAGINITIS. HER FORMULA INCLUDES ONE OUNCE OF YELLOWDOCK ROOT,
TWO OUNCES OF ECHINACEA ROOT, ONE OUNCE OF GOLDENSEAL ROOT
AND ONE OUNCE OF GINSENG ROOT AS A TONIC FOR OVERALL HEALTH.
YOU CAN USE A MIXTURE OF DRIED HERBS IN THE LISTED
PROPORTIONS TO MAKE A TEA. YOU COULD ALSO PULVERIZE
THEM AND INSERT THE MIXTURE INTO EMPTY GELATIN CAPSULES, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE AT MANY NATURAL FOOD
STORES THAT SELL HERBS. ADMITTEDLY, THIS IS
A LOT OF WORK, BUT WOMEN WHO FACE RECURRENT VAGINITIS ARE WILLING TO MAKE THE
EXTRA EFFORT IF THEY FIND THAT THE TREATMENT
WORKS FOR THEM. YOU CAN TRY TAKING TWO
OR THREE CAPSULES A DAY.
V APPLE CIDER VINEGAR. HERE'S
AN OLD FOLK REMEDY, WHICH MANY PHYSICIANS ALSO RECOMMEND, FOR SEVERAL TYPES
OF VAGINITIS: ADD THREE CUPS OF APPLE
CIDER VINEGAR TO A HOT BATH AND SOAK IN
THE TUB FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES,
SPREADING YOUR LEGS TO ALLOW WATER TO
FLOW INTO THE VAGINA. ROSE SUGGESTS THAT
VINEGAR BATHS AND DOUCHES HELP RESTORE
NORMAL VAGINAL ACIDITY. NORMAL ACIDITY
HELPS BANISH CANDIDA, TRICHOMONAS AND
GARDNERELLA.
ALSO KNOWN AS CURLY DOCK, THIS HERB
HAS DEEP ROOTS THAT ARE SPLIT AND
DRIED FOR USE IN TONICS AND OINTMENTS
444
\KRICOSE \FEINS
I
GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO STEP INTO CONTROVERSIES, BUT HERE'S ONE FOR YOU: I
THINK THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THAT EATING VIOLET FLOWERS MIGHT HELP TREAT
VARICOSE VEINS.
THIS MAY SOUND FAR-FETCHED. NONE OF THE RECENT SPATE OF "FOOD PHARMACY"
BOOKS MENTIONS VIOLETS FOR THIS COMMON PROBLEM. BUT I HAVE SOME INTRIGUING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MY CLAIM THAT VIOLETS MIGHT PREVENT AND TREAT SOME VARICOSE
VEINS AND SPIDER VEINS. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT, IT'S NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CAUSES OF THESE PROBLEMS.
VARICOSE VEINS OCCUR WHEN THE VALVES IN THE VEINS THAT PREVENT BLOOD FROM
FLOWING BACKWARD DON'T WORK PROPERLY. BLOOD FORMS POOLS, AND WHERE THIS OCCURS,
THE VEINS AND NEARBY CAPILLARIES BECOME DISTENDED AND SWOLLEN, LEAKING BLOOD
AND FLUID INTO SURROUNDING TISSUE. THIS CONDITION OCCURS MOST FREQUENTLY IN THE
LEGS; IN AREAS WHERE VEINS ARE NEAR THE SURFACE, IT CAUSES UNSIGHTLY BLUISH STREAKS,
TRAILS OR SPIDERY MARKINGS. BUT THIS CONDITION CAN DEVELOP ELSEWHERE AS WELL.
WHEN THEY OCCUR IN AND AROUND THE ANUS, THESE PROBLEM VEINS (VARICOSITIES) ARE
KNOWN AS HEMORRHOIDS. WHEN THEY OCCUR IN THE SCROTUM, THEY ARE KNOWN AS
VARICOCELES.
VARICOSE VEINS AFFECT ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN, AND
THE TENDENCY TO HAVE THIS CONDITION SEEMS TO RUN IN FAMILIES. WHEN THEY OCCUR
IN THE LEGS, VARICOSE VEINS ARE MOST COMMON ON THE CALVES AND ALONG THE INNER
THIGHS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR VARICOSE VEINS
A NUMBER OF HERBS, INCLUDING VIOLETS, CAN HELP PREVENT OR TREAT THIS
PROBLEM.
VV%, HORSE CHESTNUT (AESCTDUS HIPPOCASTANUM). IN TRADITIONAL HERBAL
MEDICINE, HORSE CHESTNUT SEEDS WERE USED TO TREAT VARICOSE VEINS AND HEMORRHOIDS. EVENTUALLY, BOTANISTS ISOLATED THE MOST ACTIVE COMPOUND, AESCIN, AND EXPERIMENTS WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS SUPPORTED ITS TRADITIONAL USE AS A REMEDY.
AESCIN HELPS STRENGTHEN CAPILLARY CELLS AND REDUCE FLUID LEAKAGE.
COMMISSION E, THE COMMITTEE OF SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE
GERMAN COUNTERPART OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ENDORSES HORSE
CHESTNUT FOR TREATING VARICOSE VEINS. ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC, VARRO TYLER,
PH.D., DEAN AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF PHARMACOGNOSY (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACY) AT PURDUE UNIVERSITY IN WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA, IS ALSO AN ADVOCATE. IN
445
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
HIS EXCELLENT BOOK FOR CLINICIANS, HERBS OF CHOICE, HE SINGLES OUT HORSE CHESTNUT
SEED AS BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE PLANT DRUG FOR TREATING VARICOSE VEINS.
IN EUROPE, HORSE CHESTNUT PREPARATIONS ARE MARKETED AS EXTRACTS OF THE
LEAVES, BARK AND/OR SEEDS, WHICH ARE TAKEN ORALLY.
LIKE MOST EUROPEAN PLANT MEDICINES,
HORSE CHESTNUT EXTRACTS ARE STANDARDIZED, AND THE DOSAGE SHOULD BE ON
THE LABEL. UNFORTUNATELY, THESE
STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS ARE
NOT YET WIDELY AVAILABLE IN
THE UNITED STATES.
YOU MUST OBTAIN A
STANDARDIZED EXTRACT AND
FOLLOW PACKAGE DIRECTIONS
IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE
HORSE CHESTNUT AS A
HEALING HERB. IT'S SIMPLY
NOT SAFE TO USE OTHERWISE.
IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE EXTRACT, YOU'LL HAVE TO RELY
ON OTHER HERBS MENTIONED
IN THIS CHAPTER.
V \ V VIOLET (VIOLA,
VARIOUS SPECIES). VIOLET
FLOWERS CONTAIN GENEROUS
AMOUNTS OF A COMPOUND
CALLED RUTIN, WHICH HELPS
MAINTAIN THE STRENGTH AND INTEGRITY OF CAPILLARY WALLS. MEDICAL TEXTS SAY THAT TAKING
20 TO 100 MILLIGRAMS OF RUTIN DAILY CAN SIGNIFICANDY STRENGTHEN THE CAPILLARIES.
ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE AND SOME CALCULATIONS, I ESTIMATE THAT A HALFCUP OF FRESH VIOLET FLOWERS WOULD CONTAIN ANYWHERE FROM 200 TO 2,300 MILLIGRAMS OF RUTIN. YOU'D PROBABLY NEED ONLY A FEW TABLESPOONS TO GET 100
MILLIGRAMS.
ARE VIOLETS SAFE TO EAT? YES. I'VE EATEN 100 OR SO VIOLET FLOWERS ON SEVERAL
DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AND I'VE NEVER SUFFERED ANY ILL EFFECTS. BOTH VIOLETS AND
PANSIES, WHICH ALSO CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RUTIN, ARE USUALLY CITED IN
THE BOOKS ABOUT EDIBLE FLOWERS. AS FAR AS I CAN DETERMINE, THEY ARE SAFE WHEN
CONSUMED AT THESE LOW LEVELS, AND BOTH FLOWERS MAKE IMPRESSIVE ADDITIONS TO
SALADS.
HORSE CHESTNUT
THE LEAVES, BARK AND SEEDS OF HORSE CHESTNUT ARE
MADE INTO STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS, WIDELY AVAILABLE IN
EUROPE, THAT CAN HELP TREAT VARICOSE VEINS.
446
VARICOSE VEIN S
IF YOU'D RATHER NOT MUNCH ON FLOWERS, YOU MIGHT TRY BUCKWHEAT, WHICH IS
ALSO HIGH IN RUTIN. A HALF-CUP SERVING COULD CONTAIN ABOUT 6,000 MILLIGRAMS OF
RUTIN, MUCH MORE THAN NECESSARY TO CURB CAPILLARY FRAGILITY. EATING A PLATE OF
BUCKWHEAT PANCAKES STRIKES ME AS A PARTICULARLY NICE WAY TO TAKE MEDICINE.
YOU MIGHT ALSO INVESTIGATE KASHA, A CEREAL-LIKE PRODUCT MADE FROM BUCKWHEAT
GROATS. PACKAGED KASHA IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IN SUPERMARKETS.
^ V \ WITCH HAZEL (HAMAMELU VIRGINIANA). WITCH HAZEL COMES IN TWO
COMMERCIAL PREPARATIONS, WATER EXTRACTS (WITCH HAZEL WATER) AND ALCOHOL EXTRACTS
(TINCTURE OF WITCH HAZEL). BOTH ARE SOOTHINGLY ASTRINGENT, WHICH MAKES WITCH HAZEL
A POPULAR EXTERNAL HERBAL TREATMENT FOR VARIOUS SKIN CONDITIONS FROM BRUISES TO
VARICOSE VEINS.
STUDIES WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS HERB HELPS
STRENGTHEN BLOOD VESSELS. COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING WITCH HAZEL EXTRACTS
EXTERNALLY TO TREAT BOTH HEMORRHOIDS AND VARICOSE VEINS. SIMPLY WIPE THE AFFECTED AREA WITH A COTTON BALL THAT HAS BEEN DIPPED IN THE EXTRACT.
TINCTURE OF WITCH HAZEL CAN BE TAKEN INTERNALLY FOR VARICOSE VEINS, SAYS THE
LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER. OR TO MAKE A TEA,
STEEP ONE TO TWO TEASPOONS OF DRIED WITCH HAZEL LEAVES IN A CUP OF BOILING WATER
FOR TEN MINUTES. YOU CAN DRINK TWO TO THREE CUPS A DAY.
VV BUTCHER'S BROOM (RUSCUS ACULEATIIS). THIS HERB HAS A LONG HISTORY
OF TREATING VENOUS PROBLEMS LIKE HEMORRHOIDS AND VARICOSE VEINS. IT CONTAINS TWO
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOUNDS, RUSCOGENIN AND NEORUSCOGENIN, THAT CONSTRICT AND
STRENGTHEN VEINS.
VV LEMON {CITRUS UNION). LEMON PEEL HELPS RELIEVE VARICOSE VEINS. IT
CONTAINS SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS FLAVONOIDS, INCLUDING RUTIN, THAT REDUCE THE PERMEABILITY OF THE BLOOD VESSELS, ESPECIALLY THE CAPILLARIES. I ALMOST ALWAYS ADD CITRUS
PEEL TO MY FRUIT JUICES WHEN I'M BLENDING UP A BATCH. IT'S WORTH A TRY.
W ONION (ALLIUM CEPA). ONION SKIN IS ONE OF OUR BEST SOURCES OF THE COMPOUND QUERCETIN. LIKE RUTIN, QUERCETIN REPORTEDLY DECREASES CAPILLARY FRAGILITY. TO
GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE QUERCETIN, YOU SHOULD COOK WITH WHOLE, UNPEELED ONIONS
WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND DISCARD THE SKIN BEFORE SERVING.
V BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTULUS), BILBERRY HELPS CIRCULATION BY STIMULATING NEW CAPILLARY FORMATION, STRENGTHENING CAPILLARY WALLS AND INCREASING THE
OVERALL HEALTH OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH CAPSULES ARE AVAILABLE, I PREFER
WHOLE BILBERRIES WHENEVER THEY ARE AVAILABLE. RELATED BERRIES, WHICH HAVE THE
SAME BENEFITS, INCLUDE BLACKBERRIES AND BLUEBERRIES.
V GINKGO (GINKGO BILOBA). GINKGO IS AN ALL-AROUND CIRCULATION BOOSTER.
IT'S MOST WIDELY KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW THROUGH THE BRAIN, BUT
IT ALSO IMPROVES CIRCULATION ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY. GERMAN PHYSICIANS USE GINKGO
447
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
PREPARATIONS FOR TREATING VARICOSE VEINS. HOWEVER, LARGE ORAL DOSES MAY BE REQUIRED, AND THAT MIGHT PROVE EXPENSIVE.
TO USE THIS HERB, YOU NEED TO BUY A 50:1 EXTRACT, WHICH WILL BE SPECIFIED
ON THE LABEL. NO TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS HAVE EVER BEEN REPORTED FROM USING THESE
STANDARDIZED LEAF EXTRACTS, ALTHOUGH AMOUNTS HIGHER THAN 240 MILLIGRAMS DAILY
MAY CAUSE DIARRHEA, IRRITABILITY AND RESTLESSNESS.
V GOTU KOLA (CENTELLA ASIATIC A). SEVERAL STUDIES SHOW THAT EXTRACTS OF
THIS ASIAN HERB ARE USEFUL IN TREATING CIRCULATORY PROBLEMS IN THE LOWER LIMBS, INCLUDING VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY, WATER RETENTION IN THE ANKLES, FOOT SWELLING AND VARICOSE VEINS. THE PLANT HAS THREE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS, ASIATIC ACID, ASIATICOSIDE AND
MADECASSIC ACID, THAT APPEAR TO WORK TOGETHER. ALTHOUGH GOTU KOLA IS AVAILABLE IN
CAPSULES, AND IT'S FINE TO TAKE IT THIS WAY, I PREFER TO ADD THE DICED FRESH LEAVES TO
JUICES AND SALADS.
V SPANISH PEANUT (ARACHIS HYPOGAEA). THE HEALING AGENT HERE IS NOT
THE GOOBERS THEMSELVES BUT RATHER THEIR REDDISH, PAPERY SKINS. PEANUT SKINS ARE
ONE OF THE BETTER DIETARY SOURCES OF OLIGOMERIC PROCYANIDINS (OPCS), WHICH ARE
COMPOUNDS THAT DECREASE CAPILLARY FRAGILITY AND PERMEABILITY, THUS HELPING TO PREVENT AND TREAT VARICOSE VEINS.
PYCNOGENOL, A MAJOR SOURCE OF OPCS, IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED
STATES AS A RATHER EXPENSIVE SUPPLEMENT, AND IF ANYTHING, IT IS OVERPROMOTED.
SINCE IT OCCURS NATURALLY IN MOST FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, I PREFER TO GET MY OPCS
FROM FOOD. MUNCHING A FEW HANDFULS OF SPANISH PEANUTS—SKINS AND ALL—IS A
PARTICULARLY NICE WAY TO GET A DAILY DOSE OF OPCS.
V ASSORTED ESSENTIAL OILS. AROMATHERAPISTS SUGGEST MASSAGING THE AFFECTED AREA WITH THE ESSENTIAL OILS OF CYPRESS, JUNIPER, LAVENDER, LEMON AND MARJORAM. THE OILS SHOULD BE DILUTED BEFORE THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE SKIN, SO
ADD A FEW DROPS OF THE OILS OF YOUR CHOICE TO A COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS OF ANY VEGETABLE OIL. THIS MASSAGE TREATMENT CAN'T HURT, AND IT MIGHT HELP. JUST DON'T INGEST
ESSENTIAL OILS, AS EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT CAN BE TOXIC.
VIRAL INIECTIONS
V
IRUSES ARE VERY STRANGE. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SMALL—SO TINY THAT WHILE
ORDINARY MICROSCOPES CAN SEE THE BODY'S CELLS AND THE BACTERIA THAT
MAY INFECT THEM, YOU NEED MUCH MORE POWERFUL ELECTRON MICROSCOPES TO SEE
VIRUS PARTICLES.
448
VIRA L INFECTION S
I USE THE WORD PARTICLE BECAUSE BY MOST DEFINITIONS OF LIFE, VIRUSES AREN'T
REALLY ALIVE. THEY CONTAIN ONLY GENETIC MATERIAL (DNA OR RNA) SURROUNDED BY
A PROTEIN CAPSULE. VIRUSES DON'T INGEST FOOD, BREATHE OXYGEN OR ELIMINATE
WASTES. ALL THEY DO IS REPRODUCE AFTER THEY'VE INFECTED CELLS THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THEM.
ANTIBIOTICS ARE GENERALLY USELESS AGAINST VIRUSES; THEY WORK MOST ACTIVELY
AGAINST BACTERIA. SINCE THE DISCOVERY OF PENICILLIN IN 1928, MAINSTREAM MEDICINE HAS COME UP WITH DOZENS OF ANTIBIOTICS. BUT TODAY WE STILL HAVE ONLY A
HANDFUL OF ANTIVIRAL DRUGS, AMONG THEM ACYCLOVIR FOR HERPES, AZT FOR AIDS AND
INTERFERON, THE BODY'S OWN VIRUS FIGHTER.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR VIRAL INFECTIONS
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SEVERAL HERBS USED IN TRADITIONAL HERBAL MEDICINE
HAVE SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED ANTIVIRAL EFFECTS. THEY'RE WHAT I USE WHEN I
HAVE COLDS, FLU AND OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS. I DISCUSS MANY OF THESE HERBS IN THE
CHAPTER ON COLDS AND FLU (SEE PAGE 133), BUT I WANT TO DEVOTE ONE CHAPTER TO A
LOOK AT HERBS THAT CAN BE TRIED AS A TREATMENT FOR ANY VIRAL INFECTION.
V V \ ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA^ VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS IS BY FAR
THE MOST POPULAR ANTIVIRAL HERB, AND FOR GOOD REASON. ECHINACEA J ^
FIGHTS VIRUSES IN TWO WAYS. IT CONTAINS THREE COMPOUNDS WITH SPECIFIC ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY—CAFFEIC ACID,
CHICORIC ACID AND ECHINACIN. ROOT EXTRACTS OF
ECHINACEA HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO ACT LIKE INTERFERON, THE BODY'S OWN ANTIVIRAL COMPOUND. IN
ADDITION, ECHINACEA IS AN IMMUNE STIMULANT THAT
HELPS THE BODY DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST VIRAL INFECTION
MORE EFFECTIVELY.
HERBALISTS ARE QUICK TO TOUT ECHINACEA AS
AN IMMUNE BOOSTER, BUT THE FACT IS, SCIENTISTS
STILL DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT STIMULATES THE
IMMUNE SYSTEM. SOME SUGGEST THAT IT INCREASES
THE BODY'S LEVELS OF A COMPOUND KNOWN AS PROPERDIN, WHICH ACTIVATES THE SPECIFIC PART OF THE
IMMUNE SYSTEM, CALLED THE COMPLEMENTARY
PATHWAY, THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING DISEASE-FIGHTING WHITE BLOOD CELLS INTO INFECTED
AREAS TO BATTLE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA.
OTHER RESEARCHERS MAINTAIN THAT OTHER COMPOUNDS IN THE HERB, LIPOPHILIC AMIDES AND POLAR
ECHINACEA
ECHINACEA, THE PLAINS INDIANS'
PRIMARY MEDICINE, TODAY IS THE
WORLD'S BEST-RECOGNIZED HERBAL
IMMUNITY BOOSTER.
4 4 9
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
CAFFEIC ACID DERIVATIVES, ARE AT THE ROOT OF ITS IMMUNOSTIMULANT ACTIVITY. ONE
COMPOUND, CHICORIC ACID, INHIBITS INTEGRASE, AN ENZYME THAT'S IMPORTANT IN
VIRAL REPRODUCTION.
I'M GENERALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY ALL THE COMPOUNDS IN A PLANT HAVE A
WAY OF WORKING TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY, SO I'M INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OF
THESE IMMUNE-BOOSTING PROPERTIES WORK TOGETHER.
COMMISSION E, THE GERMAN EXPERT COMMITTEE THAT JUDGES THE VALUE OF
HERBAL MEDICINES FOR THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT, HAS APPROVED ECHINACEA FOR
TREATMENT OF INFLUENZA-LIKE SYMPTOMS. THAT CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC
ENDORSEMENT OF THIS HERB, WHICH IS NATIVE TO AMERICA.
VV ASTRAGALUS (ASTRAGALUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). ALSO KNOWN AS HUANG <JRI,
THIS IS AN IMMUNE-BOOSTING HERB FROM CHINA. IN ONE SMALL CHINESE STUDY, TEN
PEOPLE WHOSE HEART MUSCLES WERE INFECTED BY COXSACKIE B VIRUS, WHICH CAUSES THE
HEART INFLAMMATION KNOWN AS MYOCARDITIS, RECEIVED INJECTIONS OF ASTRAGALUS EXTRACT FOR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. THE ACTIVITY OF THEIR NATURAL KILLER CELLS, A COMPONENT OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, ROSE 11 TO 45 PERCENT. THEY ALSO SHOWED INCREASED
LEVELS OF ALPHA- AND GAMMA-INTERFERON, THE BODY'S OWN ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS. NOT
SURPRISINGLY, THEIR SYMPTOMS IMPROVED. EUROPEAN STUDIES SUGGEST THAT, AS WITH
ECHINACEA, MANY OF THE IMMUNE-STIMULATING COMPOUNDS IN ASTRAGALUS ARE ACTIVE
WHEN TAKEN ORALLY.
^V DRAGON'S BLOOD (CROTON LECHLERI). THIS HERB IS ALSO KNOWN AS SANGREGRADO OR SANGRE DE DRAGO. THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY DRAGON'S BLOOD IS ON THE
BACK COVER OF THE AMAZONIAN ETHNOBOTANICAL DICTIONARY, WHICH I CO-AUTHORED IN
1994 WITH RODOLFO VASQUEZ, BOTANIST AT THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN. SEVERAL
COMPOUNDS IN IT, AMONG THEM DIMETHYLCEDRUSINE AND TASPINE, HAVE ANTIVIRAL AND
WOUND-HEALING PROPERTIES THAT MAY BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL AGAINST THE VIRAL SORES
CAUSED BY HERPES. THE NATURAL MIXTURE OF ALL THREE COMPOUNDS HEALS WOUNDS FOUR
TIMES FASTER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL COMPOUNDS ALONE.
I USE DRAGON'S BLOOD WHEN I GET CUTS OR ABRASIONS IN TROPICAL PERU. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS HERB IS NOT YET WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH I
EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE SOON. IT IS APPLIED EXTERNALLY.
VV GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). IN ADDITION TO ITS WELL-KNOWN ANTIBACTERIAL
ACTION, GARLIC IS ALSO ANTIVIRAL. SEVERAL OF THE SULFUR COMPOUNDS IN GARLIC ARE ACTIVE AGAINST THE FLU VIRUS, ACCORDING TO HEINRICH P. KOCH, PH.D., PROFESSOR OF PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, AND
LARRY D. LAWSON, PH.D., A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT AN HERB COMPANY IN UTAH, AUTHORS
OF GARLIC: THE SCIENCE AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND RELATED
SPECIES.
AGAIN, I'M RELUCTANT TO POINT TO ANY SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS IN GARLIC, BECAUSE
450
VIRA L INFECTION S
I SUSPECT THAT THEY ALL SOMEHOW WORK TOGETHER.
SOME PHYSICIANS WHO USE HERBS RECOMMEND TAKING TWO GARLIC CAPSULES A
DAY TO TREAT COLDS, FLU AND OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS. BUT I PREFER FRESH GARLIC TO CAPSULES, AND SO DOES NATUROPATH JANE GUILTINAN, N.D., CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF
BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN SEATTLE. SHE RECOMMENDS CONSUMING UP TO A DOZEN CLOVES
A DAY. I'D HAVE TROUBLE WITH TAKING THAT MANY, EXCEPT IN SALAD DRESSING, GARLIC
BREAD, SOUPS AND VEGETABLE JUICE.
TO AVOID COLDS, I'D SUGGEST YOU GO AHEAD AND EAT A LOT OF GARLIC AS A PREVENTIVE. THE OTHER FOOD TO FAVOR IS ONION, A CLOSE RELATIVE OF GARLIC, WHICH HAS
SIMILAR THOUGH LESS POTENT ANTIVIRAL ACTION.
V%, GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS)* LIKE ECHINACEA, GOLDENSEAL IS
AN IMMUNE STIMULANT, THANKS TO THE BERBERINE IT CONTAINS. I OFTEN USE IT IN COMBINATION WITH ECHINACEA.
VV JUNIPER (JUNIPERUS, VARIOUS SPECIES). EVEN AMONG HERBALISTS, IT'S
NOT WIDELY KNOWN THAT JUNIPER CONTAINS A POTENT ANTIVIRAL COMPOUND (DEOXYPODOPHYLLOTOXIN). JUNIPER EXTRACTS APPEAR TO INHIBIT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VIRUSES,
INCLUDING THOSE THAT CAUSE FLU AND HERPES. SOMETIMES WHEN I FEEL A COLD COMING
ON, I MAKE A JUNIPER TEA.
VV LEMON BALM (MELISSA OFFICINALIS). ALSO KNOWN AS MELISSA, THIS HERB
IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS AN ANTIVIRAL, ESPECIALLY AGAINST HERPES. I WOULD TRY
LEMON BALM FOR TREATING ANY VIRAL INFECTION. IT MAKES A VERY PLEASANT TEA.
VV LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA). AMONG ITS MANY OTHER MEDICINAL
USES, LICORICE IS ACTIVE AGAINST MANY TYPES OF VIRAL INFECTIONS. ONE OF ITS EIGHT ACTIVE ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS, GLYCYRRHIZIN, INHIBITS A NUMBER OF PROCESSES INVOLVED
IN VIRUS REPHCATION, AMONG THEM PENETRATION OF THE BODY'S CELLS AND REPHCATION OF
VIRAL GENETIC MATERIAL.
YOU COULD TRY A TEA MADE BY ADDING A FEW TEASPOONS OF CHOPPED DRIED ROOT
PER CUP OF BOILING WATER; STEEP FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
VV SHIITAKE (LENTINUS EDODES). THIS TASTY ASIAN MUSHROOM CONTAINS A
COMPOUND CALLED LENTINAN THAT HAS ANTIVIRAL, IMMUNE-STIMULATING AND ANTI-TUMOR
PROPERTIES, ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED IN THE LAWRENCE REVIEW OF NATURAL
PRODUCTS, A RESPECTED NEWSLETTER. ITS ANTIVIRAL ACTION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN EXPERIMENTS WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS. SHIITAKE EXTRACT HELPED PROTECT MICE AGAINST
VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS.
SHIITAKE CAPSULES ARE AVAILABLE, BUT I PERSONALLY PREFER TO USE THE WHOLE
MUSHROOM AS FOOD.
V EUCALYPTUS (EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS.) SEVERAL COMPOUNDS IN EUCALYPTUS, HYPEROSIDE, QUERCITRIN AND TANNIC ACID, HAVE VIRUS-KILLING PROPERTIES, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D.
451
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
V FORSYTHIA (FORSYTHIA SUSPENSA) AND HONEYSUCKLE (LONICERA
JAPONICA). WHENEVER I FEEL A COLD OR FLU COMING ON, I MIX UP A REVERED CHINESE
TEA COMBO WITH HONEYSUCKLE AND FORSYTHIA. SOMETIMES I ADD A LITTLE ANTIVIRAL
LEMON BALM. LIKE LEMON BALM, HONEYSUCKLE AND FORSYTHIA CONTAIN COMPOUNDS THAT
ARE PROVEN VIRUS KILLERS. I FIND THE COMBINATION OF HONEYSUCKLE, FORSYTHIA AND
LEMON BALM ESPECIALLY NICE IN HOT TEA JUST BEFORE BED.
V GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). GOOD OLD GINGER IS GOOD FOR MORE THAN
JUST MOTION SICKNESS AND UPSET STOMACH. ACCORDING TO MY DATABASE, IT CONTAINS
TEN ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS. SO IF YOU HAVE A VIRAL ILLNESS, YOU COULD TRY SOME GINGER
TEA OR ADD GINGER LIBERALLY TO DISHES YOU COOK. MANY OF THE ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS
IN GINGER ALSO APPEAR IN TURMERIC.
WARTS
T
HE COMMON WART IS VERY COMMON INDEED. BUT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS AS IF
FOLK TREATMENTS FOR WARTS ARE EVEN MORE COMMON. THERE'S GOOD REASON
FOR THIS: NOT ONLY DO MANY FOLK TREATMENTS WORK, THEY OFTEN MAKE PHYSICIANS'
TREATMENTS LOOK CLUMSY BY COMPARISON.
WARTS ARE BENIGN SKIN TUMORS THAT ARE CAUSED BY AT LEAST 35 DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF ONE FAMILY OF VIRUSES CALLED PAPILLOMAVIRUS. THE COMMON WART TYPICALLY
APPEARS ON THE HAND, ESPECIALLY IN OLDER CHILDREN, BUT WARTS CAN OCCUR ON OTHER
PARTS OF THE BODY AS WELL. (PLANTAR WARTS ARE THE KIND THAT SHOW UP ONLY ON THE
FEET.) RESEARCHERS HAVE OBSERVED THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH SUPPRESSED IMMUNE
SYSTEMS ARE FAR MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO WARTS THAN THOSE WITH NORMAL IMMUNITY.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR WARTS
HERE ARE THE HERBS YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE FIGHTING THIS ANNOYINGLY PERSISTENT PROBLEM.
V W BIRCH (BETULA, VARIOUS SPECIES). BIRCH BARK HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT
WARTS IN PLACES AS DIVERSE AS CHINA, SCANDINAVIA AND MICHIGAN. IT CONTAINS TWO
COMPOUNDS, BETULIN AND BETULINIC ACID, THAT HAVE ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY. BIRCH BARK
ALSO CONTAINS SALICYLATES, WHICH ARE APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FOR TREATMENT OF WARTS.
IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH BIRCH BARK, YOU CAN TAPE A PIECE OF MOISTENED
BARK DIRECTLY TO THE WART. YOU CAN ALSO BREW UP SOME BIRCH BARK TEA BY ADDING
A TEASPOON OR TWO OF POWDERED BARK TO A CUP OF BOILING WATER AND STEEPING FOR
452
WARTS
PROTECT YOUR SKIN
SOME OF THE SUBSTANCES RECOMMENDED IN
THIS CHAPTER CAN BE QUITE IRRITATING TO THE
SKIN. EVERYONE'S SKIN IS DIFFERENT, SO IF YOU
TRY ONE OF THESE REMEDIES AND IT SEEMS TO
MAKE THE SKIN AROUND THE WART RED AND IRRITATED, RINSE THE AREA THOROUGHLY AND DISCONTINUE USE OF THE HERB.
TEN MINUTES. YOU CAN DRINK THE TEA
AND ALSO RUB IT DIRECTLY ON THE WARTS.
W BLOODROOT (SANGUINARIA
OFFICINALIS). THIS HERB CONTAINS SKINIRRITANT COMPOUNDS (CHELERYTHRINE AND
SANGUINARINE) PLUS PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES, SUBSTANCES THAT HELP DISSOLVE
PROTEINS SUCH AS WART-INFECTED TISSUE.
THIS MAY EXPLAIN BLOODROOT'S FOLK USE
AS A WART REMOVER. LOOK FOR AN OINTMENT CONTAINING THIS HERB.
VV CASTOR (RICINUS COMMUNIS). MANY PEOPLE IN MANY COUNTRIES RECOMMEND CASTOR BEAN OIL FOR WARTS.
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD MASSAGE THE OIL DIRECTLY INTO THE WART SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT TRY TO GIVE THE OIL'S ANTI-WART
EFFECTS A LITTLE BOOST. I'D SUGGEST PUTTING A HANDFUL OF WILLOW BARK INTO THE OIL
AND LETTING IT STEEP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. WILLOW CONTAINS ASPIRIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS KNOWN AS SALICYLATES, WHICH MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL. OTHER HERBALISTS DROP
IN A FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC, ANOTHER FOLK REMEDY FOR WARTS, AND ALLOW THE MIXTURE
TO STEEP FOR A FEW DAYS.
VV CELANDINE (CHELIDONIUM MAJUS). CELANDINE CONTAINS SOME OF THE
SAME COMPOUNDS AS BLOODROOT (CHELERYTHRINE, SANGUINARINE AND PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES). CELANDINE JUICE CAN INHIBIT THE WART VIRUS OR EVEN KILL IT, ACCORDING TO
RUDOLPH FRITZ WEISS, M.D., DEAN OF GERMAN MEDICAL HERBALISTS AND AUTHOR OF
HERBAL MEDICINE. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE FRESH PLANT, YOU MIGHT APPLY THE YELLOW
JUICE DIRECDY TO THE WART ONCE OR TWICE A DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS. OTHERWISE, YOU
CAN TRY APPLYING A STRONG TEA MADE FROM THE DRIED HERB.
VV DANDELION (TARAXACUM OFFICINALE). SEVERAL PROMINENT HERBALISTS
RECOMMEND TREATING WARTS WITH MILKY DANDELION LATEX, THE SUBSTANCE THAT OOZES
OUT WHEN YOU TEAR THE LEAVES AND STEMS. I SUGGEST APPLYING THE WHITE MILK ONCE
A DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS. IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME, BUT YOU CAN GIVE IT A TRY IF
YOU LIKE.
VV FIG (FICUS CARICA). FIGS CONTAIN A PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME KNOWN AS FICIN. IN
MANY CULTURES, PEOPLE USE SEVERAL FIG SPECIES FOR WART TREATMENT. USING THE WHITE
MILK THAT OOZES FROM THE FRUIT AND TWIGS, THEY CLAIM, HELPS REMOVE CORNS AND WARTS.
(THIS PRACTICE FOLLOWS THE LEAD OF KING SOLOMON, WHO USED FIG JUICE ON HIS BOILS.) IF
YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE THIS ANCIENT TREATMENT A TRY, I SUGGEST APPLYING THE MILK ONCE A
DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS.
^ V MILKWEED (ASCLEPIAS, VARIOUS SPECIES). MANY PEOPLE IN MANY
PLACES RECOMMEND USING THE MILKY WHITE FLUID THAT OOZES FROM MILKWEED TO TREAT
4 5 3
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
WARTS. I SUGGEST MASSAGING A LITTLE OF THE FRESH FLUID INTO A WART SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.
AS AN ASIDE, I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTE THAT ABOUT HALF THE FOLK REMEDIES FOR
WARTS INVOLVE MILKY WHITE, GREEN, ORANGE, RED OR YELLOW PLANT RESINS. MANY OF
THESE RESINS CONTAIN PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES. THE ACTIVE ENZYMES COULD HELP SOFTEN
THE WARTS AND PERHAPS EVEN INHIBIT THE VIRUS AS WELL.
VV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSITS). HERE'S ANOTHER PLANT RICH IN PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES. MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST JOHN HEINERMAN, PH.D., AUTHOR OF
HEINERMANS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND HERBS, SUGGESTS CUTTING A
SQUARE OF PINEAPPLE PEEL AND TAPING THE INNER SIDE TO PLANTAR WARTS OVERNIGHT.
THE FOLLOWING MORNING, HE SAYS, REMOVE THE PATCH AND SOAK THE FOOT IN HOT
WATER. STUBBORN CASES MAY REQUIRE SEVERAL APPLICATIONS.
V%> SOYBEAN (GLYCINE MAX). SOYBEANS ARE AN OLD CHINESE MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR WARTS, ACCORDING TO PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. HE CITES A CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL THAT PUBLISHED AN
INTRIGUING STUDY. FOUR PEOPLE WITH WARTS WERE FED ONLY PLAIN, WATER-BOILED
YELLOW SOYBEAN SPROUTS, WITHOUT SEASONING OR SALT, THREE TIMES A DAY FOR JUST
THREE DAYS. "ALL FOUR PATIENTS TREATED WERE CURED AND THEIR WARTS DID NOT REAPPEAR," MAINTAINS DR. LEUNG.
THIS IS A TREATMENT THAT I WOULD TRY MYSELF. THERE'S GOOD EVIDENCE TO SHOW
THAT SOYBEANS ALSO HELP PREVENT CANCER AND HEART DISEASE.
VV WILLOW (SALIX, VARIOUS SPECIES). THE FDA HAS APPROVED SALICYLIC
ACID, WHICH IS FOUND ABUNDANTLY IN WILLOW, FOR WART REMOVAL, AND IT SHOWS UP
IN MANY OVER-THE-COUNTER PREPARATIONS FOR REMOVING WARTS, BUNIONS AND CORNS.
YOU CAN BUY ONE OF THESE PREPARATIONS IF YOU WISH AND FOLLOW THE PACKAGE DIRECTIONS. MY OWN PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO TAPE A PIECE OF MOISTENED INNER BARK
FROM A WILLOW TREE TO THE WART AND CHANGE IT EVERY DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS.
W YELLOW CEDAR (THUJA OCCIDENTALIS). NATUROPATHS SUGGEST APPLYING
OIL OF YELLOW CEDAR TO WARTS. IT CONTAINS ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS, SOME OF WHICH ARE
ALSO FOUND IN MAYAPPLE. DR. WEISS SUGGESTS PAINTING A TINCTURE ON WARTS EACH
MORNING AND NIGHT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. THIS WORKS WELL FOR SMALLER WARTS, HE
SAYS, BUT NOT SO WELL FOR LARGE, SOLID WARTS. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE IT'S WORTH A TRY.
V BANANA (MUSA PARADISIACA). SOME FOLK HEALERS RECOMMEND
SCRAPING THE INNER WHITE PART OF A BANANA PEEL AND RUBBING IT ONTO A WART TWO TO
FOUR TIMES A DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS. THERE'S EVEN A REPORT FROM THE JOURNAL OF
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY OF A CLINICAL TRIAL THAT SUGGESTS THAT THIS TREATMENT SOMETIMES HELPS. I'D BE WILLING TO GIVE IT A TRY.
> BASIL (OCIMUM BASUICUM). THIS AROMATIC HERB CONTAINS MANY ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS. ONE WIDELY PRACTICED FOLK REMEDY FOR WARTS INVOLVES RUBBING CRUSHED BASIL LEAVES ON THE GROWTHS. IF I HAD A WART, I'D SIMPLY APPLY SOME
454
WORM S
FRESH CRUSHED BASIL LEAVES TO THE WART AND COVER IT WITH A BANDAGE, THEN REAPPLY
THE LEAVES AND CHANGE THE DRESSING DAILY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS.
V PAPAYA (CARICA PAPAYA), I'VE TRIED THIS ONE AND IT DIDN'T WORK FOR
ME, BUT MANY FOLK HEALERS AROUND THE WORLD RECOMMEND USING PAPAYA FOR REMOVING WARTS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO TEST IT, APPLY JUICE FROM A FRESH PAPAYA TWICE A
DAY FOR FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS. MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER LUCK THAN I DID.
WORMS
H
ERE'S A LETTER I RECEIVED AFTER ONE OF MY AMAZON ECOTOURS. IT CAME FROM
A TOUR PARTICIPANT WHO DECIDED TO PUT SOME OF THE HERBAL MEDICINES HE
LEARNED ABOUT ON THE TOUR TO THE TEST.
"I ENJOYED FINALLY MEETING YOU AND ATTENDING YOUR LECTURES DURING THE PHARMACY FROM THE RAIN FOREST WORKSHOP LAST FALL IN PERU. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO
KNOW THAT THE FIELD TRIP TO THE LOCAL AGUARDIENTE (RUM) DISTILLERY PROVED TO BE UNEXPECTEDLY EDUCATIONAL.
"I BELIEVE THAT AS A RESULT OF SAMPLING THE FERMENTING BREW PRIOR TO PASTEURIZATION, I UNWITTINGLY INGESTED SOME INTESTINAL PARASITE. AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOLLOWED, BUT MY ABDOMINAL DISTRESS NEVERTHELESS AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO
PUT TO USE SOME OF THE FOLK MEDICINE OF THE REGION THAT YOU DISCUSSED.
"AN INFUSION OF WORMSEED IN WARM MILK RELIEVED ALL MY SYMPTOMS FOR TWO
DAYS," MY CORRESPONDENT CONTINUED.
WHILE I CAN'T BE SURE FROM THIS LETTER THAT THIS FELLOW ACTUALLY HAD WORMS, I
FELT GLAD THAT HE LEARNED SOMETHING AT THE WORKSHOP AND WAS ABLE TO TREAT HIS
SYMPTOMS HERBALLY.
THE WORMS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IN THIS CHAPTER ARE TINY PARASITES THAT
INVADE THE HUMAN INTESTINAL TRACT AND OCCASIONALLY OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY. TRUE
WORMS INCLUDE FLUKEWORMS, HOOKWORMS, PINWORMS, ROUNDWORMS, TAPEWORMS AND
WHIPWORMS.
MORE THAN ONE BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE ARE HOST TO VARIOUS INTESTINAL
WORMS. DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT THIS PROBLEM IS CONFINED TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE NEW YORK TIMES ESTIMATES THAT 25 MILLION AMERICANS,
MOSTLY YOUNG CHILDREN FROM ALL SOCIAL CLASSES, HAVE WORMS.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR WORMS
MAINSTREAM MEDICINE USES A VARIETY OF DRUGS TO TREAT WORMS. THEY ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE, ALTHOUGH SOME MAY CAUSE SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING
4 5 5
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, CRAMPS AND VERTIGO. IF YOU SUSPECT INTESTINAL PARASITES, IT'S A
GOOD IDEA TO GET A DIAGNOSIS FROM A PHYSICIAN AND FOLLOW HIS OR HER ADVICE CONCERNING TREATMENT. THEN DISCUSS THESE HERBAL REMEDIES WITH YOUR DOCTOR. IF YOU
TRY A NATURAL APPROACH, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE
SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY MANY PHARMACEUTICALS.
^^%. GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE). NEW ENGLAND HERBALIST PAUL SCHULICK,
AUTHOR OF GINGER: COMMON SPICE AND WONDER DRUG, STATES THAT THE TANGY ROOT IS
REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE AGAINST SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS PARASITES.
AMONG THESE IS THE ANISAKIS WORM, A JAPANESE WORM THAT IS CARRIED IN RAW
FISH AND IS NOW INCREASINGLY COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES. NO WONDER THE
JAPANESE EAT PICKLED GINGER WITH THEIR RAW FISH DISHES: IN ONE STUDY, A GINGER
EXTRACT IMMOBILIZED MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF ANISAKIS LARVAE WITHIN 4 HOURS
AND DESTROYED THEM IN 16 HOURS.
IF YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF SASHIMI, THE JAPANESE RAW-FISH SPECIALTY, IT PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA TO ADOPT THE JAPANESE CUSTOM OF HAVING SOME PICKLED
GINGER ALONG WITH YOUR MEAL OR SHORTLY AFTERWARD. THIS SHOULD OFFER A MEASURE OF
PROTECTION. IF IT'S NOT SERVED IN THE RESTAURANT WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR SUSHI, YOU
COULD ENJOY A PIECE OR TWO WHEN YOU GET HOME. PICKLED GINGER IS AVAILABLE IN
ASIAN MARKETS AND MANY SPECIALTY FOOD STORES.
THE SAME ADVICE GOES FOR EATING CEVICHE, THE LATIN AMERICAN DISH MADE
FROM MARINATED RAW FISH: TOP OFF YOUR MEAL WITH A PIECE OF PICKLED GINGER.
V"*^ PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO). PUMPKIN SEEDS AND EXTRACTS HAVE BEEN
SHOWN TO IMMOBILIZE AND AID IN THE EXPULSION OF INTESTINAL WORMS AND OTHER PARASITES. AT LEAST ONE PATENT HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR THE USE OF A PUMPKIN EXTRACT IN AN
INTESTINAL WORM TREATMENT. ALTERNATIVE PRACTITIONERS OFTEN SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WITH
INTESTINAL PARASITES EAT ONE OUNCE OF PUMPKIN SEEDS A DAY WHILE THE PROBLEM LASTS.
YOU COULD MUNCH ON PUMPKIN SEEDS AND GINGER FOR A DOUBLE WHAMMY.
VVV WORMSEED (CHENOPODIUM AMBROSIOIDES). WORMSEED IS NOT USED
AS A DEWORMER ONLY IN THE TROPICS. AS A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF MARYLAND, I AM
PROUD TO RELATE THAT WORMSEED WAS ONCE PRODUCED COMMERCIALLY IN MY STATE'S CARROLL AND FREDERICK COUNTIES FOR TREATMENT OF INTESTINAL WORMS IN AMERICAN CHILDREN AND PETS. I'VE ALSO FOUND THAT WORMSEED HELPS RELIEVE GAS, SO I ADD IT TO BEAN
SOUPS. FOR WORMS, I'D TRY A CONCENTRATED TEA. A WORD OF CAUTION: THE CONCENTRATED
WORMSEED OIL IS TOO POTENT TO USE.
YOU'RE FAR MORE LIKELY TO FIND THIS HERB SOLD UNDER THE SPANISH NAME EPAZOTE. ALTHOUGH WORMSEED IS THE CORRECT ENGLISH NAME, NATURAL FOOD STORES TEND
TO SHY AWAY FROM SELLING IT UNDER THIS NAME.
W GARLIC (ALLIUM SATIVUM). NATUROPATH CHRIS DEATHERIDGE, N.D., A MISSOURI HERBALIST, USES GARLIC TO TREAT PINWORMS, ROUNDWORMS, GIARDIA (AN AMOEBA)
456
WORM S
AND OTHER PARASITIC INFECTIONS. HE SUGGESTS JUICING THREE CLOVES WITH FOUR TO SIX
OUNCES OF CARROT JUICE AND TAKING IT EVERY TWO HOURS.
VV PAPAYA (CARICA PAPAYA). HERE'S ANOTHER
PANAMA-PERU CONNECTION: THE CHOCO INDIANS THAT I
STUDIED MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO USED TO TAKE THE
PROTEIN-DIGESTING (PROTEOLYTIC) LATEX OF PAPAYA TO GET RID
OF INTESTINAL PARASITES. MY NEW PERUVIAN INDIAN ^I
FRIENDS HAVE GOTTEN A MITE MORE EFFICIENT AND TIDY:
THEY SWALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN OF THE PELLET-SIZE PAPAYA
SEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME END. I HAVE CHEWED PAPAYA SEEDS, AND THEY ARE ALMOST AS HOT AS MUSTARD
SEEDS.
VV PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). TAPEWORMS MAY CLEAR UP AFTER THREE DAYS OF EATING NOTHING
BUT PINEAPPLE. PINEAPPLE CONTAINS THE PROTEIN-DIGESTING ENZYME BROMELAIN.
VV TURMERIC (CURCUMA LONGA). INDIAN FOLK
HEALERS RECOMMEND THIS TASTY SPICE FOR GETTING RID OF
WORMS, PARTICULARLY NEMATODES. TURMERIC CONTAINS FOUR COMPOUNDS WITH ANTIPARASITIC ACTION. INDIVIDUALLY, EACH OF THESE COMPOUNDS IS INEFFECTIVE, BUT WHEN
THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER, THEY HAVE STRONG WORM-KILLING PROPERTIES. THE BEST WAY
TO TAKE TURMERIC, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IS TO ENJOY CURRY DISHES, IN WHICH IT IS
A KEY INGREDIENT. IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CURRIES' YELLOW COLOR.
V CLOVE (SYSYGIUM AROMATICUM). CLOVES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO
BE ACTIVE AGAINST SEVERAL PARASITES, INCLUDING INTESTINAL WORMS. I'D RECOMMEND
TAKING A STRONG CLOVE TEA OR ADDING POWDERED CLOVES TO PINEAPPLE OR PAPAYA JUICES.
FINALLY, BECAUSE PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES PLAY SUCH A MAJOR ROLE IN WORM TREATMENTS, I'D RECOMMEND MY PROTEOLADE, A FRUIT SMOOTHIE MADE BY BLENDING THE
JUICE AND PULP OF FRUITS THAT ARE WELL-ENDOWED WITH THESE ENZYMES. THESE INCLUDE BREADFRUIT, FIGS, PAPAYA AND PINEAPPLE. SPICE THE BEVERAGE TO TASTE WITH
CLOVES, GINGER AND TURMERIC. (UNLESS YOU LIVE IN THE TROPICS, YOU PROBABLY WON'T
BE ABLE TO GET THE BREADFRUIT. IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE IT OUT.) YOU MIGHT ALSO ADD A
LITTLE PRUNE JUICE AS A LAXATIVE TO HELP EXPEL DISLODGED WORMS.
PAPAYA
THE FRUIT OF THE PAPAYA HAS
PLENTY OF VITAMIN C, WHICH
HELPS BUILD IMMUNITY, AND
HOT-FLAVORED SEEDS THAT HELP
REPEL INTESTINAL WORMS.
457
WRINKLES
WHEN THE TOMB OF KING TUTANKHAMEN, EGYPT'S BOY PHARAOH, WAS
OPENED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAW A TREASURE TROVE OF ARTIFACTS. RESEARCHERS
INTERESTED IN THE AGING PROCESS FOUND SOMETHING ELSE—A PAPYRUS CONTAINING
THE KING'S ANTI-WRINKLE FORMULA: COCONUT OIL AND THE HERBS BALSAM AND VALERIAN
MIXED WITH ANIMAL FAT.
THE PHARAOH'S ANTI-WRINKLE FORMULA WAS NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM MANY
OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN TOUTED THROUGH THE CENTURIES, INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM
BEAR GREASE AND GOOSE GREASE TO TAR AND TURPENTINE. THE BIG QUESTION, OF COURSE,
IS, DO ANY OF THEM REALLY WORK?
LOSING ELASTICITY
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHY SKIN DEVELOPS WRINKLES IN THE FIRST PLACE. WRINKLES RESULT FROM CHANGES IN COLLAGEN, THE PROTEIN
THAT MAKES UP THE FIBROUS PORTION OF YOUR SKIN. COLLAGEN IS WHAT HOLDS YOU TOGETHER. IT MAKES UP ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF YOUR BODY'S TOTAL PROTEIN AND 70 PERCENT
OF YOUR CONNECTIVE TISSUE.
YOUNG SKIN AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE CONTAIN MOSTLY ELASTIC OR SOLUBLE COLLAGEN, AND AS A RESULT, IT CAN ABSORB MOISTURE AND PLUMP UP. THIS ONGOING
PROCESS OF MOISTURIZATION AND SWELLING KEEPS YOUNG, ELASTIC SKIN LOOKING SLEEK
AND SMOOTH. BUT WITH SUN EXPOSURE, CIGARETTE SMOKING AND NORMAL AGING COMES
OXIDATIVE DAMAGE TO THE SKIN. THIS DAMAGE IS THE SAME SORT OF THING THAT HAPPENS TO IRON WHEN IT RUSTS. IN THE BODY, THIS CHEMICAL PROCESS CAUSES THE FORMATION OF INSOLUBLE COLLAGEN, WHICH IS INELASTIC, IS UNABLE TO ABSORB WATER WELL
AND DOES NOT PLUMP UP.
WITH LOSS OF ELASTICITY AND MOISTURE, LINES AND WRINKLES FORM, ESPECIALLY
IN AREAS EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT—THE FACE, THE NECK AND THE BACKS OF THE HANDS.
MANY COMMERCIAL MOISTURIZERS ARE SOLD WITH THE CLAIM THAT THEY RESTORE
SOLUBLE COLLAGEN AND REJUVENATE THE SKIN, ALLOWING SKIN CELLS TO ABSORB MORE
FLUID AND BANISHING WRINKLES. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THESE WORK.
BUT BEFORE YOU SPEND A FORTUNE ON ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS, I'D SUGGEST TRYING
SOME NATURAL APPROACHES.
GREEN PHARMACY FOR WRINKLES
MOST NATURAL ANTI-WRINKLE TREATMENTS RELY ON ANTIOXIDANTS AND EMOLLIENTS.
ANTIOXIDANTS ARE SUBSTANCES THAT MOP UP FREE RADICALS, THE HIGHLY REACTIVE
OXYGEN MOLECULES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. EMOLLIENTS HELP
458
WRINKLE S
PREVENT DRYNESS WHILE MOISTURIZING AND SOFTENING THE SKIN. HERE ARE SOME NATURAL TREATMENTS THAT MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL.
V W HORSE CHESTNUT (AESCULUS HIPPOCASTANUM) AND WITCH HAZEL
(HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA), JAPANESE SCIENTISTS TESTED 65 PLANT EXTRACTS AND
FOUND SEVEN THAT SHOWED SUFFICIENT ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY TO HAVE POTENTIAL AGAINST
WRINKLES. THE FOUR THAT YOU PROBABLY CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON ARE HORSE CHESTNUT,
WITCH HAZEL, ROSEMARY AND SAGE, BUT THE RESEARCHERS SINGLED OUT HORSE CHESTNUT
AND WITCH HAZEL AS THE BEST. BOTH OF THESE ARE STRONG ANTIOXIDANTS. SOOTHING AND
ASTRINGENT SALVES CONTAINING THESE HERBS ARE AVAILABLE AT HEALTH FOOD STORES, BUT I
PREFER TO MIX THEM MYSELF.
W CARROT (DAUCUS CAROTA). CARROTS ARE HIGH IN VITAMIN A, AND DEFICIENCIES OF THIS VITAMIN CAUSE DRY SKIN AND WRINKLING. CARROTS ALSO CONTAIN THE ANTIOXIDANT BETA-CAROTENE. I'D SUGGEST MUNCHING A CARROT OR TWO A DAY, NOT ONLY TO
PREVENT WRINKLES BUT FOR ALL THE CANCER-PREVENTIVE CHEMICALS THAT THIS VEGETABLE
CONTAINS.
YOU MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER TOPICAL APPLICATION OF CARROT OIL. ITS HIGH LEVELS OF
VITAMIN A MAKE IT A GOOD SUNSCREEN, ACCORDING TO AUBREY HAMPTON, AUTHOR OF
NATURAL ORGANIC HAIR AND SKIN CARE. I CONFESS I'VE NEVER TRIED CARROT OIL, BUT
ON OCCASION, I'VE MASHED CARROTS IN A BLENDER AND EXPERIMENTALLY APPLIED THE
MASH AS A FACE MASK. SOMEONE ONCE EVEN CALLED ME A HANDSOME OLD REDNECK.
(WASH THE MASHED CARROT OFF AFTER 15 TO 30 MINUTES.)
VV COCOA (THEOBROMA CACAO). A MAJOR EMOLLIENT USED IN SKIN LOTIONS
AND COSMETICS, COCOA BUTTER IS THE LEADING ANTI-WRINKLE SUGGESTION OF PHARMACOGNOSIST (NATURAL PRODUCT PHARMACIST) ALBERT LEUNG, PH.D. IT MELTS AT BODY TEMPERATURE AND REMOISTURIZES DRY SKIN, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE EYES (CROW'S-FEET), THE
CORNERS OF THE MOUTH AND ON THE NECK (TURKEY NECK). I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT COMES
FROM THE AMAZON. ANOTHER SIMILAR TROPICAL EMOLLIENT IS COCONUT OIL.
VV CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS). COOL, MOIST CUCUMBER HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USE FOR SOOTHING BURNS, INCLUDING SUNBURN, AND PREVENTING WRINKLES. CUCUMBERS ARE CHEAPER AND PROBABLY AS USEFUL AS MANY COMMERCIAL MOISTURIZERS.
YOU CAN CUT THIN, DISK-SHAPED SECTIONS AND WIPE THEM ON YOUR SKIN. YOU CAN ALSO
WHIP THEM IN YOUR BLENDER AND APPLY THE MASH AS A FACE MASK. RINSE IT OFF AFTER 15
TO 30 MINUTES.
VV PURSLANE (PORTULACA OLERACEA). THIS PLANT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANTIOXIDANTS. IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO FRESH PURSLANE, USE IT AS A SALAD INGREDIENT. OR
TRY IT IN A SOOTHING FACIAL MASK. PUT THE HERB THROUGH A BLENDER OR JUICER AND DAB IT
ON YOUR FACE, WASHING IT OFF AFTER 15 TO 30 MINUTES.
VV ROSEMARY (ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS). ANOTHER POTENT ANTIOXIDANT,
ROSEMARY WAS IDENTIFIED BY JAPANESE RESEARCHERS AS A PROMISING WRINKLE PREVENTIVE AND TREATMENT. USE IT AS A CULINARY SPICE OR MAKE A TEA WITH A TEASPOON OR TWO
459
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
OF CRUSHED, DRIED LEAVES PER CUP OF BOILING WATER. YOU COULD ALSO BLEND IT WITH YOUR
PURSLANE.
VV SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). ALONG WITH HORSE CHESTNUT, WITCH HAZEL AND
ROSEMARY, SAGE WAS THE OTHER COMMON HERB IDENTIFIED BY THE JAPANESE RESEARCHERS,
ALTHOUGH IT'S SOMEWHAT LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHERS. USE IT AS A CULINARY SPICE OR
TRY A USING A TEASPOON OR TWO OF DRIED, CRUSHED LEAVES PER BOILING WATER TO MAKE A
TEA. IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE JUDICIOUS, THOUGH, AS SAGE CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF THUJONE, A COMPOUND THAT IN VERY HIGH DOSES MAY CAUSE CONVULSIONS.
VV LAC-HYDRIN. THIS DRUGSTORE ITEM ISN'T EXACTLY AN HERB, BUT IT IS A NATURAL PRODUCT. LAC-HYDRIN IS AN ALPHA-HYDROXY ACID (AHA) FOUND IN FRUITS, SOUR
MILK AND SUGAR CANE. AHAS, OFTEN CALLED FRUIT ACIDS, HELP PEEL OFF DEAD SKIN CELLS
BY DISSOLVING CERAMIDES, WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT HOLD THE CELLS TOGETHER.
CLEARING DEAD CELLS OFF THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN REVEALS THE PLUMP, LIVING CELLS UNDERNEATH AND CONTRIBUTES TO A YOUNGER APPEARANCE. DERMATOLOGISTS USE STRONG CONCENTRATIONS OF AHAS FOR FACE PEELS.
LAC-HYDRIN ALSO INCREASES THE THICKNESS OF THE OUTERMOST LAYER OF LIVING
SKIN CELLS (THE EPIDERMIS), INCREASING THE SKIN'S ABILITY TO HOLD MOISTURE AND
THUS SMOOTHING OUT FINE LINES AND WRINKLES.
UNLIKE SOME ANTI-AGING TREATMENTS SUCH AS RETIN-A, LAC-HYDRIN DOES NOT
CAUSE SUN SENSITIVITY. IN ONE STUDY, LAC-HYDRIN WAS APPLIED TWICE A DAY FOR SIX
MONTHS, AND IT DIMINISHED FINE WRINKLES NOTICEABLY IN 90 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
USING IT.
V ALMOND (PRUNUS DULCIS). ALMOND OIL, MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE AND
ONCE USED FOR ANOINTING KINGS AND PRIESTS, HAS INCREASINGLY WORKED ITS WAY INTO
THE COSMETIC AND PERFUME WORLD. YOU CAN USE IT AS AN EMOLLIENT AND MASSAGE IT
INTO YOUR SKIN TO SLOW WRINKLING.
V ALOE (ALOE VERA). IT'S HARD TO SEPARATE ALOE HYPE FROM FACT. CLEOPATRA IS
SAID TO HAVE MASSAGED ALOE GEL ONTO HER FACE DAILY. NAPOLEON'S WIFE, JOSEPHINE,
ADDED THE GEL TO MILK TO MAKE A FACE LOTION. AND ALOE IS AN INGREDIENT IN MANY
MODERN SKIN-CARE PRODUCTS. DOES IT HELP PREVENT WRINKLES? IT PROBABLY CAN'T HURT
TO GIVE IT A TRY.
V AVOCADO (PERSEA AMERICANA). PLEASANDY SCENTED AVOCADO OIL IS AN
EMOLLIENT THAT'S ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH DRY SKIN. JUST APPLY IT DIRECDY TO YOUR FACE.
V CASTOR (RICINUS COMMUNIS). THE OIL OF THE CASTOR BEAN HAS BEEN USED
SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES AS A FACIAL OIL AND MAKEUP INGREDIENT. IT'S CLEARLY AN EMOLLIENT, AND I'D GUESS THAT IF IT DIDN'T DO SOME GOOD, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCARDED
GENERATIONS AGO.
V GRAPE (VHIS VINIFERA). GRAPES CONTAIN AHAS, THE SUBSTANCES THAT HELP
460
YEAS T INFECTION S
PEEL DEAD SKIN CELLS FROM THE FACE. AHAS APPEAR IN DOZENS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER
(OTC) SKIN LOTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT CLAIM TO ELIMINATE FINE LINES AND WRINKLES. BUT INSTEAD OF OPTING FOR AN OTC, WHY NOT GO TO A NATURAL SOURCE? YOU CAN
PROCESS GRAPES, EVEN SEEDED VARIETIES, IN A JUICER AND APPLY THE MASH AS A FACIAL
MASK. RINSE IT OFF AFTER 15 TO 30 MINUTES.
V OLIVE (OLEA EUROPEA). THE PROPHET HOSEA SAID, "BEAUTY SHALL BE AS
THE OLIVE TREE." HE DIDN'T SAY, "WRINKLES SHALL BE REMOVED WITH THE OLIVE OIL." BUT
SINCE BIBLICAL TIMES, OLIVE OIL HAS BEEN USED TO SOFTEN AND BEAUTIFY THE SKIN. OLIVE
OIL, AS AN EMOLLIENT, JUST MIGHT HELP SLOW WRINKLING. MANY WOMEN STEAM THEIR
FACES GENDY BEFORE APPLYING IT.
V PINEAPPLE (ANANAS COMOSUS). IF THE AHAS IN PINEAPPLE HUSKS CAN
REALLY REMOVE BUNIONS AND CORNS, AS I'VE READ, I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO LIQUEFY THE
PEEL AND CORE FROM A WHOLE PINEAPPLE IN MY BLENDER AND APPLY THE MASH TO HELP
REMOVE THE SURFACE LAYER OF DEAD SKIN CELLS. RINSE IT OFF AFTER 15 TO 30 MINUTES.
(AS A COM REMOVER, YOU WOULD KEEP THE PINEAPPLE ON MUCH LONGER.)
^EAST INIECTIOIIS
MOST PEOPLE THINK OF YEAST INFECTIONS, ALSO KNOWN AS CANDIDIASIS, AS A
PLAGUE ONLY UPON WOMEN. BUT MEN CAN ALSO DEVELOP CANDIDIASIS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE UNCIRCUMCISED, A MAN WITH YEAST TYPICALLY SHOWS NO
SYMPTOMS, BUT EACH TIME HIS PARTNER IS TREATED AND GETS RID OF HER INFECTION, HE
REINFECTS HER. SO IF YOU'RE A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YEAST INFECTIONS, BE SURE YOUR PARTNER IS CHECKED, TOO: BOTH OF YOU MIGHT NEED SOME OF
THESE HERBAL REMEDIES.
YEAST INFECTION IS CAUSED BY A GROUP OF YEASTLIKE FUNGI CALLED CANDIDA.
CANDIDA ALBICANS IS THE MOST COMMON CULPRIT, BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.
EVERYONE HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CANDIDA LIVING ON THEM AND IN THEM, BUT NOT
EVERYONE DEVELOPS CANDIDIASIS.
YEAST LIVE ON MOIST AREAS OF THE BODY, SUCH AS THE LINING OF THE MOUTH AND
THE VAGINA. THEY USUALLY CAUSE NO PROBLEM, BUT SOMETIMES THEY OVERGROW,
CAUSING INFECTION. THE VAGINA IS THE PRIMARY SITE. (SEE THE CHAPTER ON VAGINITIS
ON PAGE 441 FOR DETAILS ABOUT GREEN PHARMACY TREATMENTS FOR THIS PROBLEM.)
BUT YEAST INFECTIONS CAN ALSO DEVELOP IN THE MOUTH (THRUSH), IN THE RESPIRATORY
TRACT (BRONCHOCANDIDIASIS) AND ON THE SKIN (DERMATOCANDIDIASIS).
YEAST HAS BECOME MORE OF PROBLEM THAN IT WAS, SAY, 60 YEARS AGO, BECAUSE
461
CHOOSIN G TH E HERB S THA T HEA L
SEVERAL MODERN DRUGS SPUR YEAST
OVERGROWTH. AMONG THE LEADING CULPRITS ARE ANTIBIOTICS, STEROIDS AND
BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.
MAINSTREAM MEDICINE TREATS
YEAST INFECTIONS WITH ANTIFUNGAL
MEDICATIONS THAT USED TO BE AVAILABLE ONLY BY PRESCRIPTION. BUT RECENTLY SEVERAL, SUCH AS NYSTATIN
(MYCOSTATIN) AND MICONAZOLE (MONISTAT), HAVE BECOME AVAILABLE OVER
THE COUNTER, AND THEY ARE ADVERTISED
EXTENSIVELY. IT'S TOO BAD THAT HERBALISTS CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE TV COMMERCIALS. IF THEY COULD, PEOPLE
WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE WAY TO TREAT A YEAST INFECTION.
GREEN PHARMACY
FOR YEAST INFECTIONS
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HERBS
THAT CAN HELP FIGHT YEAST INFECTIONS,
BUT YOU'D BETTER BE SURE OF WHAT
YOU'RE DEALING WITH BEFORE YOU SELFMEDICATE. IF YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SUSPECT IS A YEAST INFECTION, PLEASE SEE
YOUR DOCTOR FOR A DIAGNOSIS. THEN, IF
YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AN HERBAL ALTERNATIVE
AS YOUR TREATMENT OF CHOICE, YOU SHOULD DISCUSS IT WITH HER. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
USING THESE HERBS IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER IS PRESCRIBED FOR YOU.
V W ECHINACEA (ECHINACEA, VARIOUS SPECIES). THIS HERB'S IMMUNE-STIMULATING ACTION SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR TREATING YEAST INFECTIONS. IN
STUDIES USING LABORATORY ANIMALS, TREATMENT WITH THE HERB PROTECTED MICE FROM
CANDIDA ALBICANS INFECTIONS. IT WORKS BY STIMULATING THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS TO
GOBBLE UP YEAST ORGANISMS, A PROCESS KNOWN AS PHAGOCYTOSIS.
IN AN IMPRESSIVE GERMAN STUDY, WOMEN WITH RECURRENT VAGINAL YEAST INFECTIONS WERE GIVEN EITHER STANDARD ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION OR THE ANTIFUNGAL
PLUS AN ECHINACEA EXTRACT. AMONG THOSE TAKING JUST THE ANTIFUNGAL, 60 PERCENT
CANDIDICIDOL SOUP
IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE AGGRAVATION OF
RECURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ONE OF THE BEST
THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR YOURSELF IS TO DEVELOP A TASTE FOR GARLIC AND ONIONS. HERE'S
A TASTY SOUP THAT MIGHT HELP.
4 CUPS WATER
2 ONIONS, FINELY CHOPPED
4 CLOVES GARLIC, MINCED
SAGE
THYME
GROUND CLOVES
SALT
GROUND BLACK PEPPER
ACIDOPHILUS YOGURT
PLACE THE WATER, GARLIC AND ONIONS IN A
MEDIUM SAUCEPAN. BRING TO A BOIL OVER
HIGH HEAT, THEN REDUCE THE HEAT, COVER
AND SIMMER FOR 5 MINUTES, OR UNTIL THE
VEGETABLES ARE TENDER. SEASON TO TASTE
WITH THE SAGE, THYME, CLOVES, SALT AND
PEPPER, BUT USE THE SPICES SOMEWHAT
SPARINGLY. TOP EACH SERVING WITH A DOLLOP
OF YOGURT.
MAKES 4 SERVINGS
462
YEAS T INFECTION S
SUFFERED RECURRENCES. BUT AMONG THE WOMEN TAKING THE DRUG PLUS ECHINACEA,
ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT EXPERIENCED RECURRENCES. THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A GOOD
RATIONALE FOR GIVING ECHINACEA A TRY NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF YEAST INFECTION
YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
V*^, GARLIC {ALLIUM SATIVUM). GARLIC IS WELL-KNOWN AS AN ANTIBACTERIAL ANTIBIOTIC, BUT IT ALSO INHIBITS FUNGI QUITE WELL AND CAN BE USED TO TREAT BOTH
VAGINAL CANDIDIASIS AND THRUSH. THE TYPICAL ORAL DOSE MAY RANGE UP TO A DOZEN
RAW, CHOPPED CLOVES TAKEN TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY IN JUICE. YOU HAVE TO LIKE
THE TASTE OF GARLIC PRETTY MUCH TO LIVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR TREATMENT, BUT I THINK
IT'S WORTH A TRY, AS GARLIC DOES PACK A POWERFUL ANTI-YEAST WALLOP. (TRY BLENDING
IT WITH CARROTS; IT'S SURPRISINGLY EASY TO TAKE THAT WAY.) ONIONS HAVE A SIMILAR
BUT LESS POTENT EFFECT.
VV CRANBERRY (VACCINIUM MACROCARPON).
ARBUTIN, A COMPOUND FOUND IN CRANBERRIES (AND
BEARBERRIES AND BLUEBERRIES), HELPS TREAT CANDIDA
INFECTIONS, ACCORDING TO NATUROPATHS JOSEPH PIZZORNO, N.D., PRESIDENT OF BASTYR UNIVERSITY IN
SEATTLE, AND MICHAEL MURRAY, N.D., AUTHORS OF A
TEXTBOOK OF NATURAL MEDICINE. SO IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF TAKING GARLIC, WHY NOT TAKE IT WITH CRANBERRY
JUICE? OR JUST EAT SOME CRANBERRY SAUCE PLAIN.
THESE COLORFUL BERRIES ARE NOT JUST FOR THANKSGIVING.
W GOLDENSEAL (HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS).
THIS IS THE BEST KNOWN AMONG THE "GOLDEN" HERBS
THAT CONTAIN THE ANTIBIOTIC BERBERINE. OTHERS INCLUDE GOLDTHREAD, YELLOWROOT, BARBERRY AND OREGON
GRAPE. BERBERINE IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST MANY MICROORGANISMS, INCLUDING YEASTS. AT HOME, I TAKE A
TINCTURE. IN THE FIELD, I'D MAKE A TEA. YOU CAN USE IT
EITHER WAY.
VV PAU-D'ARCO (TABEBUIA, VARIOUS SPECIES). PAU-D'ARCO CONTAINS THE
ANTI-YEAST COMPOUNDS LAPACHOL AND BETA-LAPACHONE, ACCORDING TO DR. MURRAY,
DR. PIZZORNO AND OTHER RESEARCHERS. LAPACHOL IS THE WEAKER OF THE TWO, BUT ITS
ANTI-YEAST ACTION IS STILL COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE PRESCRIPTION ANTI-YEAST MEDICATION KETACONAZOLE (NIZORAL). I HAVE USED A LATIN AMERICAN SALVE CONTAINING
LAPACHOL TO CLEAR UP GENITAL CANDIDA, AND I WOULD DO SO AGAIN IF I HAD A FLAREUP. FLARE-UPS ARE FREQUENT IN THE HUMID TROPICS. IN THE TROPICS, I'D BOIL UP A
CONCENTRATED DECOCTION. AT HOME, I'D EMPTY A COUPLE OF CAPSULES INTO A MEDICATED SALVE.
CRANBERRY
THE TART BERRY THAT LENDS A
DISTINCTIVE TASTE TO
CRANBERRY JUICE AND SAUCE
WAS USED BY NINETEENTHCENTURY PHYSICIANS TO
RELIEVE INFLAMMATION.
463
CHOOSING THE HERBS THAT HEAL
VV PURSLANE {PORTULACA OLERACEA). VITAMINS A (AND BETA-CAROTENE), C
AND E ARE MY PERSONAL "ACE IN THE HOLE" FOR SUPPORTING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.
YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO GIVE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HELP WHEN IT'S FIGHTING A YEAST
INFECTION OF ANY KIND. PURSLANE IS THE BEST FOOD SOURCE OF ALL OF THESE NUTRIENTS.
I SUGGEST ENJOYING YOUNG SHOOTS OF THIS TASTY VEGETABLE IN A SALAD OR STEAMING
THE LEAVES LIKE SPINACH.
V GOLDENROD (SOLIDAGO VIRGAUREA). COMMISSION E, THE GROUP OF
BOTANICAL MEDICINE EXPERTS THAT ADVISES THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ABOUT HERBS,
APPROVES USING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GOLDENROD FOR PREVENTING AND TREATING VARIOUS UROGENITAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING YEAST INFECTIONS. COMPOUNDS IN GOLDENROD
(ESTER SAPONINS) ARE ACTIVE AGAINST CANDIDA ORGANISMS. THIS HERB CAN BE USED
AS AN ASTRINGENT BEVERAGE TEA, AND YOU CAN ALSO USE THE TEA AS A DOUCHE.
V IVY (HEDERA HELIX). IVY LEAVES ARE ACTIVE AGAINST CANDIDA AND QUITE A
FEW BACTERIA. COMMISSION E ENDORSES USING 0.3 GRAM (THAT'S JUST A PINCH OF
DRIED HERB) FOR VARIOUS CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS, AND THAT SEEMS LIKE
A REASONABLE DOSE FOR FIGHTING YEAST INFECTIONS AS WELL. YOU CAN STEEP THE HERB
IN HOT WATER FOR ABOUT 10 TO 15 MINUTES AND DRINK THE TEA.
V LICORICE (GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA) AND STEVIA (STEVIA REBAUDIANA).
MANY SPECIALISTS ADVISE THOSE WITH RECURRENT YEAST PROBLEMS AGAINST USING ALCOHOL, PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN YEAST AND SIMPLE SUGARS. IF YOU'VE HAD A YEAST INFECTION BEFORE AND WANT TO PREVENT A FRESH OUTBREAK, YOU SHOULD STEER CLEAR OF HONEY
AND SUGAR. IF YOU'D LIKE TO SWEETEN ANTI-CANDIDA TEAS, TRY USING HERBAL SWEETENERS
LIKE LICORICE ROOT OR STEVIA.
V SAGE (SALVIA OFFICINALIS). SAGE CONTAINS A MIXTURE OF ANTI-CANDIDA
COMPOUNDS. YOU COULD TAKE SAGE TEA AS A BEVERAGE OR USE IT AS AN ASTRINGENT
DOUCHE. IF YOU'RE USING IT AS A DOUCHE, YOU MIGHT ADD A DROP OR TWO OF TEATREE OIL,
A POTENT ANTI-YEAST HERBAL PRODUCT.
V SPICEBUSH (LINDERA BENZOIN). STUDYING 54 PLANT SPECIES FOR ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS, AMERICAN SCIENTISTS FOUND THAT AN EXTRACT OF SPICEBUSH BARK
STRONGLY INHIBITED CANDIDA ALBICANS. THROUGHOUT APPALACHIA, SPICEBUSH TEA HAS
LONG BEEN A FAVORITE, PROVING ONCE AGAIN THE WISDOM OF MUCH FOLK MEDICINE.

A LIIETIME
OR LOVING PLANTS
I
'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN PLANTS FOR AT LEAST 62 OF MY 67 YEARS. MY INTEREST
COMES FROM MY MOTHER, WHO LOVED PLANTS AND RAISED ME TO LOVE THEM AS
SHE DID.
MUCH OF MY EARLY BOTANICAL INTEREST IS SHROUDED IN THE MISTS OF MEMORY. I
RECALL ONLY SNIPPETS: PLAYING WITH WHITE COUSINS AND BLACK NEIGHBORS IN THE
WOODS AND PASTURES ALONG THE KOOSA RIVER OUTSIDE BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, NEAR
MY GRANDFATHER TRUSS'S FARM; VISITING UNCLE BILL'S NURSERY AND SKINNY-DIPPING
IN THE CAHABA RIVER. EVEN THOUGH I WAS BOM AND LIVED IN THE EAST LAKE
SUBURB OF BIRMINGHAM, WE FREQUENTLY GOT OUT TO SEE THE COUNTRY COUSINS, WHERE
WE PLAYED IN THE COUNTRYSIDE FORESTS AND FIELDS.
EVEN IN BIRMINGHAM, THE FORESTS WERE CLOSE BY. WE HAD CHICKENS, A SMALL
VEGETABLE GARDEN AND ARBORS BEARING MAGNIFICENT SCUPPERNONG GRAPES. MY
GRANDMOTHER MADE DELICIOUS SCUPPERNONG JUICE, AND I'VE HAD A LIFELONG LOVE
AFFAIR WITH SCUPPERNONG FRUIT (VITIS ROTUNDIFOLIA). IF BY SOME FLUKE THIS SINNER
MAKES IT TO HEAVEN, I IMAGINE I WILL BE GREETED JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PEARLY
GATES BY MY GRANDMOTHER, OFFERING ME A TALL CHILLED GLASS OF SCUPPERNONG JUICE.
LEARNING TO EAT "WEEDS"
IN BIRMINGHAM, LONELY OLD MR. BROOKS LIVED ACROSS THE STREET. HE HAD NO
CLOSE FRIENDS OR FAMILY, AND HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME TALKING TO HIS RABBITS IN
THEIR HUTCH—AND TO ME. HE TOOK ME FOR WALKS IN THE NEARBY WOODS, AND HE INTRODUCED ME TO THE WORLD OF EDIBLE WILD PLANTS SUCH AS CHESTNUTS AND WATERCRESS. SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A KEEN INTEREST IN EDIBLE PLANTS. AND
WALKING IN THE WOODS IS STILL MY NUMBER ONE THERAPY FOR PERSONAL REJUVENATION.
BUT IN ADDITION TO PLANTS, ANOTHER INTEREST ALSO CREPT IN. STARTING AT AROUND
AGE FIVE, I SOLD MAGAZINES AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY (NOW SAMFORD UNIVERSITY), JUST
A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME. WE WERE PRETTY POOR IN THOSE DAYS, AND THE GUYS IN
THE DORM WOULD BUY THE MAGAZINES, MORE OUT OF PITY FOR SCRAGGLY ME THAN BECAUSE THEY WANTED THEM.
IN ONE DORM, THERE WAS A GROUP OF BLUEGRASS MUSICIANS. I LOVED WHAT THEY
PLAYED, AND COUNTRY MUSIC SEEMED TO GO QUITE WELL WITH ALL THE COUNTRY PLANTS
465
AUTHOR' S POSTSCRIP T
THAT MY MOMMA AND MR. BROOKS WERE TEACHING ME TO LOVE. BOTANY AND COUNTRY
MUSIC—THEY MAY NOT GO HAND-IN-HAND FOR MANY PEOPLE, BUT THEY ALWAYS
HAVE FOR ME.
CNILAREN'S GARDEN OF DELIGFNT
WHEN I WAS SEVEN, WE WERE WHISKED AWAY FROM THE FIELDS OF ALABAMA TO
DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE MY DAD HOPED TO ESCAPE COUNTRY POVERTY BY
GETTING INTO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. WE WERE STILL POOR, BUT I WAS HAPPY, AND
SO WERE MY OLDER BROTHER, ED, AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER, DAN, JUST LIKE POOR CHILDREN ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
FOR A WHILE WE LIVED IN A SUCCESSION OF LOW-RENT APARTMENTS AND BUNGALOWS. ONE APARTMENT WAS A THREE-STORY TENEMENT THAT BORDERED A VACANT LOT
FILLED WITH HONEYSUCKLE. I HAVE HAPPY MEMORIES OF MY BROTHERS AND ME TUNNELING THROUGH THE HONEYSUCKLE VINES AND PLAYING OUR GAMES. ONE OF THE BUNGALOWS WAS CLOSE TO THE FAMOUS DUKE GARDENS OF DUKE UNIVERSITY. MOTHER
PLANTED A SMALL GARDEN JUST OUTSIDE OUR APARTMENT, AND I HELPED HER TEND THE
FLOWERS. JOKINGLY, WE CALLED IT LITTLE DUKE GARDENS.
I SHOULD ADD THAT I AM NOT RELATED TO THE TOBACCO DUKES (DUKE UNIVERSITY
WAS NAMED FOR ONE MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY) NOR TO THE FAMOUS DORIS DUKE. I
COME FROM COTTON-PICKING DUKES OF ALABAMA, AND I STILL HAVE DOZENS OF COUNTRY
COUSINS DOWN THERE. RECENTLY, ONE COUSIN TOLD ME THAT MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER DUKE WAS AN HERBAL DOCTOR, SO MAYBE HERBS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN MY
BLOOD.
FROM MY MOTHER'S GARDEN, I GRADUATED TO A PART-TIME JOB HELPING OUT IN A
FLORIST'S GREENHOUSE NEARBY, WHERE I ADDED A GREAT DEAL TO WHAT I ALREADY KNEW
ABOUT ORNAMENTAL FLOWERS.
WHEN I WAS ABOUT NINE, DAD'S INSURANCE BUSINESS PICKED UP, SO WE MOVED
TO RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, AND PURCHASED A LARGE HOUSE WITH A BIG YARD. MOM
AND DAD AND I PLANTED OUR FIRST VEGETABLE GARDEN, AND MY BOTANICAL HORIZONS
EXPANDED TO VEGETABLES. MOM ALSO PUT IN A BIG BATCH OF FOUR-O'CLOCKS, INTRODUCING ME TO WHAT LATER BECAME A GREAT INTEREST OF MINE, FLORAL CLOCKS.
THE CALL OF TKE WILD
THERE WERE THICK WOODS NEARBY, AND I EXPLORED THEM ENDLESSLY, SOMETIMES
ALONE AND SOMETIMES WITH MY FRIENDS, A RATHER GENDE GANG OF BOYS. WE ROVED THE
WOODS, STAKING OUT CAMPSITES AND DEFENDING THEM FROM IMAGINARY ENEMIES.
ONE FRIEND'S DAD HAD A FARM A FEW MILES OUT IN THE COUNTRY. WE USED TO GO
CAMPING OUT THERE, SETTING UP TENTS IN THE COLD, WHISTLING PINES (EVEN IN WINTER),
FISHING IN THE FARM POND AND CHALLENGING EACH OTHER TO NAME ALL THE WILDFLOWERS.
466
A LIFETIME O F LOVIN G PLANT S
THE WORST THING I EVER DID THERE STILL HAUNTS ME. WE'D WATCH FROGS BY THE
POND AND SEE THEIR THROATS SWELL UP LIKE BALLOONS AS THEY CROAKED. WE HAD BB
GUNS, AND WITH THE UNCONSCIOUS CRUELTY OF BOYS, I AIMED AT ONE FROG'S BALLOONTHROAT AND PULLED THE TRIGGER. I HIT THE MARK, DEFLATING HIS SONG-MAKING BALLOON.
I HAVE REGRETTED IT EVER SINCE. I DON'T SUPPOSE IT KILLED HIM, BUT HE NEVER SANG
AGAIN, AND THE FOREST WAS THE QUIETER FOR IT. SINCE THEN, I HAVE KILLED A FEW FROGS
AND OTHER ANIMALS, BUT ONLY FOR FOOD IN THE FIELD. FROM THAT TIME ON, I ABANDONED MUTILATION OR KILLING FOR SPORT.
I MISSED OUT ON CUB SCOUTS, BUT I JOINED THE BOY SCOUTS AT THE TABERNACLE
BAPTIST CHURCH NEAR MY HOME. THE RITUALS AND UNIFORM DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR ME,
BUT I WAS VERY TURNED ON BY THE CAMPING TRIPS AND MADE AS MANY AS I COULD
OVER THE YEARS, LEARNING THE FOREST AND ITS PLANTS EVEN BETTER. MOTHER MADE ME
A SLEEPING BAG THAT WAS WATERPROOFED BY IRONING ON PARAFFIN. IT WEIGHED A TON,
BUT IT KEPT ME DRY AND WARM. I ALSO WENT ON MANY NON-SCOUT CAMPING TRIPS.
THE FOREST AS TEMPLE
BY HIGH SCHOOL, MUSIC AND PUPPY LOVE STARTED COMPETING WITH THE FOREST
FOR MY ATTENTION. EVEN AS EARLY AS THE SIXTH GRADE, I WAS SINGING COUNTRY SONGS.
MY GIRLFRIEND, GRETA LEWIS, WAS INVOLVED IN MY BAPTIST CHURCH. HER PARENTS
DIDN'T LIKE ME, BUT THEY TOLERATED ME BECAUSE OF MY CHURCH CONNECTION.
AND THEN, ALL AT ONCE, I EXPERIENCED A LOSS MUCH GREATER THAN I HAD WHEN I
LEARNED THAT THERE WAS NO SANTA CLAUS. FACED WITH THE INFINITY OF THE UNIVERSE,
I LOST FAITH IN A THEOCRATIC GOD. THAT DOOMED GRETA AND ME. BUT I BELIEVED
DEEPLY IN THE FOREST, IN ITS INFINITE BEAUTY AND HEALING POWER. THE FOREST BECAME MY TEMPLE, MY THEOLOGY. IT'S BEEN MY SALVATION EVER SINCE.
MY OLDER BROTHER HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS WELL-KNOWN AROUND RALEIGH AS A
WILD MUSHROOM HUNTER (MYCOLOGIST), AND WE OFTEN WENT INTO THE WOODS WITH
HIM, TRYING TO NAME ALL THE PLANTS. HE AND MY BROTHER BOTH HAD PART-TIME JOBS
AT CRABTREE (NOW UMSTEAD) STATE PARK, AND I HAD BECOME ENAMORED OF THAT WILD
PLACE, WITH ITS MILES OF SECRET WATERWAYS. I SPENT SEEMINGLY ENDLESS HOURS CANOEING THROUGH UMSTEAD, SILENTLY OBSERVING THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS; THEY APPARENTLY ASSUMED THAT I WAS JUST ANOTHER LOG—ALBEIT ODDLY SHAPED—FLOATING
DOWN THE CREEKS.
ANOTHER NEIGHBOR WAS A FORESTER WHO BECAME IMPRESSED WITH MY BUDDING
KNOWLEDGE OF FIELD BOTANY. EVENTUALLY, HE GOT ME MY FIRST SUMMER JOB AT UMSTEAD PARK, WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PAID ME TO DO ALL THE THINGS I LOVED TO DO: HIKE,
CAMP, CANOE AND TAKE STOCK OF THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS WITH THE HELP OF MY
TRUSTY TREE BOOKS, BIRD BOOKS AND FLOWER BOOKS. I GOT PRETTY GOOD AT LIVING OFF
THE LAND.
467
AUTHOR' S POSTSCRIP T
MEANWHILE, I STARTED PLAYING THE GUITAR, AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE THE GUITAR
BECAME AS CLOSE A FRIEND AS THE FOREST. I NEVER FELT ALONE IN THE FOREST OR WITH
MY GUITAR. I WAS ALWAYS LISTENING TO COUNTRY MUSIC AND TRYING TO PLAY IT. I HAD A
PRETTY GOOD EAR AND COULD PICK UP SONGS QUICKLY. I KNEW WHERE ALL THE COUNTRY
MUSIC WAS ON THE RADIO AND LISTENED AT ALL HOURS.
TENTH GRADE AT HUGH MORSON HIGH FOUND ME IN MISS BEDDINGFIELD'S BIOLOGY
CLASS. SHE WAS FAMOUS FOR MAKING EVERYONE IN THE CLASS COLLECT AND IDENTIFY 40
FLOWERS. I COLLECTED OVER 100 AND BECAME LEGENDARY IN MY CLASS AS A RESULT.
MUSIC BECKONS
MEANWHILE, TWO BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTES ARRIVED AT SCHOOL. THEY WERE PART OF
THE SAYLOR SISTERS, A COUNTRY VOCAL GROUP THAT FD HEARD ON THE RADIO. ONE OF THE
SISTERS, JEANNIE, OFFERED TO TEACH ME TO PLAY THE BASS FIDDLE SO THAT I COULD ACCOMPANY THEM WHEN THEY SANG. ONLY I DIDN'T HAVE A BASS. OF COURSE, I WOULD
HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SPEND TIME WITH HER, SO I LEANED ON MY DAD AND HE SPLIT
THE COST OF A BASS WITH ME—$50 APIECE, WHICH WAS A LOT OF MONEY IN THE 1940S.
IN FACT, IT WAS ALL I HAD. BUYING MY BASS LEFT ME PENNILESS BUT HAPPY.
JEANNIE TAUGHT ME TO PLAY, AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I WAS PLAYING BASS,
BUT NOT FOR THE SAYLOR SISTERS. INSTEAD I JOINED UP WITH HOMER A. BRIERHOPPER
AND THE DIXIE DUDES, A LOCAL BAND I'D HEARD ON THE RADIO THAT PLAYED COUNTRY
SCHOOLHOUSES THROUGHOUT NORTH CAROLINA. THIS WAS DURING WORLD WAR II, AND
MOST OF THE GOOD LOCAL MUSICIANS WERE IN THE ARMY, SO OLD HOMER TURNED TO ME.
I EVEN CUT A 78-RPM RECORD WITH THE BAND IN NASHVILLE. FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD
BOY TO MAKE A RECORD IN NASHVILLE, WELL, THAT WAS REALLY SOMETHING. I MUST
ADMIT THAT IT GAVE ME A SWELLED HEAD, EVEN IF I WAS JUST A FILL-IN PLAYER FOR BAND
MEMBERS WHO WERE FIGHTING THE WAR. THEN CAME GIGS WITH THE WOODY HAYES ORCHESTRA FOR BIG MONEY—$5 A NIGHT—AND LATER OTHER JOBS AT LOCAL NIGHTCLUBS.
DURING MY LAST TWO YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS JUST ABOUT MAKING A LIVING
AS A BASS PLAYER, AND EVEN DAD HAD TO ADMIT THAT BUYING THE BASS HAD BEEN A
GOOD INVESTMENT.
RELUCTANT ACADEMIC
DAD WANTED ME TO GO TO COLLEGE, BUT I BELIEVED THAT MUSIC WOULD SUPPORT
ME WELL. SO I KEPT PLAYING NIGHTCLUB GIGS. BUT TO APPEASE MY FATHER, I ENROLLED
AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE. THE TROUBLE WAS, WITH ALL OF MY TIME SPENT PLAYING
MUSIC AND HIKING IN THE WOODS, I DIDN'T DO MUCH SCHOOLWORK. I DROPPED OUT
RIGHT BEFORE I WOULD HAVE FLUNKED OUT.
DAD WAS WORRIED, BUT I WASN'T. WITH MY MUSIC MONEY, I BOUGHT A MOTOR468
A LIFETIM E O F LOVIN G PLANT S
BIKE AND WHEELED THROUGH THE BACK ROADS OF NORTH CAROLINA, CAMPING ALL OVER
THE PLACE AND PUTTING TOGETHER MENTAL PICTURES OF THE ECOSYSTEMS OF THE INTERESTING STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA.
THEN I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM JOHNNY SATTERFIELD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH
CAROLINA (UNC) IN CHAPEL HILL. HE HAD A BIG BAND AND HAD HEARD THAT I WAS
PRETTY GOOD ON JAZZ BASS. HE WANTED TO ADD A SECOND BASS TO HIS BAND. SO OFF I
WENT TO CHAPEL HILL TO AUDITION. JOHNNY WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF DUKE ELLINGTON,
AND I THINK MY NAME TURNED HIM ON AS MUCH AS MY BASS PLAYING. HE SMILED
BROADLY AS MY BASSLINE DANCED AROUND HIS PIANO FINGERING. HE WANTED ME FOR
THE BAND AND SAID HE'D HIRE ME, BUT ONLY IF I ENROLLED IN UNC AS A MUSIC MAJOR.
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH USE FOR THE MUSIC PROGRAM AT UNC, BUT ONE OF MY FIRST
ELECTIVES WAS GENERAL BOTANY. IN SHORT ORDER, I SWITCHED MY MAJOR TO BOTANY,
MAKING IT MY VOCATION AND MUSIC MY AVOCATION. DAD WAS PLEASED. THIS TIME
AROUND, FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN BOTANY, I EARNED A'S AND BS. AND WHEN IT CAME
TIME TO MAKE A CAREER CHOICE, I ENROLLED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AT UNC.
GETTING INTIMATE WITH PLANTS
IN GRADUATE SCHOOL, I SOON TEAMED UP WITH A PROFESSOR, AL RADFORD, WHO
SPECIALIZED IN AQUATIC PLANTS. HE KNEW THAT HE AND I WERE ABOUT THE ONLY
PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO LOVED TO WADE WAIST-DEEP IN BLACKWATER SWAMPS
IN SEARCH OF RARE AQUATIC PLANTS. HE TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING, AND I WOUND UP
WRITING MY MASTER'S THESIS ON A SEMI-AQUATIC PLANT, LUDIVIGIA, THAT GREW IN
ROADSIDE DITCHES.
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE TIME THAT I WAS KNEE-DEEP IN A ROADSIDE MARSH LOOKING
FOR LUDWIGIA WHEN SOME MUSICIANS I KNEW DROVE BY. THEY STOPPED, AMAZED
THAT I WAS WADING IN THE MUCK, AND ASKED IF WAS ALL RIGHT. I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS
AS HAPPY AS A CLAM. THEY DROVE OFF, PROBABLY CONVINCED THAT I WAS CRAZY.
ANOTHER BOTANY GRAD STUDENT WAS A PETITE, BROWN-EYED BRUNETTE WHO MORE
THAN TURNED MY HEAD. I WAS INTERESTED IN PEGGY-ANN WETMORE KESSLER FROM THE
MOMENT I LAID EYES ON HER. A GRADUATE OF MARYVILLE COLLEGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF
TENNESSEE, PEGGY WAS WORKING ON HER MASTER'S AT THE TIME I MET HER.
PEGGY EARNED HER MASTER'S DEGREE, BUT SHE ENDED UP SPENDING MORE TIME
AS AN ILLUSTRATOR THAN AS A BOTANIST. SHE WORKED PART-TIME, ILLUSTRATING SEVERAL
BOTANY BOOKS PRODUCED BY OUR PROFESSORS, AND TO THIS DAY, SHE STILL ILLUSTRATES.
THE ILLUSTRATIONS THAT APPEAR THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK ARE HERS.
TOGETHER PEGGY AND I SHARED A LOVE FOR BOTANY, THE OUTDOORS AND JAZZ. AFTER
WE MET, WE SPENT MANY A WEEKEND BOUNCING FROM BOTANIZING AROUND CAROLINA
BEACHES AND FORESTS TO JAZZ JAM SESSIONS AND THEN BACK TO THE WOODS AND
BEACHES. IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE WE WERE IN LOVE.
I 46Q
AUTHOR'S POSTSCRIPT
FIRST GOVERNMENT WORK: GERM ^I^RF ARE
I COMPLETED MY MASTER'S DEGREE IN BOTANY IN 1955, AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS
FOUND MYSELF DRAFTED INTO THE U.S. ARMY. AT FIRST THE ARMY HAD NO USE FOR THE
FACT THAT I WAS A BOTANIST, BUT EVENTUALLY, AFTER A FEW HELLISH MONTHS UNDER A
SERGEANT WHO HATED COLLEGE GRADUATES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH MASTER'S DEGREES,
I WOUND UP AT FORT DIETRICK, MARYLAND. THERE I JOINED MANY OTHERS WITH
MASTER'S AND PH.D.'S IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES WHO WERE HARD AT WORK TRYING
TO DEVELOP PROTECTION FROM BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGENTS.
GERM WARFARE WASN'T EXACTLY A GREAT LOVE OF MINE, BUT OTHERWISE, FORT
DIETRICK WAS TERRIFIC. MY CIVILIAN BOSS WAS NOT VERY DEMANDING. HE HAD ME CULTURING VARIOUS FUNGI ON DIFFERENT MEDIA TO SEE HOW WELL THEY STOOD UP IN
STORAGE. HE NEVER TOLD ME WHY I WAS CULTURING FUNGI, BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO
FIGURE OUT THAT WE WERE RECIPROCATING, LOOKING FOR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS THAT COULD
DESTROY ENEMY FOOD CROPS.
WHEN I WAS OFF DUTY, I HIKED THE NEARBY CATOCTIN MOUNTAINS, WHERE I TRIED
TO DRAW THE WILDFLOWERS AS WELL AS PEGGY COULD—BUT I COULDN'T. (IRONICALLY, MY
SON, HIS CHEROKEE WIFE AND MY CHEROKEE GRANDCHILDREN LIVE THERE NOW.) I ALSO
WENT TO TOWN, NEARBY FREDERICK, WHERE I PLAYED GUITAR AND WOUND UP TEACHING
IT. BEFORE LONG, I PUT TOGETHER A SMALL JAZZ COMBO, THE DIZZY DUKE GROUP, THAT
PLAYED AT THE NCO AND OFFICERS' CLUBS.
PEGGY VISITED AS OFTEN AS WE COULD WORK IT OUT, AND WE SPENT SOME DELIGHTFUL
TIMES IN A FRIEND'S CABIN UP ON YELLOW CREEK, WHERE SHE DREW THE FLOWERS.
I WOUND UP HAVING SUCH A FINE TIME AT FORT DIETRICK THAT WHEN MY HITCH
ENDED, I WAS ALMOST SORRY TO LEAVE. BUT I WANTED TO GET MY PH.D. IN BOTANY, AND
EVEN THOUGH I NEVER FOUGHT IN KOREA, I QUALIFIED FOR THE KOREAN GI BILL. SO I
BOUGHT A BIG BLACK BUICK AND RETURNED TO UNC, WHERE I WORKED ON MY DEGREE,
HAD A TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIP AND REJOINED MY JAZZ-PLAYING BUDDIES.
TWO OF MY PROFESSORS WERE INVOLVED IN A VERY AMBITIOUS PROJECT TO OBTAIN AT
LEAST ONE SPECIMEN OF EVERY PLANT SPECIES IN EVERY COUNTY OF THE CAROLINAS IN
ORDER TO BETTER MAP THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE SPECIES. I SIGNED ON AND SO DID
PEGGY, AS THE ILLUSTRATOR. SO WE TWO LOVEBIRDS SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER AT THE
UNIVERSITY, IN THE FIELD AND AT JAZZ JAM SESSIONS.
FIRST L 00J2 AT .LATIN AMERICA
I HAD A PROBLEM. BY NOW I WAS ACADEMICALLY INBRED: I'D TAKEN ALL MY DEGREES AT THE SAME UNIVERSITY WITH THE SAME PROFESSORS, WHICH LIMITED MY EDUCATION AND MY NETWORK FOR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT.
AS I COMPLETED MY PH.D. COURSEWORK, MY ADVISER SET ME UP WITH TWO PRO470
A LIFETIME OF LOVING PLANTS
JECTS THAT GOT ME OUT OF UNC. ONE WAS AN EXPEDITION TO COLLECT BOTANICAL SPECIMENS IN MEXICO, COSTA RICA AND GUATEMALA, AND THE OTHER WAS A 6- TO 12-
MONTH JOB AT THE NOTED MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN IN ST. LOUIS, HELPING SURVEY
THE MEDICINAL PLANTS OF PANAMA AND PERU.
IT WAS HARD LEAVING PEGGY AT UNC, BUT OFF I WENT WITH ALL SORTS OF CAMPING
GEAR AND MY BEST GUITAR. OUR LITTLE GROUP DROVE TO MEXICO IN MY ADVISER'S STATION WAGON; WE WERE ON A NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT TO STUDY THE CHROMOSOMES OF THE CARROT FAMILY (UMBELLIFERAE, OR UMBELS FOR SHORT).
WE CRISS-CROSSED MEXICO FOR TWO MONTHS, SEEING ALL SORTS OF HABITATS AND
MANY UMBELS THAT WERE ALL BUT UNKNOWN OUTSIDE MEXICO. THE ITINERARY WAS
ARRANGED SO THAT WE COULD CATCH AS MANY SPECIES AS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY WERE IN
BUD. WE COLLECTED THE BUDS AND POPPED THEM INTO CHEMICALS THAT WOULD PRESERVE THEM UNTIL WE GOT BACK TO THE LAB TO COUNT THEIR CHROMOSOMES.
WE ALSO COLLECTED MANY FLOWERS, FLATTENING THEM TO PRESERVE THEM. THE
MEXICANS WE MET ALONG THE WAY WERE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO TELL US GRINGOS THE LOCAL
LORE ABOUT THE PLANTS WE WERE COLLECTING, INCLUDING THEIR MEDICAL USES. I DIDN'T
REALIZE IT AT THE TIME, BUT ON THAT TRIP THE SEEDS OF MEDICAL BOTANY WERE PLANTED
IN MY MIND.
UNFORTUNATELY, MY SPANISH WAS TOO POOR TO CATCH MOST OF WHAT OUR HOSTS
SAID. BUT SLOWLY IT IMPROVED, AND AT NIGHT IN OUR MODEST HOTEL COURTYARDS, MY
GUITAR OPENED DOORS AND MADE COMMUNICATION EASIER. THE OTHER THING I DIDN'T
REALIZE AT THE TIME WAS THAT I WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH LATIN AMERICA.
AFTER SEVERAL FASCINATING MONTHS IN MEXICO, WE FLEW INTO GUATEMALA FOR A
FEW DAYS TO FIND RARE UMBELS NEAR LAKE ATITLAN. THEN IT WAS ON TO COSTA RICA,
WHERE WE FERRETED OUT YET MORE UMBELS ON THE FLANKS OF SOME VOLCANOES. AT
EVERY STOP, MY LOVE FOR THE REGION DEEPENED.
LEARNING ABOUT MEDICINAL PLANTS
EMERGING FROM MY CENTRAL AMERICAN REVERIE, I FOUND MYSELF AT THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A POSTDOCTORAL APPOINTMENT,
LONG BEFORE I KNEW WHAT A POSTDOC WAS. AT UNC, I'D LEARNED THE PLANTS OF THE
CAROLINAS. IN MISSOURI, I WAS INTRODUCED TO PLANTS OF THE WORLD.
HALF OF MY JOB WAS TO IDENTIFY SPECIMENS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS COLLECTED IN
PERU OR, IF THEY'D NEVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED, TO NAME THEM. I'D PICK UP A
DRY, FLATTENED PERUVIAN SPECIMEN WITH SOME INDIAN OR SPANISH COLLOQUIAL NAME
AND MAYBE SOME NOTES ABOUT THE COLOR OF THE FLOWERS AND FRUITS, AND I'D HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS. BEING TRAINED IN THE DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS SCIENCE OF
TAXONOMY, I KNEW HOW TO IDENTIFY PLANTS BY THE PLACEMENT AND SHAPE OF THEIR
471
AUTHOR' S POSTSCRIP T
LEAVES AND ANCILLARY ORGANS; THE NATURE OF THE FLORAL PARTS; THE SIZE, SHAPE AND
NUMBER OF FLORAL PARTS AND SEEDS; AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THORNS, SAPS
AND PECULIAR AROMAS.
I WRESTLED INTERMITTENTLY WITH ONE MEDICINAL PLANT MY WHOLE THREE YEARS
IN MISSOURI BEFORE BECOMING CONVINCED THAT THE SPECIES HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN
NAMED. THE PERUVIANS CALLED IT SANANGO, WHICH BECAME ITS GENERIC NAME.
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON, I SAW A SHAMANISTIC HEALER
USE SANANGO IN A HEALING CEREMONY.
SOME PLANTS I KNEW WELL, SOME DIDN'T TAKE MUCH WORK TO IDENTIFY, AND
SOME TOOK MONTHS TO PIN DOWN. STILL OTHERS I NEVER IDENTIFIED FOR SURE, ALTHOUGH
I COULD USUALLY PLACE THEM IN THE RIGHT PLANT FAMILY. MONTHS OR YEARS LATER, A
SPECIALIST IN THAT FAMILY WOULD SEE THE SPECIMEN AND IDENTIFY IT OR NAME IT.
THERE ARE STILL MANY SPECIES UNKNOWN TO SCIENCE AND UNNAMED (AT LEAST IN
LATIN) IN TROPICAL AMERICA. MORE THAN A DOZEN WERE NAMED AFTER ME. IT WAS
CHALLENGING, FASCINATING WORK.
BUT ST. LOUIS WAS LARGE AND LONELY. THEN PEGGY CAME OUT. SHE TOOK AN
APARTMENT CLOSE TO THE BOTANICAL GARDEN AND GOT A JOB AS A LAB TECHNICIAN. THAT
IMPROVED THE LOCAL SCENE CONSIDERABLY.
BECOMING A SPECIALIST
THE OTHER HALF OF MY JOB WAS TO HELP THE DIRECTOR OF THE BOTANICAL GARDEN
COMPILE A CATALOG OF THE FLORA OF PANAMA. AGAIN I LOOKED ONLY AT DRIED SPECIMENS THAT OTHER SCIENTISTS HAD COLLECTED. I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE
NAMED CORRECTLY AND LIST THEIR LOCAL USES, TELLING SUBSEQUENT SCIENTISTS HOW TO
IDENTIFY THEM AND THE ILLUSTRATOR HOW TO DRAW THEM. TO CHECK ONE SPECIMEN, I
OFTEN HAD TO LOOK AT HUNDREDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAME SPECIES DIDN'T HAVE
DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC NAMES ELSEWHERE IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.
AS TEDIOUS AS IT COULD BE, I LOVED THE WORK, ALTHOUGH SUCH FLORISTIC ENDEAVORS ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS PRESTIGIOUS AMONG BOTANISTS AS MONOGRAPHIC
WORK, IN WHICH THE SCIENTIST CONCENTRATES ON A SMALL GROUP OF RELATED PLANTS,
DIGS IN AND LEARNS MORE ABOUT THEM THAN ANYONE ELSE. THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE WORLD AUTHORITY ON THEM. I WROTE A MONOGRAPH ON THE WEEDY TROPICAL
CHICKWEED, DRYMARIA, AND PEGGY ILLUSTRATED IT. TODAY, MORE THAN 30 YEARS
LATER, FM STILL THE WORLD'S LEADING EXPERT ON DRYMARIA. BUT I CAN'T RECALL THE
LAST TIME ANYONE CALLED ON THAT PARTICULAR EXPERTISE.
PEGGY AND I MARRIED IN 1960 AT THE ST. LOUIS COURTHOUSE. WE BOUGHT A
BEAT-UP HOUSE ON THE LOUTRE RIVER 80 MILES OUT OF ST. LOUIS, WHERE WE TOOK
LONG WEEKENDS. OUR SON, JOHN, WAS BORN IN ST. LOUIS ON CHRISTMAS EVE, 1961,
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE MARRIED.
IN ST. LOUIS, I ALSO CONTINUED PLAYING MUSIC AT VARIOUS CLUBS, SOME JAZZ
472
A LIFETIME OF LOVING PLANTS
COMBO GIGS AND SOME ACCOMPANYING WORK WITH JAZZ, BLUES AND COUNTRY SINGERS.
SOME BOTANISTS STILL LOOKED ASKANCE AT MY AVOCATION, BUT SOMEHOW, THE DEEPER
I DELVED INTO BOTANICAL MEDICINE WITH ITS EARTHY FOLK ROOTS, THE MORE COMFORTABLY IT "FIT" WITH THE MUSIC I PLAYED, WHICH ALSO HAD DEEP ROOTS IN THE SAME
EARTHY FOLK EXPERIENCE.
LOVINGF THE JUNGLE
IN 1961, THE U.S. MILITARY OFFERED ME A CONSULTING JOB ACCOMPANYING
SWAMP FOX I, AN EXPEDITION TO THE REMOTE DARIEN PROVINCE OF PANAMA AND THE
SO-CALLED DARIEN GAP, THE ONLY REMAINING HOLE IN THE INTER-AMERICAN HIGHWAY
LINKING ALASKA AND CHILE. MILITARY VEHICLES WERE TRYING TO OPEN A ROAD THROUGH
THIS MUDDY RAIN FOREST, WITH LITTLE SUCCESS. MY JOB WAS TO DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENT
TYPES OF VEGETATION AND IDENTIFY WHICH WERE BEST SUITED TO SUPPORTING VEHICULAR TRAFFIC. I JUMPED AT THE CHANCE.
MY FIRST NIGHT IN A PALM-THATCHED SHACK IN DARIEN, A BIG IGUANA DROPPED
FROM THE RAFTERS RIGHT ONTO ME, ALMOST SCARING ME TO DEATH. THE SECOND NIGHT
THE ROAR OF A DISTANT HOWLER MONKEY WAS EQUALLY ALARMING. BUT AS ALWAYS, THE
LOCAL PEOPLE WERE GRACIOUS, AND THEY WERE HAPPY TO TELL ME ALL THEY KNEW ABOUT
THE AREA'S PLANTS, INCLUDING THEIR MEDICINAL USES.
MY SPANISH WAS STILL ONLY RUDIMENTARY, BUT I KEPT WORKING ON IT, AND LITTLE
BY LITTLE, IT GOT BETTER. ETHNOBOTANY, THE STUDY OF HOW NATIVE PEOPLES USE THEIR
LOCAL PLANTS, WAS STILL IN ITS INFANCY AT THE TIME. IN FACT, THE WORD ETHNOBOTANY
DIDN'T BECOME WIDELY USED UNTIL SOME YEARS LATER, BUT I WAS ALREADY HIP-DEEP
INTO IT, LITERALLY, THERE IN THE BUSH OF DARIEN.
I MADE SEVERAL SWAMP FOX TRIPS TO PANAMA, AND I LOVED WORKING WITH TROPICAL PLANTS IN THE WILD. COMPARED WITH THE WONDER AND ADVENTURE OF MY DARIEN
EXPEDITIONS, MY WORK AT THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN, STUDYING DEAD, DRY
SPECIMENS OF THE SAME PLANTS, BEGAN TO LOOK PRETTY DULL. I BEGAN TO PUT OUT
FEELERS FOR ANOTHER JOB.
I WOUND UP AT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RESEARCH STATION, THE
RESEARCH HEART OF THE USD A, IN BELTS VILLE, MARYLAND. I SPENT MOST OF THE REST
OF MY CAREER THERE, FROM 1963 TO 1995.
RIGHT AWAY, I GOT INVOLVED IN A LATIN AMERICAN PROJECT, THIS TIME A STUDY
OF SUCCESSION—THE NATURAL CHANGES IN PLANT POPULATIONS OVER TIME—IN TROPICAL PUERTO RICO. I LEARNED TO IDENTIFY TROPICAL TREES BY THEIR SEEDS AND
SEEDLINGS.
I WAS HAPPY TO LEARN TO DO THIS, BUT I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE REASON BEHIND
THE PROJECT, WHICH WAS TO CHECK HOW HERBICIDES (READ "DEFOLIANTS") MIGHT ALTER
THE NORMAL SUCCESSION OF TREE SEEDLINGS IN TROPICAL FORESTS. I ALSO SPENT SOME
TIME AS CURATOR OF THE USDA SEED COLLECTION.

AUTHOR'S POSTSCRIPT
FOCUSING ON MEDICINAL HERBS
TWO YEARS INTO THIS USDA PROGRAM, I GOT A CALL FROM THE BATTELLE MEMORIAL INSTITUTE, A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. BATTELLE HAD LANDED
A BIG CONTRACT FROM THE OLD ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF
A SEA-LEVEL CANAL ACROSS PANAMA AND COLOMBIA. IT MAY SOUND CRAZY NOW, BUT
THE IDEA WAS TO USE SUPPOSEDLY CLEAN, LOW-POWER NUCLEAR "DEVICES" (BOMBS) TO
BLAST THIS CANAL THROUGH THE RAIN FOREST TO SAVE SHIPS THE HASSLE OF THE LOCKS IN
THE PANAMA CANAL.
BATTELLE NEEDED A BOTANIST ON THE TEAM, AND MY FUTURE BOSS LEARNED THAT I
HAD A GOOD DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN PANAMA AND WITH PANAMANIAN FLORA. ONCE
AGAIN, I JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO LATIN AMERICA.
I HAD NO IDEA THEN, BUT THE BATTELLE PROJECT CHANGED MY LIFE. IT MARKED MY
CONVERSION FROM A BOTANIST TO AN ETHNOBOTANIST FOCUSED ON MEDICINAL HERBS.
THE BATTELLE PROJECT WAS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME, BUT IT BEGAN AS QUITE A
NIGHTMARE FOR PEGGY. WE HAD A NEARLY FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON AND A SIX-MONTH-OLD
DAUGHTER, CELIA, AND HERE I WANTED TO PULL UP STAKES AND MOVE US FROM BELTSVILLE
TO PANAMA—IN A HOWLING SNOWSTORM, NO LESS. SOMEHOW, THOUGH, WE SURVIVED
THE TRIP, AS WELL AS SIX WEEKS IN A FLEABAG HOTEL IN THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE.
WE ALSO SURVIVED GROSS CULTURE SHOCK AND THE SIX WEEKS AND TWO LAWYERS
IT TOOK TO GET THROUGH THE FORMALITIES AND FREE OUR EARTHLY GOODS FROM CUSTOMS
AND GET THEM MOVED TO OUR APARTMENT IN EL CANGREJO, WHICH WAS, BY PANAMANIAN STANDARDS, A WELL-TO-DO SUBURB OF PANAMA CITY.
LIVING IN PANAMA
AT FIRST I WAS UNHAPPY THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO LIVE IN THE CANAL ZONE,
WHICH WAS VERY AMERICAN. BUT AS I WAS A PRIVATE CONSULTANT NOT DIRECTLY EMPLOYED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THERE WAS NO HOUSING FOR US IN THE ZONE. HOWEVER, IN SHORT ORDER, WE CHANGED OUR MINDS. THE CANAL ZONE WAS LIKE LIVING IN
FLORIDA. WHERE WE WERE, WE LIVED IN PANAMA. WHEN PM IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, I
LIKE TO SETTLE INTO THE CULTURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, WHICH IS WHAT WE DID.
THINGS IN PANAMA WERE NOT EASY FOR PEGGY. SHE DID NOT SPEAK SPANISH AND
HAD TO COPE WITH THE MANY CHALLENGES OF LIVING IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, ALWAYS WITH
TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN TOW AND OFTEN WITHOUT HER HUSBAND AROUND FOR WEEKS ON
END. BUT DESPITE ALL THE HEADACHES, SHE ENJOYED ONE WONDERFUL, UNEXPECTED
PERK. FOR THE ONLY TIME IN HER LIFE, SHE HAD A LIVE-IN MAID, EDITH BRISTAN, THE
SISTER OF MY MOST IMPORTANT PANAMANIAN RAIN FOREST GUIDE, NARCISO BRISTAN.
ALMOST ALL OF THE APARTMENTS IN OUR SUBURB HAD MAID'S QUARTERS, AND INCREDIBLY, WE COULD AFFORD LIVE-IN HELP. SO WE ASKED EDITH TO MOVE IN. SHE WAS
474
A LIFETIME O F LOVIN G PLANT S
GREAT WITH THE KIDS AND GREAT COMPANY FOR PEGGY. BEING OF THAT CULTURE, SHE
TAUGHT US ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS OF PANAMANIAN LIFE THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN YEARS
FOR US TO LEARN ON OUR OWN.
BY THIS TIME, AFTER MY SWAMP FOX EXPERIENCES, MY SPANISH WAS FAIRLY DECENT, AND ONE OF MY JOBS WAS TO TALK WITH ALL THE PANAMANIANS, BLACK, WHITE
AND INDIAN, ABOUT WHAT THEY ATE FROM THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. WHY? TO PUT IT
CRUDELY: IF THE UNITED STATES DUG THAT DITCH USING NUCLEAR BOMBS, HOW LONG
WOULD WE HAVE TO KEEP THE LOCALS FROM LIVING THEIR LOCAL LIVES—SIX DAYS, SIX
MONTHS, SIX YEARS, SIX CENTURIES OR SIX MILLENNIA?
OF COURSE, THE PANAMANIANS KNEW WHY WE WERE THERE AND WERE QUICK TO
ASK HOW MANY CANALS THE UNITED STATES WAS PLANNING TO DIG IN THE 50 STATES
USING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THEY WERE ALWAYS GRACIOUS, BUT THEIR POINT WAS QUITE
CLEAR, AND AFTER MY MORE THAN TWO-YEAR STAY IN PANAMA, UNCLE SAM DECIDED
THAT IT WAS NOT FEASIBLE—BIOLOGICALLY, GEOLOGICALLY AND POLITICALLY—TO BUILD
THIS CANAL WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
PLANTS YIELD. THEIR HEALING SECRETS
THE BOMB BUSINESS MAY HAVE BEEN THE REASON I WAS IN PANAMA, BUT ACTUALLY, IT DIDN'T INTRUDE MUCH ON WHAT I DID FROM DAY TO DAY. I SPENT MOST OF MY
TIME TRAVELING THROUGH THE THICK, LUSH RAIN FOREST OF DARIEN, ALWAYS BY BOAT BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ROADS. LED BY VARIOUS PANAMANIAN AND INDIAN GUIDES WHO
BECAME MY FRIENDS, I VISITED THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF THE FOREST. WITH CAMERA
AND TAPE RECORDER, I DOCUMENTED HOW THEY LIVED AND WHAT THEY ATE, ALWAYS
DELVING AT LENGTH INTO THE LOCAL MEDICINAL HERBS AND HOW THEY WERE USED. IT WAS
A FASCINATING TWO YEARS, AND I RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES MORE CONVINCED
THAN EVER THAT I WOULD FOCUS MY CAREER ON HERBAL MEDICINES.
SOME EXPERIENCES REMAIN VIVID IN MY MEMORY, EVEN AFTER 30 YEARS. ON ONE
TRIP INTO THE BUSH, OUR GROUP DECIDED TO CLIMB CERRO PIRRE, AN ENCHANTING
5,000-FOOT PEAK NEAR THE COLOMBIAN BORDER. IT WAS A SLOW, TWO-DAY, HAND-OVERHAND CLIMB THROUGH THICK VEGETATION. OUR CHOCO INDIAN PORTERS HANDLED THE
RIGORS MUCH BETTER THAN WE GRINGOS DID.
WE ALL WORE HIGH, THICK BOOTS TO PROTECT US FROM THE MANY SNAKES, AND I
WISHED I HAD LEATHER GLOVES AS WELL BECAUSE MY HANDS GOT CUT UP SOMETHING
FIERCE BY THE VEGETATION, MUCH OF WHICH I WAS COLLECTING ALONG THE WAY. THE FIRST
NIGHT, SOME OF OUR GUIDES WENT AHEAD TO LOOK FOR A GOOD CAMPSITE, AND WHEN
THEY FOUND ONE, THEY BUILT A FIRE WHOSE SMOKE TOOK US TO THEM.
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE CLEARING THEY'D DISCOVERED, WE SAW NOT ONLY
THE FIRE BUT ALSO SOMETHING RIGHT OUT OF SOME HOLLYWOOD JUNGLE MOVIE—WHAT
4 7 5
AUTHOR' S POSTSCRIP T
LOOKED LIKE MINIATURE HUMAN SKULLS ON SKEWERS. OUR SHARPSHOOTING CHOCO
PORTERS HAD HUNTED UP SOME MEAT, IN THIS CASE WHITE-FACED MONKEYS.
AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF LITTLE MORE THAN RICE, BEANS AND WHAT THE CHOCO AND I
COULD FORAGE, I WELCOMED BARBECUED MONKEY, EVEN THOUGH IT FELT A LITTLE CANNIBALISTIC TO EAT IT. WE GOT SOME RATHER GROTESQUE PICTURES OF THE GUIDES SUCKING
THE BRAINS OUT OF THE MONKEY SKULLS.
A BIGGER SURPRISE LAY IN STORE FOR US THE NEXT DAY. AFTER CLIMBING TO THE
PEAK, WE MADE IT BACK DOWN TO THE RIVER, WHERE SOME OF OUR GUIDES LIVED IN A
GROUP OF HUTS. IT TURNED OUT THAT ONE OF THE MONKEYS WE'D EATEN HAD A BABY,
WHICH OUR GUIDE RECOVERED ON THE WAY DOWN. IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE, ONE OF THE
PORTERS GAVE THE BABY MONKEY TO HIS WIFE, WHO IMMEDIATELY OFFERED HER BREAST
TO THE MONKEY TO NURSE. NO ONE WAS SURPRISED BUT ME AND MY FELLOW GRINGOS. I
TOOK A PICTURE OF THAT CHOCO MOTHER NURSING A MONKEY ON ONE BREAST AND HER
BABY ON THE OTHER. THAT PICTURE WAS PUBLISHED IN ECONOMIC BOTANY.
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SCENE YEARS LATER, WHEN EBOLA VIRUS WAS IN THE NEWS
AND PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW NEW VIRAL DISEASES MIGHT MOVE FROM MONKEYS TO HUMANS. THE NEWS MEDIA NEVER MENTIONED NURSING, BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY
ONE POSSIBLE WAY.
SURVIVING IN THE JUNGLE
BEING A BOTANIST, I PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE UNIQUE PLANT SPICES OF THE
TROPICS. IN PANAMA, THE CULINARY HERB OF CHOICE IN THE BUSH WAS CULANTRO, A
CLOSE RELATIVE OF CORIANDER, WHICH HAS THE SAME CHEMISTRY AND FLAVOR. IT REALLY
HELPED WITH SOME OF THOSE JUNGLE MEATS.
ONE JUNGLE MEAT, NAMELY TURTLE, GREATLY INCREASED MY GROWING RESPECT FOR
HERBAL MEDICINE. ON ONE COLLECTING TRIP, WE CAMPED ON THE BANKS OF RIO PIRRE,
AND OUR GUIDES CAUGHT SOME TURTLES FOR STEW. (THEY WEREN'T CONSIDERED ENDANGERED THEN.)
SOON AFTER THAT MEAL, I DEVELOPED A BAD CASE OF SALMONELLA FOOD POISONING.
(LATER I SAW A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE DOCUMENTING A HIGH INCIDENCE OF SALMONELLA IN
TURTLE POPULATIONS IN DARIEN.) THE DIARRHEA WAS VIOLENT AND TERRIBLE, AND I BECAME SO WEAK THAT I WAS UNABLE TO STAND UP, LET ALONE WORK.
I INVESTED SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MAINSTREAM PANAMANIAN PHYSICIANS
AND THEIR U.S.-STYLE PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINES. THEY HELPED A LITTLE, BUT I REMAINED QUITE ILL. THEN A MORE HERBALLY INCLINED PANAMANIAN DOCTOR GAVE ME
POWDERED CAROB, AND IT HELPED QUITE A BIT. THIRTY YEARS LATER, IN 1995,1 READ A
STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY AND NUTRITION SHOWING THAT
CAROB POWDER IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A TREATMENT FOR INFANT DIARRHEA. I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST THAT IT WORKS.
476
A LIFETIME OF LOVING PLANTS
FORNIING FRIENDSHIPS AMONG THE INDIANS
SINCE BOYHOOD ROMPS IN THE NORTH CAROLINA FORESTS, I'D BEEN INTERESTED IN
LIVING OFF THE LAND, AND THOSE SKILLS CAME IN HANDY IN PANAMA. ONCE A FEW OF
US GRINGOS AND MY GUIDE-BUDDY NARCISO BRISTAN (OUR MAID'S BROTHER) SPENT SEVERAL DAYS DEEP IN THE BUSH AND RAN LOW ON RATIONS. WE SUBSISTED ON THE REMAINS
OF OUR RICE, DRY BEANS AND FLOUR, SUPPLEMENTED BY LOCAL FRUITS AND ROOTS THAT I
FORAGED, PLUS GAME SKILLFULLY SHOT BY NARCISO.
LITTLE BY LITTLE I BECAME INTIMATE WITH THE FORESTS AND PEOPLE OF EASTERN
PANAMA, WHO GAVE ME SOME INTERESTING INDIAN NAMES. WITH THE GREGARIOUS VILLAGE-DWELLING KUNA INDIANS, I WAS TUTU-SIPU-NELE-MERGUI (GRINGO WITCH DOCTOR
WHITE FLOWER). THE CHOCO INDIANS CALLED MEJAIBANA BOROJO (WITCH DOCTOR
BOROJO). (BOROJO IS A TREE RELATED TO COFFEE BUT WITH GRAPEFRUIT-SIZE FRUITS THAT
ARE USED TO MAKE A FERMENTED BEVERAGE CALLED CHICHA.)
EVERYWHERE I WENT, I ALWAYS ASKED TO BE SHOWN THE LOCAL MEDICINAL PLANTS,
AND I TALKED WITH THE LOCAL HERBALISTS AND SHAMANISTIC HEALERS ABOUT HOW THEY
USED THEM.
IN MY 2½ YEARS IN PANAMA (WITH SOME TIME IN NORTHWESTERN COLOMBIA AS
WELL), MY TEAM COLLECTED NEARLY 15,000 SPECIMENS, MANY RARE AND VALUABLE
FINDS FROM THE WETTEST, MOST VEGETATION-RICH AREA IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
SOME ARE NOW AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, AND MORE ARE AT THE MISSOURI
BOTANICAL GARDEN. FROM A FIELD BOTANY PERSPECTIVE, THE PROJECT WAS A MAJOR
SUCCESS, AND I HOPE I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DECISION NOT TO SET OFF NUCLEAR BOMBS IN THAT WONDERFUL, FASCINATING, FRAGILE REGION. TRUTH BE TOLD, PD
FALLEN MADLY IN LOVE WITH LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY PANAMA, THE CHOCO INDIANS, ETHNOBOTANY AND HERBAL MEDICINE. PD BECOME A "PANAMANIAC."
BUT ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END, AND IN 1968, THE FAMILY AND I RETURNED
TO THE UNITED STATES, TO BATTELLE'S MAIN OFFICE IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. WHAT A TRANSITION. NO RAIN FOREST, NO EXTENDED EXPEDITIONS INTO THE BUSH, AND NO LIVE-IN
MAID AT HOME FOR PEGGY AND THE KIDS. BUT SOMEONE HAD TO WRITE UP ALL OUR
BOTANICAL DATA FROM THE PANAMA PROJECT, AND IT FELL TO YOURS TRULY.
I WOUND UP WITH A WHOLE STRING OF JOURNAL ARTICLES, INCLUDING QUITE A FEW
ETHNOBOTANICAL PAPERS ABOUT HERBAL MEDICINE. I ALSO PUBLISHED MY FIRST BOOK,
THE ISTHMIAN ETHNOBOTANICAL DICTIONARY.
THEN FUNDS RAN LOW, AND BATTELLE HAD NO MORE MONEY FOR THE PANAMA PROJECT. THE MONEY WAS IN A NEW PROJECT FOCUSING ON THE ECOLOGY OF AMCHITKA, AN
ISLAND OFF PACIFIC ALASKA. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE BEAUTY AND ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE NORTHERN LATITUDES, I WAS SMITTEN BY THE TROPICS. WHEN BATTELLE
HINTED THAT I MIGHT BE SENT TO THE NORTH SLOPE OF ALASKA, I KNEW WE HAD COME
TO A PARTING OF THE WAYS.
477
AUTHOR'S POSTSCRIPT
INVESTIGATING A DIFFERENT KIND OF DRUGS
ONCE AGAIN, THE USDA CAME TO MY RESCUE. I WAS INVITED BACK TO BELTSVILLE
IN 1971 TO WORK ON A PROGRAM THAT INVOLVED HERBAL MEDICINE, BUT NOT THE KIND
I ADVOCATE USING.
IN LOOKING TO LEAVE BATTELLE, I'D DRAFTED A PROPOSAL ON THE FEASIBILITY OF GENETICALLY SUBVERTING MARIJUANA TO MAKE IT UNAPPEALING TO ITS USERS. THE EUPHORIA-PRODUCING COMPOUND IN MARIJUANA IS TETRA-HYDROCANNABINOL (THC). THE
HIGHER THE THC LEVEL, THE MORE POTENT THE POT. I PROPOSED TO BREED MARIJUANA
WITH NEXT TO NO THC AND THEN SPREAD THE SEED JOHNNY APPLESEED-STYLE IN
AREAS WHERE HIGH-THC POT WAS BEING ILLEGALLY GROWN. I ARGUED THAT NATURAL
CROSS-BREEDING WOULD EVENTUALLY LOWER THE POTENCY OF ALL THE LOCAL MARIJUANA.
FRANKLY, I HAD NO IDEA IF MY NOTION WOULD WORK, BUT THE USDA LIKED THE PROPOSAL.
WE BOUGHT A NICE SUBURBAN HOUSE ON A HALF-ACRE LOT WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF MY OFFICE AT BELTSVILLE. BUT WITHIN A YEAR, AND WITH A LOAN FROM
MOMMA, WE BOUGHT A GREAT SIX-ACRE FARM WITH A BRICK RANCH HOUSE.
I WANTED TO GROW GRAPES ORGANICALLY, REPELLING INSECTS AND DISEASES WITH
AROMATIC HERBS, SO I INTERCROPPED FRENCH GRAPES WITH OLD-FASHIONED AROMATIC
HERBS. AFTER A WHILE, THE HERBS TOOK OVER FROM THE GRAPES, BUT NONETHELESS, I
CALLED THE FARM HERBAL VINEYARD. TODAY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF HERB SPECIES,
PLUS BLUEBERRIES, BLACKBERRIES, GRAPES, RASPBERRIES AND WINEBERRIES, ALL PRETTY
MUCH UNTENDED.
SHORTLY AFTER I RETURNED TO THE USDA, THERE WAS A DRAMATIC REORGANIZATION
AT BELTSVILLE. I WAS MADE CHIEF OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE PLANT TAXONOMY LABORATORY, WHICH DEALT IN PART WITH NARCOTICS. BEFORE I KNEW IT, I WAS SENT BACK TO MY
BELOVED LATIN AMERICA TO HELP THE STATE DEPARTMENT HELP BOLIVIA, PERU AND
ECUADOR CLAMP DOWN ON CULTIVATION OF COCA, THE PLANT SOURCE OF COCAINE.
I ALSO VISITED BURMA, CAMBODIA, LAOS, THAILAND AND VIETNAM TO HELP LIMIT
CULTIVATION OF THE OPIUM POPPY. MY JOB WAS NOT TO ERADICATE THESE CROPS, HOWEVER. AFTER ALL, THEY WERE BEING GROWN BECAUSE THEY WERE A LUCRATIVE CASH CROP
FOR VERY POOR PEOPLE. MY CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENT WAS TO DEVELOP A CATALOG OF
LEGAL USEFUL PLANTS THAT MIGHT BE GROWN AS SUBSTITUTE CASH CROPS. CAN YOU GUESS
WHAT I SUGGESTED? MEDICINAL HERBS.
WORKING WITN MEDICINAL HERBS
IN 1977,1 GOT A MEDICINAL HERBALIST'S DREAM JOB AS CHIEF OF THE USDA
MEDICINAL PLANT LABORATORY, WHOSE MAIN FUNCTION WAS TO COLLECT MEDICINAL
PLANTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM BEING RUN CO478
A LIFETIME O F LOVIN G PLANT S
OPERATIVELY BY THE USDA AND THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE.
I INHERITED A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS WHO HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN COLLECTING POTENTIALLY CANCER-FIGHTING PLANTS FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. (ONE WAS JUDI DUCELLIER, WHO BECAME MY CAREER-LONG RIGHT-HAND WOMAN. SHE'S STILL WITH ME. SHE
RODE HERD ON THIS BOOK THROUGH THE ENTIRE EDITORIAL PROCESS.) THE CANCER
SCREENING PROGRAM EVENTUALLY ANALYZED 10 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S KNOWN PLANT
SPECIES FOR ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY AND HELPED POINT THE WAY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
SEVERAL CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS NOW IN USE, INCLUDING TAXOL FROM THE YEW
TREE, WHICH IS USED FOR FIGHTING ADVANCED BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER.
I DUG RIGHT INTO THE MEDICINAL PLANT LAB, EXCITED ABOUT MY FIRST FORMAL JOB
THAT WAS FULLY DEVOTED TO MEDICINAL PLANTS. I TRAVELED THE GLOBE ON COLLECTING
TRIPS TO CHINA, ECUADOR, EGYPT, PANAMA, CHILE, HONDURAS, SYRIA AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. WHILE IN EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES, I ALSO TALKED WITH LOCAL
EXPERTS ABOUT ALL THE OTHER LOCAL MEDICINAL PLANTS THAT THEY USED FOR PURPOSES
OTHER THAN CANCER TREATMENT.
THE CANCER SCREENING PROJECT WAS A HUGE EFFORT, AND MY OWN INTEREST IN
OTHER MEDICINAL PLANTS MADE IT EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS. I NEEDED A WAY TO CATALOG
AND EASILY RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION I WAS GATHERING FROM BOTH FOLK MEDICINAL
AND SCIENTIFIC SOURCES. THAT LED TO MY NOW-HUGE MEDICINAL PLANT COMPUTER
DATABASE, THE SOURCE FOR MUCH OF THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK. IF YOU HAVE A
COMPUTER, MODEM AND WORLD WIDE WEB BROWSER, YOU CAN ACCESS IT YOURSELF AT
HTTP://WWW.ARS-GRIN.GOV/~NGRLSB/.
I WAS BECOMING KNOWN AS ONE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF MEDICINAL HERB EXPERTS
AT THE USDA, AND THAT LED TO SEVERAL SIDE PROJECTS, SUCH AS MY FIRST TRIP TO
CHINA IN 1978 TO STUDY ASIAN GINSENG (PANAX GINSENG) AND THE RELATED PLANT,
SIBERIAN GINSENG (ELEUTHEROCOCCUS SENTICOSUS). I HAD BROUGHT ALONG A POUND OF
AMERICAN GINSENG SEED (PANAX QUINQUEFOLIUS) AS A GIFT, IN HOPES OF RECEIVING A
POUND OF ASIAN GINSENG SEED IN RETURN. ALTHOUGH MY HOSTS SAID THAT IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR ANYONE TO TAKE THE SEED OF EITHER ASIAN OR SIBERIAN GINSENG OUT OF
CHINA, I MANAGED TO COME HOME WITH A SOUVENIR: SEVERAL FLATTENED TWIGS AND
LEAVES OF SIBERIAN GINSENG. ON A WHIM, I PLANTED THE TWIGS, AND THEY SPROUTED,
MAKING ME AN INADVERTENT SMUGGLER OF GINSENG.
CANCER RESEARCH FUNDING DRIES UP
BY 1981, MY LABORATORY'S ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM
WAS A HALF-MILLION DOLLARS, AND I WAS DOING SUCH EXCITING WORK THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE THE STORM CLOUDS GATHERING IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.
INSTEAD, I VISITED CHINA WITH DR. JAMES REVEAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARY479
AUTHOR'S POSTSCRIPT
LAND, WITH A GOAL OF COLLECTING AS MANY MEDICINAL PLANTS AS POSSIBLE. BUT ONCE
AGAIN, THE CHINESE HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA. WE ONLY GOT TO COLLECT IN ONE REAL FOREST
IN KUNMING IN SOUTHWEST CHINA. OTHERWISE, WE SPENT OUR TIME IN BOTANICAL GARDENS OR HERBAL APOTHECARIES OR RESEARCH FACILITIES. NEVERTHELESS, WE VISITED
HARBIN, BEIJING, CHUNKING, KUNMING, NANJING AND SHANGHAI AND RETURNED
WITH SOME 300 SPECIES FOR THE CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM.
SHORTLY AFTER WE GOT BACK, RONALD REAGAN SHUT THE PROGRAM DOWN AND MY
LABORATORY ALONG WITH IT. (I CONTINUED TO RESEARCH BOTANICAL APPROACHES TO
CANCER TREATMENT, BUT I DID IT AT HOME ON MY OWN TIME.)
AFTER A BRIEF, UNHAPPY STINT WORKING ON TRYING TO IMPROVE WHEAT'S DISEASE
RESISTANCE BY BREEDING DOMESTIC WHEAT WITH SEVERAL WILD SPECIES, IN 1982 I RETURNED TO THE NARCOTICS PROGRAM AT THE USDA. THIS MOVE ALLOWED ME TO RETURN TO
MY BELOVED TROPICS, LOOKING AGAIN INTO ALTERNATIVE CROPS FOR COCAINE, MARIJUANA
AND OPIUM POPPY. THE JOB TOOK ME TO HAWAII, PUERTO RICO AND THAILAND, AND
AT EVERY STOP, I ADDED MATERIAL TO MY EVER-EXPANDING MEDICINAL PLANT DATABASE.
SKARM^TKE RAIN FOREST
THEN, IN 1991, A PIVOTAL EVENT OCCURRED: I RECEIVED MY FIRST INVITATION TO
TEACH A MEDICINAL PLANT WORKSHOP TO AN ECOTOURIST GROUP IN AMAZONIAN PERU,
ABOUT 200 MILES DOWNRIVER FROM THE UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY, WHERE FD FIRST
LOOKED INTO ALTERNATIVES TO COCA FARMING YEARS EARLIER DURING MY FIRST STINT WITH
THE NARCOTICS PROGRAM. I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT SPENDING A WEEK IN THE
AMAZON, BUT RIGHT BEFORE I WAS TO GO, I SLIPPED A DISK IN MY BACK WHILE TRANSPORTING A CHRISTMAS TREE. (IF YOU WANT THE GORY DETAILS, YOU CAN READ THE CHAPTER
ON BACKACHE ON PAGE 71.)
I CANCELED THE ECOTOUR WORKSHOP BUT THEN RECONSIDERED, FIGURING I'D BE IN
PAIN EITHER WAY. WHY NOT AT LEAST BE IN THE AMAZON?
SO I WENT, AND I CONSIDER IT AMONG THE BEST DECISIONS I EVER MADE. BY THE
END OF THE WEEK, MY PAIN WAS MUCH LESS INTENSE, IN PART, I THINK, BECAUSE I
TOOK CONTROL OF MY OWN MEDICAL CARE AND IN PART BECAUSE I USED SO MANY HERBAL
MEDICINES. IN FACT, I DEDICATED THAT WORKSHOP TO THE TROPICAL PAPAYA TREE, THE
SOURCE OF CHYMOPAPAIN, A DRUG USED TO TREAT SLIPPED DISKS.
THAT FIRST ECOTOUR LED TO MANY OTHERS, IN BELIZE, COSTA RICA AND PERU, AND
NOW TANZANIA AND KENYA. THESE TRIPS HELPED JUDI AND ME COMPILE OUR BOOK
THE CRC HANDBOOK OF ALTERNATIVE CASH CROPS FOR THE TROPICS. AND MY MANTRIPS TO PERU LED TO MY AMAZONIAN ETHNOBOTANICAL DICTIONARY, CO-AUTHORED WITHTHE EXCELLENT PERUVIAN BOTANIST RODOLFO VASQUEZ MARTINEZ, WHO PATIENTLY ANSWERED MY INCESSANT QUESTIONS AS WE TRAVELED ALONG THE AMAZON AND NAPO
RIVERS IN PERU.
480
A LIFETIME O F LOVIN G PLANT S
BY 1997, I'D BEEN INVOLVED IN MORE THAN 30 WEEK-LONG TROPICAL ECOTOURS,
WHERE I WORKED AS A FIELD INSTRUCTOR TEACHING ABOUT THE MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE
RAIN FOREST. I EVEN HAD A TOLL-FREE NUMBER SO THAT PEOPLE COULD CALL FOR INFORMATION ABOUT PHARMACY ECOTOURS.
RETIRING TO HARDER W)RK
THEN BY CHANCE, ALICE FEINSTEIN, A BOOK EDITOR AT RODALE PRESS, CONTACTED
ME TO SAY THAT SHE ADMIRED MY WORK WITH HERBAL MEDICINE AND ASKED IF I WOULD
LIKE TO WRITE A BOOK FOR RODALE. I SAID FD LOVE TO. BUT I HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE
USDA TO FIND THE TIME TO DO IT, AND I DID SO IN 1995. THOSE YEARS WITH THE
USDA TOOK ME AROUND THE WORLD MANY TIMES, LEARNING ABOUT THE MEDICINAL
PLANTS IN THE GREEN PHARMACY.
RETIREMENT HAS ALLOWED ME TO DO MORE THAN JUST WRITE THIS BOOK. FVE BECOME DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE AMAZON CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
AND RESEARCH (ACEER), WITH ITS U.S. BASE IN HELENA, ALABAMA. FVE BECOME A
CONSULTANT FOR THE AMERICAN BOTANICAL COUNCIL IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, HERBALIFE IN
LOS ANGELES AND NATURE'S HERBS IN AMERICAN FORK, UTAH.
TODAY I'M AS BUSY AS I EVER WAS, WORKING TO SAVE THE AMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST
WHILE TRYING TO PERSUADE ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN THAT HERBAL ALTERNATIVES OFTEN
WORK AS WELL AS OR BETTER THAN PHARMACEUTICALS. THE GREEN PHARMACY FURTHERS
BOTH OF THESE OBJECTIVES.
JOIN ME IN THE AMAZON, FRIENDS, AND THINK GREEN. IF WE ALL GIVE HERBAL
MEDICINES THE CHANCE THEY DESERVE, BOTANICAL MEDICINE WILL SPREAD LIKE KUDZU,
AND THE WORLD WILL BE THE BETTER FOR IT.
